[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-338, Sheriff v. Gillie. Mr. Murphy. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Given resource constraints, Ohio law has always authorized its attorney general to appoint special counsel to undertake the attorney general's duty of representing the State in the courts.   While the attorney general may appoint general deputies today, special counsel remain integral to the office.   For example, the office has only 15 assistant attorneys general dedicated to collecting the billions of dollars of State debts scattered across all 88 Ohio counties.   The office necessarily must rely on special counsel to be the frontline lawyers to collect these debts, yet the Sixth Circuit in this case held both that special counsel are not attorney general officers and may not use attorney general letterhead without risking liability under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. That was mistaken for two basic reasons. First, special counsel are State officers under that Act.   And so they fall within the government exemption designed to protect government operations. And, second, special counsel's use of attorney general letterhead accurately conveyed their relationship to the office and furthered the purposes of the Act by putting the credibility of the office on the line and giving it a powerful incentive to monitor special counsel when they collect these debts. So I would like to begin first with the first question presented, the officer question.   And the briefs have gone back and forth on what officer can mean historically and on what it should mean for the Act.   I think -- I think what it should mean for the Act is -- is that the broadest conceivable definition should apply, precisely because this provision is designed to protect government operations. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " May I ask you about the -- the general structure of the Act seems to be in-house collectors are okay, but outside collectors, whether for private or for government, fall under the Act. But do I understand your view correctly that that line doesn't exist for the State; that is, whether it's an in-house or an out-house collector, they're equally exempt? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " I agree that -- I -- yes, you understand our position correctly.   I do not think that the in-house/out-house -- outside dichotomy makes sense for purposes of the government exemption. And here's why: The prototypical -- in the legislative history, the sheriffs and marshals, as the prototypical exempt debt collectors for the government, and they are always outside of the private creditors who are the judgment creditors. So there are a core group of outside collectors -- the in -- outside of the creditor, that is -- who are the prototypical examples -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, why wouldn't Congress have expressed that more clearly? I mean, that's a big thing that you're saying, that the State debt collectors really ought to be treated very differently, the outside debt collectors from the private. And, on the face of the statute, the private and the State really are treated in exactly the same way.   There are two provisions.   They read identically to each other.   And surely there were very clear ways of taking out the State outside debt collectors.   You could have just said State debts aren't debts for purposes of this statute or State outside debt collectors aren't debt collectors for purposes of this statute, and yet Congress did none of those things.   Rather, Congress adopted a set of provisions that seem perfectly parallel with respect to State and corporate entities. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " So I disagree that they're perfectly parallel in these ways. First, I think \"officer\" means something different in the government context than it does in the private context.   In the private context, as we cite Black's Law Dictionary, the prototypical officer is the president, the CEO, or the treasurer, high-level managers. But not -- that's not true for the government.   The prototypical Officer can be ministerial officers, like police officers -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I understand the argument that you can read the same term two different ways, but Congress did use the exact same terms. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " But it -- but one is in the private context and one is in the government context.   So I think, by definition, they have to have different meanings. And, number two, the inside/outside, you can see that with the creditor, because when the creditor collects, the creditor has to collect in their own name.   If you look at the creditor exemption, (6)(A) -- a(6)(A), it says they're exempt if they collect in their own name. And, in fact, when they don't collect in their own name, in-house creditors become debt collectors, showing how the in-house/outside was supposed to work for creditors because, when you put your -- Congress has made the choice with respect to creditors, when you put your name on the line, the creditor will likely have a repeat relationship with the relevant debtor.   And so goodwill was enough to exempt all inside creditors.   You don't see this dichotomy -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What other -- what other position does the State call someone an independent contractor but we treat them as an officer nevertheless or an employee of someone? We may do it for tax purposes, but we then look at a series of factors to determine whether they're really employees or not. It's hard for you to argue these are employees; correct? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Yes.   We don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They're totally without supervision in their actual debt collection; correct? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, not totally without supervision.   I think that they're supervised by our standards, and they have to -- that's a -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Okay.   But you're not claiming they're employees? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " We're not claiming they're employees. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what other situation have we ever, in any setting, treated someone whom is called an independent contractor, an officer of a company, government agency, anything? This is a novel sort of idea -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " I don't think it's a -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That you as the state say this is an independent contractor, and now, by law, we're going to deem them an officer. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " I just think independent contractor asks -- the independent contractor employee distinction asks a separate question than the officer -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, the problem I have is, I certainly understand officers -- like, with corporations.   With corporations, officers are defined by their charter of incorporation.   These are the officers; these are their responsibilities. It may set an income scale of some sort or tell you which agency within the corporation is going to determine that.   And you have officers of State agencies that are defined by law.   But I don't know that I've ever seen an officer defined by a contract. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, so two points: I think the closest analogy would be -- be a common law analogy that court referenced in Filarsky, which were the special deputy sheriffs.   Filarsky cited treatises treating special deputy sheriffs -- those are sheriffs appointed to undertake the sheriff's duty for a particular task -- as officers within the meaning of resisting of officer statutes. Filarsky relied on that history in determining why the contractors in that case should be entitled to a qualified immunity.   So I think that's the prototypical example. And we're not -- we're not arguing based on the contract.   So the second point would be, if we were -- if all we had was the contract, we wouldn't be here today. For instance, we have collections associations -- they're called third-party vendors -- that we only contract with.   There is no statute.   We do not assert that they are officers or employees covered by this exemption.   They just contract with us to help us with our collection activities. But special counsel are different.   There is a statute, R.C. 109.08, that clearly indicates that just as, historically, sheriffs delegated to special deputies, the attorney general can delegate his sovereign duties to -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I thought that that was just for tax collection.   This is not a tax collection case, is it? I know the attorney general has read it as giving him more power than what it says on its face, but putting that aside, this is not a tax collection.   This is a student debt collection, a consumer debt; correct? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " That's -- that's confusing two points, Your Honor.   The statute -- I disagree with the reading of the statute that suggests we can't use the letterhead elsewhere, but that's the letterhead question.   That's Question 2. On the first question, whether he can appoint special counsel to undertake his task of representing the state when collecting these debts, there's no distinction between tax debts and other types of debts.   He's -- he's -- they -- he can appoint these individuals to collect any type of debt that is certified to him. And it's the appointment that I think is key to make these individuals special counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Murphy, can I ask, when -- when you are trying to fill out what it means for somebody to be an officer, are you looking to the Dictionary Act? Are you looking to the common law? Are you looking to our cases? Are you looking to some combination of the three -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- or how would you prioritize those? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " As -- as Hobby Lobby suggested, I think the starting point when something is undefined is the Dictionary Act.   So I start there, and then -- and then I -- I -- and then you look -- in -- for determining what those words mean in the Dictionary Act, I look to history. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Can I -- can I ask you, then, a question about the Dictionary Act? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Which says an officer \"includes any person authorized by law to perform the duties of the office.\" And my question to you is -- is just which -- what is the office there? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " I would -- I would call it the office of special counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The office of special counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " So just like -- there's no office of -- literally no office of special counsel listed in Ohio law, but there's also no office of solicitor general.   If you look at the Solicitor General Statute for the United States, there's no office -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But we know that office exists. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So -- but -- okay.   So -- so what does a statute have to do, then, to -- to authorize the person to perform the duties of the office? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Usually what the statutes do or what precisely R.C. 109.08 does, it says a superior can appoint -- appoint an inferior officer to engage in certain duties.   Like the SG statute to help the -- assist the attorney general engage in his duties, that's exactly what this statute says. R.C. 109.08 says the attorney general may appoint special counsel to assist in the -- or to represent the State in the collections of these debts. So they say it doesn't even list the duty. I think it lists the precise duty that special counsel are to undertake. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess the question is whether it needs to more authorize an office.   You know? A continuing, permanent thing as opposed to, you know, these officeholders who come and go, and sometimes there are more of them, and sometimes there are fewer of them, and sometimes they deal with X many cases, and sometimes they deal with Y many cases, and it all seems very fluctuating. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " I don't think that matters because, I think, historically, there were plenty of offices that had indefinite numbers.   Today, for instance, assistant U.S. attorneys have indefinite numbers, and they get their duties from their superiors, I think, obviously in the same way. And I still think that the special deputy sheriffs are the best historical example.   And those sheriffs were considered to be officers within the meaning of resisting of officer statutes precisely because they were trying to protect government functions.   And I think that purpose analogy is pretty relevant here as well. The point of this exemption is to protect government operations, and the attorney general has been relying on special counsel to collect these debts since the time of the Great Depression. Special counsel have always been in the attorney general's Office, but debt-collecting duty -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what does your contract require them to comply with the Act? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Because we're also the consumer protection branch office, and we want our people complying with the substantive standards of the Act. For instance, everybody agrees that tax debts are not covered by this Act, but we ask them to comply with the substantive standards of the FDCPA for tax debts.   It's because we think that those are appropriate standards. What we are concerned about are the remedies and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Are the remedies against the State? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, the remedies against special counsel. I think we are concerned -- Filarsky goes through various public policies -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, I'm just talking practical question.   Are you indemnifying? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You're not indemnifying.   They are contractually bound to follow the Act.   And you're, instead, trying to give them immunity for their acts, even though they may have breached.   We can get to that second question in a moment.   Let's assume they breached the Act. Just an assumption.   Don't go crazy. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You want to give them immunity for their contractual violation. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, it would be immunity from the FDCPA.   It wouldn't be immunity from other laws that would apply, for instance -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They're State officers. So what other laws? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, for instance, Section 1983.   I think it's a double-edged sword. By becoming State officers, they become subject to 1983.   So that would apply.   Also State law.   We don't give immunity even to me for reckless conduct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Is there any case that you can point me to where they've been charged with a 1983 violation that you've indemnified them? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, we wouldn't indemnify them in any circumstances, but there is one case that said they were officers within the meaning of 1983.   It was in the Southern District of Ohio -- I'm sorry.   I'm blanking on the name now. But the Sixth Circuit cited it in a footnote. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You mentioned two categories of outside debt collectors for this scheme.   One was this special counsel, for whom you are claiming exemption.   Then you said there is this other category. How was it determined which kind of debt collector the State is going to use, the one that would be subject to the Act and the special counsel who would not? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " You have to remember that these are lawyers.   And how the process works is at JA 124 to 130, and let me just explain it briefly. It starts in-house.   In-house employees of the office will send letters for most debts on our own letterhead in an attempt to collect in-house. When that proves unsuccessful, we go to third-party vendors, which are essentially collections associations which were the historically reason for this Act.   They're not lawyers; they're collections associations.   They send letters and make phone calls.   And that's basically what they do. And that's the second step.   So most debts will go through this entire process, and so they will be contacted by both these collections associations. And then the third step is special counsel, and the reason why special counsel are generally the third step is because that's when litigation becomes a distinct possibility, so you need lawyers. And that's what special counsel are here to do, which is continue -- they continue to send letters, and that's no doubt true, but then they may bring legal options on the table.   They bring thousands of suits, as the two special counsel that are involved in this suit have done. So that's generally how the process works, though -- and we've never -- we've never contested that the collectors associations are officers within the meaning of the Act. And I think that gets back to the point that our position is not -- our position is not that all people collecting debts on behalf of the government are exempt.   Our position is officers are.   And so what does \"officers\" mean? And there I think you should interpret that broadly because the purpose of that is not to interfere with government operations.   And I think this would interfere with our operations in the way the office has long collected the billions of dollars of State debts that it is required via statute to collect. And getting back to the substantive standards, I do think Filarsky has full application here for why it decided qualified immunity was appropriate in the 1983 context.   I think the special counsel and the attorney general staff work closely together, but then special counsel would be the ones left holding the bag because there is no dispute that the attorney general staff are exempt. And so that would pull in the Filarsky point about maybe it will deter the talented individuals from collecting.   Everybody agrees that these are vital government operations.   They are vital to the fiscal health of the State.   And that was a factor that Filarsky relied on. And then I think the third factor that Filarsky relied on was just the distracting nature of damages suits against the States.   And I think this, again, is Exhibit A, because imagine what will happen if this case goes to trial.   It's not just going to involve special counsel.   It will involve our staff who have to respond to discovery and will likely have to testify about how the operations work. So when they're so closely connected in that way, I do think that it makes sense for the exemption to be interpreted with its purposes in mind.   And when you look at the purposes and look at what will happen if this case proceeds, I think that's a good indication that these people are officers, and I think they easily fall within the historical definition of \"officers.\" The special deputy sheriffs, I think, is the most analogous example, and there's plenty of cases that have treated them as officers. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could you tell me what the definition is of \"officer.\" Give me the definition. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What's your definition? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Oh, my definition. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Your definition seems to be tailored to this category.   But tell me how -- what your general definition is. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " So the Dictionary Act, authorized by law to perform the duties of the office.   And unlike collections associations, where there is no authorization for the attorney general to appoint collections associations, there is a law that specifically authorizes us to appoint special counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Does the law not authorize you to hire special -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, just our general ability to contract to perform our services. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how is this different from that? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Because there is a specific statute that express the -- delegates the attorney generals' duty of debt collection to special counsel.   It's analogous to many laws that suggest the way an office position is created is a superior appointing an inferior. The law in Hartwell that created -- there was no office of clerk that -- called the clerk and officer, just said assistant treasurers can appoint the clerk. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " How do you distinguish Germaine, Mr. Murphy? Because that seems a very similar kind of setup to your own.   There is a statute that allows a superior to appoint some people, but those -- those contractors are -- sometimes there are more, sometimes there are fewer. The duties aren't precisely defined, and the court there says that's not an officer notwithstanding the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " So I would distinguish Germaine and several other cases both legally and factually.   So start legally. There is no dispute that Germaine was a constitutional case.   It was interpreted in the meaning of the Appointments Clause, and this Court said that when Congress uses the word \"officer,\" it can easily use it in a broader sense than in the narrower constitutional meaning. The Court said this in Steele when it said that prohibition agents were officers within the meaning of a statute that only allowed officers to execute search warrants.   And it said this in Lamar when it said Congress were officers.   So the Court has repeatedly said that Congress can use the word \"officer\" in a way -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So that's to say that we take these cases, whether it's Germaine or, or your side, Hartwell, and we put them in a different box? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Exactly.   We always caveated Hartwell by saying it was a constitutional officer basis.   But, if they are a constitutional officer, I think by definition you should think that they are a statutory Officer. And, factually, I do think that the surgeon in Germaine was much more like the -- the surgeon in Germaine was more like the collection association than the special counsel themselves, and let me explain why. In Germaine the relevant office was the office of pension commissioners, and his job was to dole out pensions to appropriate parties.   And so that was the official duty.   And the surgeon, all he did was assist in helping with the duty. But when somebody else has actually delegated that duty, like a tax collector delegates to a deputy collector of customs, the delegation of the duty, it makes all the distinction in the world. And Auffmordt is on the same basis.   It was a merchant appraiser.   And the merchant appraiser was held not to be an officer in the customs office because they weren't actually going out and collecting the relevant customs; they were just helping the collector of customs. But Steele also makes quite clear that deputy collectors of customs would be officers because that's a situation where the superior officer is actually delegating his authority to the inferior officer there, the deputy.   And I think that's the symmetry that matters here. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That seems -- if I understood you correctly, that seems an odd line to draw.   It's the difference between delegating all of your authority and delegating part of your authority? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " No.   What is the authority? The authority of the attorney general's office and the authority of the tax collector is to represent the State in the court and to bind the State and to bind the third party in the court.   Collections associations cannot do that.   Special counsel absolutely do that.   That's their main job. So just as -- for instance, assistant U.S. attorneys would be consider officers because when they stand up in court, they are representing the United States because the statute allows the AG to delegate those official duties to the deputy. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Could you, Mr. Murphy, address the point, whether this is misleading? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Sure.   I'll start at a high level and then get into the specifics. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " In the course of that, the statute says that you cannot falsely represent a document to be issued by.   And if you could address that part of it. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Sure.   I will start there. We think this is issued by the attorney general's office when special counsel send a letter. The official meaning of \"issue\" is to distribute in an official capacity.   When they send these letters, they are distributing them in their official capacity as special counsel to the attorney general. So it's fully appropriate for the office to be listed at the top in those circumstances. I would draw, I guess, the analogy to clerk -- or courts.   Courts issue subpoenas all the time through private attorneys nowadays, that the clerk of the court doesn't actually sign the subpoena anymore, but it has the name of the court at the top, and a private attorney is authorized to issue that subpoena. So I think that analogy is -- this case is an easier case, it seems to me, because special counsel have a strong relationship to the attorney general's office.   But the very fact that a private attorney can issue a contract subpoena suggests that entities can issue things through people other than independent contract -- or other than employees. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What about the other provision that is allegedly violated, the one that proscribes use of any business or organization's name other than the true name of the debt collector's business or organization? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " It's essentially the same logic.   This strikes me as their true name when they are special counsel to the attorney general.   The attorney general is their true name.   It's their true name because it distinguishes them when they're acting as special counsel for the attorney general and when they're acting as private counsel for some private creditor. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " When they signed their name at the bottom and gave their law firm name, was that necessary? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " It was.   As a technical matter, it's necessary because the money gets sent to them, so they have to -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Necessary for compliance with the Act? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Oh.   I mean, it clarifies the relationship even more.   It might be perhaps a closer question if they hadn't, but if they had just said special counsel, I would say, as a technical matter, it's necessary because how it works is when special counsel are assigned cases and individuals send them checks, they send them to their address. So we kind of have to. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What about only -- the recipient would think, at the least, the letter was authorized by the attorney general? What the statute says is special counsel can use the letterhead stationery only in connection with tax collection.   Doesn't it? It says -- here it says, \"The special counsels use the letterhead stationery, but only in connection with such claims arising out of those taxes.\" This isn't a tax.   So he gets the letter, and he thinks, maybe at least the letter is an authorized letter.   But it isn't an authorized letter because the statute says you can't authorize him to do it. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " We disagree with that view of the statute.   We think the statute says -- the first part of the statute says they shall use this letterhead, and the second says \"but only in.\" We interpret that statute -- not just this attorney general but several other attorney generals have interpreted this statute only to require it in those tax contexts and to leave it to the attorney general in other context.   And they haven't challenged that.   At JA 114 to 115, they categorically deny it. And I think this turns a virtue into a vice, by the way.   When they put our letterhead on there, it shows to consumers that they can actually call with concerns if they have concerns with special counsel or if they have concern with the debts. But if there is no further questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosencranz. "}, {"speaker": "E. Joshua Rosenkranz", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Your Honors, both questions presented really revolve around a single point: Private debt collectors retained as independent counsel for or by a State attorney general are not State officers.   They are not the attorney general.   They are not from his office.   And they cannot legally hold themselves as being from his office. When the consumer sees letterhead that says \"Office of the Attorney General,\" she thinks the letter comes from within that office, not from a professional debt collector with a personal financial stake in the outcome of the ensuing conversation. Congress saw the distinction.   And as two of the questions from the Court suggested from Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, the Act is actually built around this fundamental distinction. It's in the overarching definition of \"debt collector,\" which defines the Act's coverage as \"any person who regularly collects debts owed another.\" And then it's in each of the two provisions that have gotten a lot of focus from General Murfree's argument this morning, the two provisions that provide carve-outs.   One says that the Act does not cover any officer or employee of a private business; the other says the Act doesn't cover any officer or employee of a State. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " If I could clarify, there may be two separate questions that may be part of your answer.   But are these officers under State law -- whether they are under the debt collection Act or not is a separate question.   Is it right that they're properly considered officers under State law because that is how the attorney general has designated them and views them? "}, {"speaker": "E. Joshua Rosenkranz", "text": " Absolutely not, Your Honor.   Ohio law is the same as the law that's codified in the Dictionary Act.   It's the same law that this Court has adopted in Metcalf.   There has to be a permanent and continuing position.   It has to be duties that are created by law, not -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " That's not true with respect to qualified immunity.   There doesn't have to be a permanent -- I'm sorry.   What was the other adjective? Permanent and what? "}, {"speaker": "E. Joshua Rosenkranz", "text": " Permanent and continuing office. Yes, Your Honor, you are exactly right. Filarsky is a qualified immunity case.   Filarsky did not conclude that the person who got qualified immunity were officers.   It concluded that they got qualified immunity even though they were not officers, just like in common law. Common law provided the posse comitatus -- you know, the posses who were deputized -- qualified immunity even though they were not officers.   And this goes back to whether we're talking about the Dictionary Act definition or the definition of common law. Collections special counsel are simply not Officers even by designation of the attorney general.   I mean, the attorney general has done everything humanly possible to divorce these individuals from the State. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But they authorized it -- I'm sorry.   Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I think you have recognized -- tell me if I'm wrong about this -- that the special counsel could send out a dunning letter, and the first sentence says, in boldface, \"We write to you as special counsel to the attorney general who has authorized us to collect a debt you owe to X government agency.\" That would be perfectly all right.   No attorney general letterhead, but that opening sentence would be okay.   \"We have been authorized by the attorney general to collect a debt you owe to a State agency.\" No problem with that. "}, {"speaker": "E. Joshua Rosenkranz", "text": " That's correct, Your Honor. So just to be clear, we're shifting ground now to point 2 which is about whether it's a violation of the statute.

The FDCPA applies to Ohio's debt collection special counsel because outside the context of this litigation, Ohio has chosen not to treat them as officers or employees of the State.   There has been some discussion in the top half about Ohio Code Section 109.08.   Excuse me.   General Murfree has conceded that that does not create an office of special counsel. Just as a side note, the Office of U.S. Solicitor General is described and duties are given in the Code of Federal Regulation.   There is no similar set of regulations that would create an office of special counsel here. But even if you were to assume, for the sake of argument, that the statute -- I'm sorry -- authorized the attorney general to create an office of special counsel and to treat the people that hired as special counsel as officers, that is not done so here. In the retention agreement, the attorney general has been careful to say that these people are not to be considered employees of the State for any purpose.   The agreement not only does not indemnify the special counsel; it requires the special counsel to indemnify the State.   It doesn't give them any rights to collect any debts.   It gives the attorney general complete discretion over what debts the special counsel may collect. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

But it also intended to allow creditors, whether private or public, to use their own in-house people without being subject to the requirements of the Act. And so it's really totally up to the State. If it's going to use its inside people, then it doesn't have to comply with the FDCPA.   But when it hires outside third-party contractors, it does. If I could just address what Justice Breyer was asking about, the use of your true name, I think if you filled out a form that asked for your name and then said, \"Have you used any other name?\" you would take that to mean as your own name.

Harrington", "text": " It would, because it would still give the impression that it was issued by the office of the attorney general.   And if it's sent by the third-party outside debt collector, then it's not issued by the office of the attorney -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Even though it's approved -- suppose that they -- they take it to General DeWine, and they say, General, I would like to send this.   Am I authorized to send it? He says, yes, that's fine.   That's still misleading? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Yes, because in section -- Section 9, it talks about authorized, issued, or approved by a State agency.   And so if you give the misimpression as to any one of those things, then it's a per se violation of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It's your -- it's your position -- it's the position of the government of the United States that the Attorney General of Ohio is in violation of this law? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " No, that the special counsel are in violation -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " No.   But he's approved it. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " He's -- he has sanctioned a violation of the law.   But I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But under your position, the -- the attorney general of the State of Ohio is in violation of the law.   That's the position of the United States that you're arguing in this court? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " No, sir.   Our -- may I answer? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Our view is that the attorney general has authorized the special counsel to do something that is a violation of the law.   He has not himself -- he is not subject to the law, so he has not himself violated the law. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, the next time you come here in a criminal or a civil case and someone has authorized something, I will remind you of your answer. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Murphy, you have four minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points. First, going to Justice Kagan's question, I really think they are turning a virtue into a vice here.   They're flipping the Act on its head.   If you -- if you look at the tax statute that requires the AG to give this letterhead to special counsel for tax debts, the very next provision -- the very next provision of that Act, which was known as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, the very next provision of that Act requires the AG to appoint problem resolution officers to handle complaints by debtors about special counsel or the employee assigned to the case. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How do they know who to call? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Precisely because the AG's letterhead -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Does the Act say that the special debt collector has to give them the AG's problem-solving -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " No.   But I think that -- that was the point of the law, was to put the letterhead, so they know to call the office.   And then we have the regular customer service hotline that they can call and they'll -- they'll get -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But that's quite interesting, because the only number that's in these letters is the net -- number of the debt collector. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, that's right.   But by putting the letterhead on the -- on -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Is there any obligation in the contract for the debt collector, when he receives a customer complaint, to give them the number of the AG's customer service -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " There's not an obligation in the contract, but there certainly is an obligation in the contract for them to report that complaint to the AG. And I -- I -- I think that the AG has interpreted these problem resolution officers more broadly to allow it to handle all sorts of complaints.   But I think the reputational idea is also significant, because when the AG authorizes these individuals to use the letterhead, that's a powerful incentive on the AG or the AG's office -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It also uses the word \"issued.\" And so what about \"issued\"? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " Well, I think that -- just look at the -- we're the only party that has actually cited the dictionary definition of \"issue.\" And the dictionary definition of \"issue\" is to distribute in their official capacity. So when special counsel send these letters, they are distributing it in their official capacity as special counsel to the attorney general, not as private lawyers with their private law firms.   I think that's an easy interpretation of \"issue\" that would authorize the -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But if we get to the second question, we've already decided that these people are not officers.   They're independent contractors. They might be agents in a casual sense of the word, but they're not officers. "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " That's absolutely correct. Our first-level answer would be that they are -- should be -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   So if we assume that they're not officers, then I think Justice Breyer's question holds: What does it mean for that person to issue something as opposed to the Ohio -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " I do think that you -- I do think that they're distributing it in their official capacity as special counsel.   Whether they're independent contractors, officers, or employees, I think that's a separate question. And then I think it goes to the clear statement rule with respect to Justice Kennedy's comment.   I think it's just a fundamental breach of etiquette, or of federalism, to suggest that private parties are the ones who get to decide who gets to use an attorney general's letterhead. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " May I ask you -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I think that question should be with the attorney general. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's fine.   But as far as I see it, isn't there one of these two cases where someone who wasn't the special counsel signed the letter? "}, {"speaker": "Eric E. Murphy", "text": " That's absolutely true.   But they've waived that argument because their theory of the case is that it's just the letterhead that's misleading.   And I can easily -- I can get into the facts of that issue. That issue was this person got a call from the person -- from the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff asked for her balance.   She sent the balance on the letter.   It says, per your request, here is your balance, and then the Plaintiff turned around and sued the individual after they requested for the letter. So I think they've largely abandoned that idea that the letterhead was misleading. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted. "}]
