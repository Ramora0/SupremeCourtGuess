[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 16-1144, Marinello versus United States. Mr. Hellman. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress made it a felony to obstruct the due administration of the tax code, it was not creating an all-purpose tax crime; it was borrowing from a statute that prohibited the obstruction of a pending proceeding. This Court normally presumes that borrowed language carries its meaning with it. And that has to be the case here, for without that limitation, obstruction would swallow up the other crimes that Congress simultaneously enacted and, in particular, it would obliterate the careful line that Congress drew between misdemeanors and felonies. Indeed, the government's interpretation is so broad that it would chill entirely legitimate conduct that Congress never intended to penalize. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What -- what -- what lawful conduct would the government's reading put at risk? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Certainly.   There's a whole range because obstruction, on their definition, is so broad.   For example, you could imagine a situation -- I'll take an everyday taxpayer, someone who pays their gardener, say, in cash, which is one of the predicate acts in this case as well.   Paying in cash isn't necessarily illegal under the tax laws, but the test that the government would have is, by paying someone in cash, you're -- you're making it harder for the IRS to assess perhaps your tax liability or perhaps the tax liability of the person that you are paying. And at that question -- at that point, the only question that remains is mens rea, why did you do it? Did you do it for the purpose of obtaining an unlawful benefit? And even -- that benefit need not even be your own under the government's reading; it could be the benefit of the gardener. Or to take another example, imagine a taxpayer who says I'm going to keep every document the law requires under the code.   I'll keep every document but no documents more.   If the IRS ever came back and looked at that person's tax position, they might say your failure to keep these documents that -- that aren't otherwise required hindered us in our ability to assess your taxes. At that point, again, the only question becomes the why, the mens rea.   And with a felony prosecution on the line and with so many acts, the actus reus being so broad, anything that hinders the IRS's ability to carry out a code, obstructs -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " My problem is that I have -- a second question. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I have a lot of hypotheticals under your definition of what this section means that wouldn't be covered. So how about if an individual knows that the IRS is in the presence of -- press -- in the process of assessing his taxes and he in some way obstructs that process, or an agent -- the agent in 2004 called the defendant and said: You know, I'm deciding whether to open an investigation.   I haven't, but I'm just thinking about it.   I understand you have this business, and I don't see any tax returns. And your client answered the way he first did: I make less than $1,000.   I don't have to file.   And the agent closes the investigation -- closes the file and says: I'm not going to investigate this. Under your theory, that direct obstruction would not be actionable? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " It would be several other crimes.   As -- as you describe it, it sounds like tax evasion, if there's a deficiency and an evasive act in connection with it.   It could be a false statement to the IRS.   But Congress knows how to write a pending proceeding requirement. If you think back to the statute at issue in Arthur Andersen, Section 1512, another obstruction statute that applies in cases of corruption to proceedings, that 1512(f), which Congress enacted as part of Sarbanes-Oxley, says the proceeding need not be pending or even about to be instituted. Now, this Court -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, wait a minute, yes, it can do that sometimes. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " It can do that. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It doesn't other times. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " It doesn't other times. And -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So is this one of those other times? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Well, I think the -- the right way to understand it is Congress is -- the \"need not be pending\" language was a product of a 1980s revision to the statute and really started to apply to documents in Sarbanes-Oxley. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Do you think the word \"administration\" -- \"due administration of this title,\" does any work in the interpretation? It seems to me that one could say that the example I gave is an actual affirmative act by the agency.   It is -- the agent is calling and doing his work under the Act but that what you do outside of interacting directly with the agency is more omission, which is not the administration of the Act. Could that line be drawn? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " I don't -- that's certainly not the line the government is offering, but -- but -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's not the line the government's offering -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Is offering. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- but yours is -- your broadness is sweeping up a lot of conduct that I think could be perceived as active obstruction of the work of -- the direct work of the agency.   An agent calls you and you mislead them. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Well, a couple responses.   As I said, those are covered by other crimes in the statute, false statements. Could even be covered by the officers clause of this statute.   But I think that the key for this is, in some sense, and I think the point of your question is, not paying your taxes, failing to file a return, failure to make a payment, we would concede is in some sense obstruction of the administration of the code, but that can't be what Congress had in mind for this statute because we know what they thought the penalty for those crimes should be.   They should be a misdemeanor.   Those people should not be branded as felons.   It's wrong, it's a crime, but it's a misdemeanor punishable by one year. And, you know, essentially, on one page of the code, they're calling this conduct a misdemeanor.   And then, on the government's view, actually, it turns out that -- it turns out to be felony obstruction.   And these are provisions that were the product of an intense, multi-year process of reforming the tax code, where Congress specifically debated back and forth between the House and the Senate about whether some of these crimes should be classified as misdemeanors or felonies. And so I think when you're trying to read a statute as a whole -- and here the need to do that is at its apex because we're not talking about different provisions that were enacted over a series of decades.   This was Congress's concerted attempt to codify and calibrate the penalties that it wanted. And then to find out that actually everything turns out to be a felony because in every -- any act that violates a tax law could in some sense be meant -- understood to be obstructing the administration of the code, that's not a plausible way to read a statute.

You can go online and just look for where those charges have been brought, even in reported cases. And as we discuss in the brief, the predicates are -- are now becoming ones in which failure to file a return is becoming a predicate, failure to pay taxes is becoming a predicate.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, Mr. Hellman, I -- I mean, I share the -- your -- your concern that if this statute is read in its broadest possible literal sense, it has a really staggering sweep, but I wonder if your interpretation really solves the problem because can't the same sorts of things happen after a proceeding has commenced? Let's say somebody is being audited and eventually the person comes up with the records that the auditor needs, but they're all scrambled up, and it looks like -- and -- and the person is -- is late in providing them and misses meetings and just is very difficult. You could get the same situation there, couldn't you? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " I suppose you could, but there's a difference as to why I think the statute ought to tolerate prosecution in that scenario, which is where there's been a formal notice of audit and someone has been given questions by the government and needs to respond in a reasonable manner to them. You can understand why Congress wanted to make that a crime distinct from, maybe on top of, other crimes that a person has committed.   But if we're talking about the maintenance of records prior to the initiation of that proceeding, then there are many other crimes that do cover recordkeeping and, of course, your obligation to pay taxes. But those are generally, with the exception of tax evasion, generally not felonies and they generally have a lower sentence than the one here. So I do take your point that there could be the potential for abuse, even under our interpretation, but I do think that it's significantly narrowed just for the reasons that I said. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Hellman, there are obvious reasons to search for a limiting interpretation here. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess the question is why your limiting interpretation? And obviously you talked about this in your brief. But I just want to give you an opportunity now to try to convince me, because right now I feel as though it comes out of thin air.   It doesn't have any grounding in the text of the statute. And I guess I'm not seeing quite how the precedent gets you there.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Absolutely.   I think the -- the key reasons why we would think that Congress had 1503 in mind when it was talking -- when it was enacting 7212 are the following: You've got a statute, 1503, enacted just a few years before, six years before.   It doesn't just talk about obstruction of the due administration of something. It's got that two-part structure with officers in the first half, administration in the second.   It's got those same verbs, to impede or intimidate the officer, or impede or obstruct the proceeding. And you also have the same means by which you're doing it.   So you put that all together and, on top of that, the fact that there's nothing unusual about obstruction proceed -- obstruction statutes having proceedings as their focus. There are several obstruction statutes after 1503 in the code that all talk about obstruction of proceedings. So -- so, when you talk about obstruction of the due administration, it's sort of a natural marriage of that concept to proceedings. Now, there's no legislative history that speaks to this one way or the other.   We certainly concede that. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But wasn't there the predecessor of 1503? It was oriented toward courts. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " It -- it was expressly -- said, obstruction in a court, in effect, that's correct.   But when Congress recodified that statute six years before 7212, they said that they were not making any substantive changes. So that was the language on the shelf, if you wanted to have a two-part obstruction statute: one for the officers, one for the due administration. It's really the model.   And I don't think that word choice can be explained by -- by coincidence.   And then, of course, you have the problem of, again, what would -- the government's alternative interpretation puts a code that would stretch across this, you know, this entire table, any violation of it, which is potentially a felony. If I would, I wanted to go back to one other way in which -- and this is not just an omissions point, this is an affirmative acts point -- 7205 in the tax code. If anybody's ever been an employee in this country, when you start your job, you fill out the W-4 form where you say how many dependents you have, which controls how much withholding your employer will take out of your -- your paycheck. I, too, know many people who don't put down the true number of dependents that they have in order to affect the withholding that they get.   In some sense, that is an unlawful benefit.   Money's being -- not being withheld that should be.   But we know that Congress wanted to punish that as a misdemeanor, not a felony. Now -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You think a lot of people do that? I mean, you've got three children and they say they've got five? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " In my experience -- well, in any case -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, your experience because -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " -- experience -- I -- I was responding to Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I mean, people who get caught come to you.   So, in your experience, you see a lot of them. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Right.   There may be a category problem there.   I -- I agree. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Yeah, there are people who list their dogs as dependents. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Well, I'll defer to Justice Ginsburg on that. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I wasn't thinking of those people.   I just think that there are many, many, many, many regulations in the code that are -- seem to be quite trivial to an ordinary person.   And they might, in fact, not pay that much attention to every form and, moreover, maybe they even want to help the gardener.   All right? Now, I think there are many such people in the 1099 case, but I don't know. That's why I asked you whether it was an appropriate example. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " And I do believe that it is one. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, Mr. Hellman, what role should lenity play here, if any? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Well, I think this Court's decisions in Aguilar and Arthur Andersen sort of point the way in that direction. We haven't made a constitutional argument in this case that it would be unlawful, unconstitutional for Congress to write a statute, the statute that the government says they wrote here.   But -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Saving that for the next case. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " We'll save that for the next case.   But what we have most definitely argued in this case is that, as the Court explained in Aguilar, before this Court will assume that Congress meant to felonize every immoral act under the sun, we're going to want them to say that a little bit more clearly than they -- than they did in the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But how did they in Aguilar? I mean, I took -- I read the language in Aguilar and I thought it was very helpful to your case.   The statute's identical -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- virtually, except administration of justice instead of administration of this title. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And then it's quite limited how they interpreted it.   But I -- I'm not totally clear as to what significance -- they said something about a nexus -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- but a nexus to what? I mean, and -- and -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- what's your understanding of that? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " So, as I read Aguilar, it's a nexus to a pending proceeding.   So, in that case, the defendant lied, that was conceded to an FBI agent, but it wasn't clear that those statements were ever going to get into court into a grand jury proceeding.   They might or might not in the words of the Court. And what the court -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So your argument is nexus to a pending proceeding, interpreted with the same language except it says administration of justice should lead us to say nexus to a pending proceeding in a statute that's identical, but the words are administration of this title. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Is that the argument? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " That is. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " And, again, to respond to Justice Gorsuch's question, the Court has proceeded carefully with lenity in mind when it -- when it's looked at a statute that the government has said covers everything that one might want to punish, but doesn't clearly say that that is what we intend to punish, and both considerations of fair notice and, as the Court put it, deference to the prerogatives of Congress suggests that a more narrow interpretation is called for. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, is that what lenity means? This -- for sure this is a broad statute. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It doesn't seem very ambiguous.   You know, lenity, usually we're looking for a grievous ambiguity, sort of like the last case where it's like, I don't know, you could read it this way, you could read it that way.   What do we do? But that's not this statute.   This statute, taken on its face, is just ungodly broad. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " I understand the Court's lenity doctrine to say that once you apply the normal tools of statutory interpretation, if you're really left with good arguments on both sides, there's real ambiguity, important ambiguity. In a criminal case, you go with the less harsh interpretation.   And I do -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So -- so, for example, if we are left with some ambiguity as to your Aguilar analogy, that's when you would suggest perhaps lenity might be a tiebreaker? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Yes -- yes, I do.   And -- and with respect to Justice Kagan's question, I think that these words read in isolation do suggest breadth.   But reading them in isolation isn't the -- the only step obviously of statutory interpretation. We have to look at it in context.   And this is an incredibly strong case where context ought to matter, where you have Congress intentionally trying to bring together in one place, I believe is the phrase they used, all of the disparate tax crimes and recalibrate them as they saw fit. So, again, the statute, read in isolation, I certainly take the point that it -- it looks broad and strong and \"ungodly broad,\" to use your phrase, but that isn't the end of the statutory analysis.   And once you do all of the steps -- you look to where the language comes from, you look to what it might mean in context with other provisions right next door to it -- at that point, we suggest -- we think we have the better of the argument, but at a minimum, at a bare minimum, there are competing interpretations that -- where the rule of lenity might apply. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There -- there is something to be done about the context that this was drafted in.   As I look at the first half of this statute -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Yes.

Hellman", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- a affirmative act and an omission act because that doesn't have the flavor of force or threat of force or threatening, all of the sort of active, violent or active, obstructive -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- behavior that the examples set forth. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " I think I understand your question better now.   And I have a couple of responses. I don't think the omission limitation will get -- will make sense of the tax criminal code for a couple of reasons.   One, there are several misdemeanor offenses under the code that are not omission offenses; they are affirmative act offenses.   And Congress showed a lot of thought: Making a false statement in connection with your taxes -- that's an affirmative act -- is a misdemeanor unless you -- unless you make that statement under the penalty of perjury.   That is the difference between Section 7207 and Section 7206, subsection (1). That distinction between bad kinds of false statements, affirmative acts, is obviated, obliterated, by an interpretation of obstruction that says, when you make a false statement to the government, it has the effect of hindering, even if you didn't make it under the penalty of perjury.   You might have made it not in that connection. So I don't think that an omissions-based approach makes -- you know, gets -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, does it get us part of the way there, though?

And could that same spirit or thought be thought to apply in the administration as well, that the IRS has to be doing something? Your preceding thought is a -- is a doing, it is a thing; it is not just merely -- I think the IRS speaks of the pervasive, continuous, brooding omnipresence of -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Yes.   Right. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- of tax liabilities, that there's an implication from the officers clause that there's something more going on.   Am I -- maybe that's not entirely helpful. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Well, what I would say is if -- if the thought is by limiting obstruction to any affirmative act that hinders the IRS in any way, you have not brought the statute -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " No, no, no.   No, no, limiting it to some affirmative act going on by the agency, I think, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, that the agency has to be doing something other than merely passively receiving taxes. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Well, and, of course, all of the conduct or omissions in this case are not in that context. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " It's -- it's a friendly amendment. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Then that's not the rule we have adopted or endorsed to the Court, but -- and, again, you would have some other -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I have difficulty getting to what you have -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S.

So -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " The government made some similar arguments in the honest services case, that everything can be cured by a mens rea requirement.   We don't need to worry about actus reus.   We'll tell you about the actus reus when we get there.   We'll create a common law of honest services. And here it seems to me that's what the government's parallel -- parallel argument, that we're not going to tell you what qualifies.   We'll find out later. And sometimes it's going to be simply paying cash.   Sometimes it's not going to be keeping records.   And -- and I just wonder are we going to wind up in the same place, that you drive this thing to such enormous breadth in its interpretation that you're -- you're inviting a vagueness challenge at the back end? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Parker", "text": " I -- I disagree with that, Justice Gorsuch, and I'd like to just take a moment to explain why. So there are a number of limiting features of this statute that provide protection against precisely what you are explaining.   And I think there are really three of them. The first is there has to be a natural tendency to obstruct.   This is the objective factual nexus that Aguilar says is baked into the term \"endeavor.\" There's at least that.

Those things do not have a natural tendency to obstruct in and of themselves because there is nothing that says that the administration of the code has to be made maximally easy. The only reason that those would end up having a -- an obstructive effect is if you pair them with efforts to mislead or deceive the IRS into believing that the situation is not as it appears for an unlawful advantage. So in the -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, where does this come from in the language of the statute? I mean, this -- that's what troubles me about this.   If I read \"impede\" to mean what it means in ordinary language, slow the progress of, you don't even have to impede.   It's enough that you endeavor to impede. The only limiting thing I see here is \"corruptly.\" And, you know, the old, you know, the old saying, it's lawful for taxpayers to avoid taxes but not to evade taxes.   So the line is -- the line can be very -- can be very thin. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Parker", "text": " I'm not sure actually that it is all that thin.

If you look at the elements of Section 7212, they are different than the elements that you will find in any other criminal provision in the -- in the Internal Revenue Code. They require corruption.

Breyer", "text": " -- if you want, I want this answer.   I don't want to interrupt your answer, but I want you to augment it. And you started to do that when you started to talk about just what you were talking about.   Look, if I put it differently, three principles: One, the Chief Justice, I think, enunciated, and I -- it sounds comical if I'm going to say it, but -- but it's very important; it is not an appropriate way of interpreting a statute. Look, perfect criminal statute, it is a crime to do wrong in the opinion of the attorney general.   Don't worry, we'll interpret it properly. Even if you do interpret it properly, no.   The answer under the Constitution, I think, is no. The second principle is right here in Aguilar, both of them, the second and third. \"We have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogative of Congress and out of concern that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand of what the law will do, if a certain line is passed.\" From those principles, they conclude that a statute identically worded to this one but for the word justice instead of title requires a nexus be shown to a specific grand jury or jury proceeding, a -- a court proceeding, even though, of course, you can read the word justice to include the investigators and many other things. All right.   They're saying, in effect, you take those same principles, that same limiting restriction, and do the same analogous thing here. Now, why not? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Parker", "text": " I think there are a number of reasons not to do that.   First of all, I think that the -- as I just explained, the due administration of justice has always been understood to be something that occurs in discrete proceedings, unlike the administration of the Internal Revenue Code; but I think that that is confirmed by the history of Section 1503. The predecessor statute to Section 1503 specifically said that it only applied to the obstruction of officers or witnesses in any court of the United States or the due administration of justice therein. Now, when Congress recodified that provision in 1948, it modified the wording, but as this Court has repeatedly explained, that 1948 recodification was not intended to have any substantive effect on any of the provisions in the code. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But Congress legislates against the backdrop of what's out there.   And what -- what was out there was our interpretation of those words requiring a nexus to an active proceeding, something more than -- something more definite than something that's continuous, ubiquitous and universal. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Parker", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And -- and the Congress that passed this statute had that interpretation in its back pocket at the time; right? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Parker", "text": " Well, I -- but I would disagree with that because in none of this Court's cases, in Pettibone, in Aguilar, Arthur Andersen, any of them did this Court ever suggest that it is the phrase \"due administration,\" not the phrase \"due administration of justice,\" that carries that connotation. And I would also note that if that is, in fact, what Congress intended, it is very strange because Congress had just a few years earlier enacted the statute that is now Section 1505, cited in our brief. And that statute was specifically enacted to do exactly what -- what you're suggesting, Justice Gorsuch.   It was enacted to extend the provisions of Section 1503 to pending proceedings before agencies of the United States.   And that is what it says. If the Petitioner's interpretation were correct, then I think that there's really no reason for Congress to have enacted that, and it would also be awfully strange for Congress not to have borrowed that language. But I would also note that there are a number of -- as I -- getting back to the point I was making previously, there is no reason to adopt his particular limiting construction, which, frankly, I think has no basis in the text, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. -- Mr. Parker -- "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Parker", "text": " -- does not solve these problems. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Can -- can I go back to the question of -- of -- of the Department's prosecution policy? And, you know I -- could you tell me, number 1, what the current state of the Department's guidance is as to whether prosecutors are -- are told to prosecute to the maximum extent allowed by law; and, number 2, whether that would mean in this case that here I am a prosecutor and I think that some action falls within 7212, that I would be precluded from proceeding instead under 7203 or 7205 or 7207. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Parker", "text": " My understanding is it is certainly the Department's position as a general matter that prosecutors should be charging the most serious offense that is readily provable on those facts. I -- I -- I couldn't say whether in any given case that would mean that Section 7212 would have to be charged because, as I said before, the facts of each case are going to be different and they're going to make the ability to prove Section 7212 more or less possible.

I'm not sure why the government would want to tack one on to the other.

Parker", "text": " Well, because I think we would simply proceed under Section 7212(a), because that is the -- carries the higher potential penalty. I -- I would like to, in -- in the time I have remaining, just be sure to make two points. The first is the Petitioner's proposed limiting construction, as we've said, it doesn't come -- it doesn't have a basis in the text, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other potential limiting constructions that this Court could adopt, either in this case or in another appropriate case. I think, Justice Sotomayor, you alluded to the possibility of excluding pure omissions from -- from the scope of the statute to try to differentiate between the misdemeanor provisions and this one. The Court actually engaged in a very similar analysis in Spies.   That was the tax evasion case where it determined that omissions, pure omissions at least, would not qualify. And I think that that may be an appropriate limiting construction here.   No one has suggested that.   And I think the reason Petitioner hasn't is because it wouldn't really help him. The only two means of the endeavor in this case that were charged as failures to act, if you look at the evidence, it was clear that he was engaged in clear affirmative actions of destroying his records and other things.   So that's one point I'd like to make. And the second is one of the main problems here is that obstruction will -- obstruction at the front end will often prevent the government from being able to charge appropriate offenses on the back end.   And this case demonstrates that perfectly. The government would have brought a tax evasion charge in this case but for the fact that Mr. Marinello so destroyed his records that it was unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an actual tax deficiency. And so what I think Petitioner's proposed construction would do is it would effectively allow individuals to evade their taxes and then obstruct their way down to a misdemeanor charge, or if they are particularly good at it, maybe obstruct their way out of criminal penalties at all. And the government could do nothing about it, unless the individual actually happened to be obstructing a pending audit or investigation. Audits and investigations are types of administration, but the Internal Revenue Code contains an entire subtitle called \"Procedure and Administration\" that lists in sequential chapters all of the different types of administration that occur. That includes the gathering of information that taxpayers must self-report. It includes the calculation and assessment of taxes, the collection of taxes. It would be very strange, I think, for Congress to have specified that with such -- with such clarity and then to have intended by referencing the due administration of this title to cut out all of that administrative functions and only focus on audits and investigations. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You gave the example of the omission that Justice Sotomayor brought up.   What else could limit the potentially huge scope of this provision? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Parker", "text": " Well, I think that -- I mean, I -- I don't mean to repeat myself, but I do think, Justice Ginsburg, that a rigorous enforcement of the mens rea requirement does that. And this Court has repeatedly said that in the obstruction context, rigorous enforcement of mens rea requirements is what separates individuals who do not have or have not committed culpable conduct from those who do. And I don't think that this obstruction provision -- may I conclude? I don't think this obstruction provision should be treated any differently. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hellman, four minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Just a few quick points. I want to begin with the misdemeanors, the willful misdemeanors in the code.   I think I heard my friend on the other side suggest that it could very well be that a highly substantial number of those misdemeanors would qualify as obstruction, which is in itself a problem. And, again, it requires this Court to think that the crimes that the Congress made the centerpiece of the code, these willful offenses, really are only meant for the idiosyncratic case in which somebody intentionally violates the law but not for any particular benefit. In the context of willful tax violations, I think in the substantial majority of cases, if not all, you're going to have a prosecutor who can say this was done for a reason, some unlawful benefit, which need not even be financial. Second, as to the safeguards that the mens rea requirement offers, in a world in which not consulting fully with an accountant, paying in cash, not keeping all records, can become obstruction, if they're done for the wrong reason, then you really are leaving it up to the prosecutor, who is required under current charging rules to charge as aggressively as possible, to decide what was in the defendant's mind. Not every case goes to trial.   Very few cases go to trial.   With a felony conviction in the balance, you're going to find that this gives enormous leverage, even more so than they currently have, to prosecutors. Third, there's a suggestion here that the government needs this broad interpretation; otherwise, wrongdoing will go unpunished. They can't point to a single case since 1954 where that was the case.   It is certainly not the case here, where the government told the jury repeatedly that Mr. Marinello had substantial gross income and took substantial personal income from that. Exhibits 21 and 22 below and pages 516 to 518 make that point very clearly. Fourth, the omissions theory as an alternative way of limiting this.   Again, that doesn't make sense of the statutes that are misdemeanors, like forcible rescue, like willful false statements, that are affirmative acts but less punishment than the -- than the 7212 obstruction charge. The last thing I want to say is we believe that based on the heritage of this language and the fact that obstruction statutes typically are focused on proceedings, that is the interpretation we've offered to the Court. But as Justice Gorsuch and Justice Sotomayor pointed out, there are other ways of reading the officers clause in conjunction with the administration clause to come up with a more limited standard that does not cover any of the context -- conduct in this case, act or omission. So, for those reasons, we would ask the Court to reverse. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So, what is it? What do you derive from the officer clause? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " I -- I'm sorry? "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What -- what is the limit that you are now proposing? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " The limit that I am understanding Justice Sotomayor and Justice Gorsuch to be suggesting is, if you are -- if your obstructive act or omission is in the context with some interaction with the IRS, not, say, failing to talk to an accountant on your own time, not paying someone in cash in your own home, but in some interaction with the IRS, that could be a limitation; that would limit it. I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " An -- an interaction, although no audit, no proceeding is yet under way? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S.
