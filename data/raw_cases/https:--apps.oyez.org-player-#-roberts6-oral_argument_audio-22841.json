The medical residents at Petitioner's schools are enrolled and pursuing a formal accredited curriculum that has a rigorous core curriculum, as I said.   Hundreds of classes, conferences, lectures, laboratory research, written exams, grades, and intensive, hands-on clinical patient training under the supervision of faculty members.

I am aware of no program that involves residency and resident programs accredited by the ACGME that does not involve in or does not take place in a school, university, or college.   So it could be something out there that I am not aware of, but I'm not aware of anything of that nature.   It is undisputed that these individuals in these residents' programs are enrolled and that they are regularly attending classes by various definitions of the word \"class\".   The clinical experience that they are receiving in hospital rooms, in lecture halls, in circumstances that they are involved in, are educational.   They are classes, and it is undisputed -- undisputed that the purpose of these programs is to educate doctors so that they can achieve board certification and hospital privileges.

Is there an attending physician standing over their shoulder and looking at what they are doing? "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " Well, there's two parts of that question.   The answer to the second part is: Of course not.   There is not a supervising attending physician standing over their shoulder at every moment, but they are being supervised at all the time during their residency program; that is to say that the work that they do is under the supervision, in that broad sense, of an attending physician who looks over what they do, comments on what they do, and so forth.

There is a student and the student is working part time, but you are -- there -- there is no independent significance to this term \"student\" as you read the text; that is, the student and the services are all together.

I think that's one of the examples that the government gives.   I might have guessed that it would come out differently.   But in this case, the purpose for the service is education.

It's a separate thing.   And that's true whether it happens to be medical school or it happens to be lawnmowing.

There is no dispute that the goal is the education, both from the standpoint of the university and from the standpoint of the student, that that is what is accomplished.   And what -- Justice Breyer, what they've said is because you are doing that, the -- the service is incident to the education until you do it for 40 hours.   Then it's no longer incident.   So someone who may be a student under the -- under the government's interpretation is a student until they work that 40th hour a week on a regular basis; then somehow they are no longer a student. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Olson, there has been a concern expressed that if we accept your position that residents are students, it will have ramifications for other areas of the law, notably, the National Labor Relations Act.   Suppose the residents wanted to organize and collectively bargain.   If they are students, they can't do that.   And let's take the Title VII and the other antidiscrimination in employment statutes.   If they are not employed, if they are students rather than employees, then they wouldn't be covered by that legislation. "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " That is the fallacy that the government is making, that you have to either be a student or an employee.   That argument is not correct, because in all other respects, these residents are employees.   The exemption provided in 3121(b)(10) does not come into play unless you are an employee.   So for all those purposes -- Title VII, the Fair Labor Standards Act and so forth -- those are other statutes that define a term in a certain way.   What the -- what the code says in 3121(b)(10) -- that you are an employee, but if you are an employee of a college or a university, and you are a student, which means you are enrolled in classes and regularly taking a program for the purpose of education -- then you don't pay FICA taxes.   It doesn't have any other implication.   And the government's position in that respect, and the argument that's made in the other briefs, is -- are classic red herrings.   They distract from the real issue.   You don't have to be either an employee or a student.   In fact, you have to be both for this exemption to apply, and that is what is happening here.   Now, again, this is -- there may be circumstances where there might be something that's close to the line and the government might say,   \"Well, you're not really a student. \"   And the government really tried that in the Second Circuit, in the Sixth Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit.   And in each one of those cases, the court -- and uniformly, all five circuits, including the Eighth Circuit -- until the government decided to change the regulation to say, essentially, residents are out -- that's basically what they said. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I looked it up in the dictionary, and meaning number one of \"incident\" is: An accompanying minor occurrence or -- occurrence or condition.   Minor.   In other words, there's the big thing, and then there's the incident.   Now, if that's the meaning, well, this is 40.   It's trying to get at whether it's minor or the whole-- "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " But that's the whole dichotomy that doesn't exist.   The person is a student.   They are just doing it long and arduously and they are doing it for several years so that they can be board certified as good doctors in their specialty.   The idea that somehow you are a student if you do it for 39 hours, and if you do it for 41 hours -- the programs are rigorous.   They -- they have been designed by the accreditation programs to be rigorous, so that -- rigorous, so that a doctor will see lots of patients, do lots of clinical work, because that, according to all the record in all of the cases, is where the education takes place.   You need the classes.   You need the laboratory.   But you need to work with patients doing the things that we want doctors to be doing with respect to us when they are certified as a specialist in neurology or whatever it might be.   So Justice Breyer, the idea that -- this is a classic definition of not only an arbitrary but a capricious and irrational regulation.   It says that if -- even if you are a student, you are doing the things where you would have to be a student, and you are doing the types of things that you would make -- makes you a student, and you are doing it for the purposes that would make you for a student, but if you do it a little bit too much, you are too much of a student, and therefore you are not a student. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --Well, that's because of the second meaning here.   It's very surprising.   I'm found, first, reading the statute in the last case, and now I am reading the dictionary.

Breyer", "text": " And here what it is says is: Something arising or resulting from something else of greater or principal import.

Because if you're -- if you're studying, and are doing it for 39 and a half hours, you are a student, and if you do it for 40 and a half hours, all of a sudden you are not doing the same thing?   You are not a student?   The incident-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You have to draw the line. "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " --I accept the word \"incident\".

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, why isn't the answer that the -- that the noneducational aspect of the service has to be incidental to what they are doing? "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " --Well, that might be also.   What we're -- what we're saying -- I don't -- I am accepting the word \"incident\" for the purposes of this case, that there is no question that the work that's being done, the services that are being performed, Justice Alito, are incident to the education.   They are a part of the educational process.   They are subservient to the educational process.   In fact, they make the educational process.

Roberts", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   FICA student exemption covers individuals who are predominantly students but perform incidental employment for their schools.   It does not cover Petitioners' medical residents.   They are full-time employees, and the Treasury Department has reasonably concluded that an employee's paid work does not make him an exempt student, even if he also learns from his job.   And that is true for three reasons.   First, the text of the student exemption makes clear that it is not a broad exclusion for apprenticeships and other learning jobs.   Instead, it's a narrow exemption that applies only to students performing services for a school, college, or university where they are enrolled and regularly attending classes.   And second, when employees are working long hours and being paid substantial amounts, they and their employers should be helping to fund the Social Security system, and they should be earning credit towards benefits so that they and their families will have something to fall back on if they become disabled or die. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If the question is whether someone is predominantly a student or an employee, why shouldn't we ask: Why are they enrolled in this program, and why is the institution enrolling them in the program?   Why are residents enrolled in the program?   Are they enrolled in the program to make money or are they enrolled in the program either because it's a licensing hurdle they have to clear or they want additional education, and why is the institution hiring them?   Is the institution hiring them to get the value of their services or is it hiring them for educational purposes? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " It's probably both, Your Honor, but it's not workable to determine student status by looking at a particular case, whether the predominant motive or the motive of the employee or the employer is education. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " In general, why are residents -- why do medical school graduates become residents?   Are they doing that because they want to earn the 40 to $50,000 a year that they are paid or are they doing it for some other reason? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " I think they are doing it for both reasons, Your Honor.   But many, many individuals pursue their jobs for the primary purpose of learning, like judicial law clerks, like other apprentices.   But they are not included -- they are not covered by this exemption. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Because they don't work at schools. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " Because they don't work at schools, colleges, and universities, and they, you know, may not be enrolled and regularly attending classes.   And so the Treasury reasonably concluded that because this isn't a general exemption for apprenticeships, that they shouldn't construe it as providing a special exemption for apprentices who happen to be employed by schools, colleges, and universities. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What if on average they were paid $10,000 a year?   Would it be the same? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " Yes.   If they would -- if their work -- I mean, here, basically, they have work and the argument is that that work qualifies them as students.   And what the Treasury Department has concluded is that it's going to treat work and study as distinct categories in deciding whether somebody is predominantly a student, and that it's not going to count the work as study even if there's some educational component to it.   And that's reasonable for several reasons, as I said.   First, because the statute just isn't a general provision that's designed to cover apprenticeships.   And second, because when people are primarily workers and they are working for long hours, they should be covered and participating in the FICA system.   And finally, it would be very difficult to determine on a case-by-case basis what's their purpose: What the employer's purpose?   You know, is this job more like study?   Is this job more like work?   And on that basis -- and to, on that basis, decide whether that should make them a student.   So considering all of those things, the Treasury has decided to draw a bright line and say: Study is study; work is work; and if you are not a student independently of that, then your work doesn't make you a student.   And the Treasury has also decided that if you are working full-time, that then you are predominantly an employee rather than predominantly a student, and you are not covered by the exemption.   In addition, FICA's historical development indicates that the student exemption doesn't cover medical residents, because at the same time that Congress enacted the student exemption, it also enacted a separate exemption for medical interns, and it decided not to include residents in that exemption.   And those actions would have made little sense if the student exemption had the scope asserted by Petitioners.   And then in 1965 Congress repealed the intern exemption in order to give young doctors an earlier start in building up Social Security coverage.   And that repeal also wouldn't have achieved its purpose if many and most residents were covered -- were excluded from FICA under the student exemption.   These residents are people.   They are working between 50 and 80 hours a week.   They are working over a long period of time, and they are providing critical patient care with minimal supervision. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What if the school said: You have to get all this clinical experience, but we are going to pay you for the first two hours of the day that you are doing that?   Does that change the analysis at all?   You seem to be focusing on how many hours they are working.   But what if the school says: Well, look, we recognize some of this is going to school and some of this is working, so just like the IRS, we are going to have an arbitrary rule and we are going to say you are being paid for the first two hours. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " Well, the rule is that the paid work doesn't count towards student status, and it doesn't count whether you are doing it for 4 hours, for 10 hours, or for 40 hours.   So in a circumstance where they are only being paid -- they're only working for paid time for a certain amount, then that work -- you would have to look-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It looks more -- if you accept their classification, it looks more like their work is incidental to their status as a student. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " --If you accept the classification in your hypothetical of two hours and the other eight hours?   But those -- that other work wouldn't necessarily qualify as a course of study, either, Your Honor.   I mean, if what they are doing is providing services-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Presumably, you would say it does if they don't pay them anything. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " --No, not necessarily, Your Honor.   What the -- Treasury regulations define what a class is and what a course of study is, and the individuals have to be engaging in that to qualify as students and performing -- giving somebody something of value. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But I thought clinical work couldn't qualify as a course.   Is that wrong? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " Clinical work can qualify as a course under certain circumstances.   But the clinical work that medical students are doing, if you are referring to that, is of an entirely different order than the work-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It certainly -- they can be a student in the last year of medical school and then they are doing intern-level work.   That is -- that is clinical programs where they would be categorized as students. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " --Yes, it's clinical work, but it's very different than the work that the residents are doing.   First, there is the distinction that the residents are getting paid and that the medical students are paying tuition.   But secondly from that, the residents are providing valuable patient care.   Medical students are primarily participating in the clinical activities solely in an educational capacity.   If I could describe the different things-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " We now have a lot of briefs -- we now have a lot of briefs filed in this Court in which a lot of the work is done by students in law school.   I assume they are getting credit for that.   Is that not a course? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " --They are not getting paid for it. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But is it a course?   Is it not a course? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " It might be a course, Your Honor, but they are also engaged in other classes and other activities that make them regularly enrolled and its part of a degree program.   So it's one small -- the clinical course is one small part of that. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I understand that.   I am questioning why you are resisting the proposition that clinical work can constitute a course. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " I'm not resisting the proposition that clinical work can constitute a course.   What I'm saying is that when you are being paid to provide services, that doesn't count as a course, because the IRS has decided to treat work and study as distinct categories in applying this exemption, and that that's a perfectly reasonable distinction.   Nothing in the statute precludes them from doing that, and Petitioners concede that it's reasonable to interpret the statute as limited to the individuals that are predominantly students. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Roberts, do you know the answer to the question I asked Mr. Olson; that is: Are all resident programs schools? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " No, Your Honor, they are not.   First of all, under the IRS's regulation, the IRS defines schools, colleges, and universities to include only those institutions whose primary function is the provision of formal instruction.   And second of all, if on J.A. 27a in the record in this case there is an example of residency programs that are not students.   One of the hospitals that the Hennepin County Hospital that has University of Minnesota residents also has its own residents, and just looking on page 27a if you have the J.A., there is a question.   Question, do the Hennepin County residents, are they enrolled in any academic institution that you are aware?   \"Not at the present time\".   So, that is an example of one, Your Honor.   And that does point out an anomaly about Petitioner's interpretation of the exemption, medical residents who work for hospitals that are operated by schools, colleges and universities would be exempt from FICA tax, but residents who work for other hospitals wouldn't be exempt, even though their work is equally educational.   That is just an illustration of the broader principle that this isn't an apprenticeship exemption, and that's why -- because of that the Treasury has taken this approach to the situation where people are learning on the job. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Roberts, the Petitioner's brief says twice that there is some question.   Assuming that we hold that the -- the residents are subject to the FICA tax, there is some question whether even if they had to pay their tax, whether they would be eligible to receive Social Security benefits or I take it credit for full-time employment? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. Roberts", "text": " There's no -- there's no question, Your Honor.   It's always been the Social Security Administration's position that medical residents are not students exempt from the Social Security Act.   The Social Security Administration stated that in a Social Security ruling as far as back as 1978, and they continue to adhere to that position.   In addition, as a practical matter, the way the Social Security Administration determines whether people get coverage for a particular period under the Social Security Act is they look at the W-2's that come in.   And if FICA tax has been paid, then they put them down as being covered under the Social Security Act.   So as a practical matter, it works that way as well.   As I said before, these workers who are working between 50 and 80 hours a week over many years for substantial salaries, are precisely the kind of workers whose employers should be supporting the Social Security system and who should be earning credit towards disability and survivor benefits.   And we would ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Olson, five minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   With respect to the question that Mr. Roberts was addressing with you, Justice Ginsberg, the record is very unclear.   In the Eighth Circuit residents may not be eligible for Social Security benefits.   It's quite unclear in the other circuits.   And I invite your attention -- and this is cited in the briefs -- to 20 C.F.R. 404.1028, which is a Social Security regulation.   It says   \"If your main purpose is pursuing a course of study rather than earning a livelihood. \"   and it's unquestioned that that is what is happening here,   \"we consider you to be a student, and your work is not considered employment. \" "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Olson, you are not taking issue with what Mr. Roberts has said?   That is, in practice the Social Security looks to see -- they look at the W-2, see that the FICA tax was paid, and if it was, then -- then they get credit for Social Security. "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " Well, that may be what they do, and that may be dependent upon what happens with the FICA taxes, which is going to be determined -- which has been determined in four circuits as not being payable with respect to the residents' programs.   The fact is that the government has taken a position for many, many years.   Talk about deference for a moment.   The National Muffler factors, which we understand still to be appropriate to evaluate deference given to an IRS regulation.   This is not a contemporaneous regulation.   It is something that came along just a couple of years ago.   It's a result-oriented regulation.   It's basically saying, we lost all these cases on the facts in the court of appeals, and now we will pronounce that we will win these cases, because we know all these residents programs involve more than-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " We have said that agencies can clarify situations that have been litigated and positions that they have lost on. "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " --Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So, why is this any different? "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " This is very different, because it -- there's -- not of any change in circumstances or facts.   It isn't a clarification.   It is a reversal.   Because for all those years, the government said we had this predominance test.   If your goal is to pursue a course of study, you are a student.   Now the government is saying, if your goal is to produce a course of study, but you do it for 41 hours a week, you are not a student.   It is a-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Why are we talking about National Muffler?   I thought the whole point of Chevron was to get away from that kind of multifactor ad hoc balancing? "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " --This is up to the Court.   The Court has never set aside National Muffler.   The Court cited the National Muffler case in the Cottage Savings case, which is subsequent to Chevron.   It cited Cottage Savings case in the Boeing case just a couple of years ago.   You may tell me that the factors in National Muffler are no longer something that you would apply, but they are all sensible factors with respect to whether you would give deference to a regulation that pops up 65 years after the enactment of the statute, after the government has lost five cases on the facts which are directly relevant to the facts here, and it's a new regulation and there has been no reliance. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " If Chevron applies, those considerations are irrelevant, right? "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " You don't need to get to the part two, because we submit Chevron would apply and would stop you at step one.   The Congress addressed the fact at issue in this case, it said what students are, people who are regularly -- are enrolled and taking classes.   To the extent you get to the second phase, those factors seem to be appropriate to consider.   If this is important, and if there is some anomaly out there, what the government should have done is turned to Congress, which enacted the regulation that describes student and described what the limitations were.   It has had nothing to do about a categorical limitation that if you are too much of a student, you were not a student.   It is backwards.   If there is some anomaly, and if the government wants to collect the funds from these programs that it has really never collected them from before, then it should turn to Congress.   There has been no reliance -- and well, the intern -- the intern anomaly, one of the court of appeals -- the court of appeals that considered that said it relies completely on non sequiturs.   It relies for the interpretation of one statute with the repeal of another statute 45 years ago and draws inference from the legislative history with respect to that which the repeal took place one year after of the St. Luke's case.   The St. Luke's case, the Sixth Circuit decided that interns were not residents, residents were not interns. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.
