[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 16-498, Patchak versus Zinke. Mr. Gant. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 2(b) of the Gun Lake Act is unconstitutional because it is incompatible with several well-established strands of this Court's separation-of-powers jurisprudence as well as with Article III itself.   With Section 2(b), Congress directed the federal courts to dismiss a pending case otherwise properly before the courts. As a consequence of that directive to dismiss with respect to Mr. Patchak's case, the courts were prevented from performing their constitutionally assigned responsibilities to decide cases before them and to say what the law is in the context of deciding those cases. Section 2(b) is precisely the kind of legislative review of judicial decisions that the framers rejected when they designed the Constitution.   And all of -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Gant, when -- when you say \"directed that a case shall be dismissed,\" are you referring only to the last few words of this statute or are you referring more broadly? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " I'm referring to the -- to the last -- the words that refer to dismissal itself. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   \"And shall be promptly dismissed.\" "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Yes.   And then -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Are you suggesting that if those five words were not in the statute, that the case would come out differently? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " I -- I am not suggesting that.   I think it would still have come out differently; for example, if you dropped the reference to dismissal but left \"maintain,\" the result would be the same.   The same would be true if there had been a removal of judicial review. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " In other words, if two -- if the -- if the statute had contained just 2(a) but not 2(b), same result? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " No.   That -- I understand that to be a different question from Justice Kagan's.   If 2(a) were -- were the only part of the statute, we had no 2(b) -- 2(c) is not at issue here.   So, if we had 2(a) only, we wouldn't be here arguing that there was a separation-of-powers violation. Part of the problem here -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- but if you had 2(b), finished, just \"shall not be filed or maintained in a Federal court,\" full stop, you're saying that would be the same statute as the one we actually have? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " It -- it would still be unconstitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Now, the -- the omission of the \"shall be dismissed\" language is not without significance.   And if I may, I'd like to explain. The direction to dismiss is a quintessential judicial function.   It's not surprising that Black's Dictionary, in defining dismissal, refers to it as especially a judge's decision to stop the case. That's -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, what do you do with the McCardle case? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " McCardle was -- the fact that a statute strips jurisdiction from a court doesn't mean that it's immunized from review under separation of powers.   So the -- the touchstone has to be and the relevant strands of the separation-of-powers jurisprudence at issue here are -- are really two parts. One is, has Congress exercised the judicial power and/or has Congress prevented the courts from fulfilling its constitutionally assigned responsibilities? I submit that both have occurred here as a result of what is in the actual 2(b), but the same result would arise if you omitted just the words \"shall be dismissed.\" "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But, Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If this is a -- just a jurisdiction-stripping statute, could you just say as succinctly as possible what the rule is that you would like us to adopt? What is the -- the separation-of-powers rule that you would like us to adopt with respect to a purely jurisdiction-stripping statute? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Well, I -- I want to be directly responsive to your question, but I also want to say, and I've -- I've made this observation in the briefs, I think the better view is that it is not jurisdictional, and I'm happy to elaborate on that later.   But if we assume that it's a jurisdiction-stripping statute -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, on that, suppose, following up on the initial questions, if all that 2(b) said was that an action relating to this land shall not be maintained in a federal court, would you say that is not a jurisdiction-stripping statute? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " That --- that certainly looks more like a jurisdiction-stripping statute.   The reason I say that it's -- the better view is it's not jurisdictional is -- is at least twofold. One is -- and I -- I have been accused by some colleagues of taking Arbaugh too seriously, but this Court went out of its way in Arbaugh to announce to the world and to Congress in particular that it wanted a new rule, that if a court wanted a statute to be viewed as jurisdictional, you needed to clearly say so. This statute doesn't say anywhere in its text, in its headings, that it's jurisdictional.   In fact, 2(b), the section we're discussing that -- that arguably strips jurisdiction from the courts, uses the phrase \"no claims.\" My research may have been faulty, but I couldn't find a single case using that language in framing a jurisdictional statute. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if one of the things that 2(b) does is to strip jurisdiction, and if \"shall not\" -- \"shall not be maintained\" is a jurisdiction-stripping provision, then I don't see how you can win unless you have a rule that applies to a jurisdiction-stripping statute.   Maybe there are other things in this statute that are vulnerable, so they could be severed. So, to go back to the question I asked, if this is a statute that takes away federal court jurisdiction, what is your separation-of-powers rule? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " The rule -- the rule, I submit, the Court should adopt is if a statute is properly -- deemed as properly -- is properly construed as a jurisdiction-stripping statute, it is still subject to separation-of-powers analysis.   That -- that much is clear from Klein.   However, whatever else about the case might be puzzling, Klein clearly establishes that the mere fact that Congress affixes the label \"jurisdiction\" to a statute doesn't immunize it. So then we return to our touchstone principles here.   Has, through this jurisdiction statute, Congress exercised the judicial power and/or has it prevented the courts from fulfilling their constitutionally assigned responsibilities? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, but when -- as succinctly as you can, Congress violates the separation of powers when it deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction in this circumstance.   And what is the circumstance? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " The circumstance is when it is directly, overtly deciding a case or effectively deciding a case, rather than making new law and leaving it to the courts to apply the new law -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, let's -- let's take -- which is not fictional, suppose Congress enacts a statute that says a federal court shall not have jurisdiction over cases involving prayer in school.   It's constitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " I think that raises serious but -- but somewhat different questions.   Part of what's offensive here to the separation-of-powers principles is that Congress is directing the outcome in a case. It could be a set of cases. And I submit, by the way, look -- looking to Bank Markazi, if there had been 1,000 cases just like Patchak's, I think the outcome would be the same.   So the fact that it was one case is, I think, probative of assessing whether or not the Congress is actually deciding a case, rather than actually making the law to be applied by the courts. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, if that's so, I mean, I thought that you were suggesting a rule that said, well, when you direct one case, that's unconstitutional, but now you've just said you're not saying that. So, again, coming back to Justice Alito's question, I mean, we know that Congress can alter the jurisdiction of the federal courts.   And we know that Congress can alter that jurisdiction and apply it to pending cases.   We've said that over and over again. So what makes -- what would make this unconstitutional if we assumed that this is a jurisdiction-stripping statute? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Because what Congress has done is affect directly here, but it could be indirectly -- dictated the outcome of the case without changing the law. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So, Mr. Gant, it's that last clause -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, the law is the jurisdictional law.   That's what Congress is changing.   Congress is changing jurisdiction. In so doing, Congress is changing the law.   We haven't said Congress has to change, you know, substantive law. Here Congress is changing jurisdictional law.   It's saying, you know, yesterday you had jurisdiction over a certain category of cases.   Today you don't. Now, why is that unconstitutional or when is that unconstitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " That is unconstitutional when in the -- under the guise of -- of changing the rules with respect to jurisdiction, the court is effectively deciding the case and then not letting the courts apply the new law either. So both things have occurred here. So, in Bank Markazi and in Robertson, the reason why those survive separation-of-powers scrutiny was because they changed the law and they left it to the courts to apply to new cases.   You have the exact opposite here. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So, Mr. Gant, if I understand it, the answer to the question, I think, is that last clause, the dismiss -- ordering the courts to dismiss the claim, that up to that point, \"shall not be filed or maintained,\" if that's jurisdictional, as I understand, you and your amici are okay with that.   It's the directing the dismissal. But if that -- if that's the only beef we have, is that really a beef at all because that's a natural consequence of a jurisdiction-stripping statute as McCardle itself, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, right, so there's nothing left.   I think it's almost a virtual quote from McCardle, right, there's nothing left to be done but dismiss.   So where is the real beef here? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Justice Gorsuch, I think what the -- collectively, what the Court's cases instruct us is that we shouldn't stop the inquiry at the label. We know that from Klein.   We know that from other cases.   So this case isn't framed as jurisdictional, but if -- if we assume that the -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Assume -- assuming it's jurisdictional and all you're left with is this complaint about the last clause, why should we care? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " We should care because then what Congress is doing is it's -- it's giving carte blanche to dictate the outcome of cases just by affixing the label jurisdictional. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I -- I thought you, in your response to Justice Kagan, you said it wouldn't make any difference if those last words were omitted, \"shall be dismissed.\" "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You -- would have the same objection. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " I would have the same objection -- let me be clear there.   With respect to pending cases, so there -- the two words that are operative here with respect to pending cases are \"shall not be maintained\" and \"shall be dismissed.\" I'm not talking about the \"filed.\" So, with respect to prospective cases, we're not arguing that Section 2(b) would be unconstitutional because it wouldn't implicate the -- the strands of the separation-of-powers jurisprudence that I was discussing. So it's with respect to pending cases where both the shall not be -- may not be maintained and shall be dismissed are both operative -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I don't think that's the question, Mr. Gant.   I think the question is, and this was what I started with, would you be making the same constitutional argument if the last five words were not there? And I took you to say, yes, you would be making the same constitutional argument, and in so doing, you separated yourself from your amici because I understand your amici, as Justice Gorsuch does, as saying that everything hangs on that last five words. And you're suggesting that not everything hangs on that last five words, that you would have the exact same constitutional objections if those five words weren't in the picture.   Do I have you right? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Yes.   I think the fact that it includes the dismissal term is -- makes it particularly pernicious, so I would say that's additional, pushing it even further beyond. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It's like bad atmospherics? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Well, it -- but it -- but it's not just atmospherics.   As I -- as I suggested earlier, I think there's an argument to be made that a direction from Congress to the courts to dismiss a case is telling the courts how to perform their duties in an impermissible way.   And I also -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counselor -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But then you do get, again, and I think that this is the underlying premise of Justice Gorsuch's question, so take out the last five words, and you were trying to explain why what then just seems a jurisdiction-stripping statute is unconstitutional, in that -- against the backdrop of very consistent precedent that we have that says that Congress can take away the jurisdiction of the federal courts and can do so in a way that affects pending cases. And -- and so why and when is that unconstitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Because you have to pierce the label of jurisdiction and return to the basic principles, which are: is Congress exercising judicial functions or is it preventing the judiciary from carrying out its actions? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It seems that we -- we've been replicating what, among lawyers anyway, is a famous dialogue between Professors Wechsler and Hart about whether Congress can achieve unconstitutional objectives by preventing federal courts from adjudicating claims that those provisions are unconstitutional. You know, during the civil rights era, there were a lot of proposals in Congress that said the federal courts have no jurisdiction over any case in which busing is sought as a remedy.   And those types of proposals are consistently submitted whenever Congress attempts to achieve an unconstitutional result by depriving the federal courts of jurisdiction. So I would have thought your answer is -- is -- I would have thought you would have taken the position that I understand to be ascribed to Professor Hart in the dialogue, which is that that is an indirect way of achieving an unconstitutional result and is subject to the same objection. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " That -- that is my position.   And I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counselor, can I -- I want to switch from personal jurisdiction to sovereign immunity, in part for the reasons that the Chief is -- Chief Justice is talking about.   Okay? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " In Patchak I, I took the position that the Court got sovereign immunity wrong, and basically I argued -- the majority disagreed -- that -- that the Quiet Title Act really granted immunity.   And the majority disagreed and said this had to do with APA waiver of immunity. I look at statutory history and this new act, the Reaffirmation Act, was in the context of that dispute in that case.   And what Congress did was settle the question, which I believe it's entitled to do and is not unconstitutional, it ratified the acts of the Secretary's taking of this land, and by that act, implicated the Quiet Title Act. And so, if it did that, I see this -- and I don't understand why it's not, that waiver of sovereign immunity that the Court did not recognize in Patchak I. And I raise this for two reasons: One, I do think there's a difference between the Congress coming in between two private parties and directing a result in favor of one private party.   I think that's a quintessential separation-of-powers question and a very, very serious one. But I think there is something fundamentally different about suits involving the government because sovereign immunity -- or any suit against the government is a matter only of largesse and -- and the government's voluntary choice. We have repeatedly through the centuries said the government can at any moment take away its sovereign immunity.   It can take away that niceness of giving you the immunity. So I see the potential of less of a problem with separation of powers if -- if the government has withdrawn sovereign immunity than it directing the outcome between private parties.   I would be really frightened if we let the government do that. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Well, I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But -- so, given that statutory history, the only issue that was left alive or was at issue in Patchak I, given that the waiver of sovereign immunity that was taken away tracks the APA language, the APA's language says that a suit can be maintained against the government, why isn't this a sovereign immunity case? Why am I dealing with personal jurisdiction at all or separation-of-powers questions at all? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Because, with respect to both the text of the Gun Lake Act, as well as the statutory history, I submit that sovereign immunity, the restoration of sovereign immunity did not exist.   The text nowhere mentions sovereign immunity.   If you look at -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " We've never said it had to. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Well, it doesn't have to, but there -- there are no other indicia, I submit, that suggest -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All of the statutory history indicia. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The whole fight in Patchak I was over the existence or non-existence of sovereign immunity. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " But given that, and of course the statutory history is to some extent in the eye of the beholder, I look at it and I see, given the history that you've just outlined, that if what Congress had intended to do was to restore sovereign immunity, there would have been more evidence of that. It wasn't mentioned anywhere in any of the -- the hearings.   It wasn't mentioned in the House or Senate reports.   It wasn't mentioned -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, why wouldn't -- wouldn't -- Patchak turned on this Court's holding sovereign immunity had been waived. And now Congress -- using the APA words, and the APA itself doesn't say sovereign immunity, so the APA withdrew the immunity, and this, using the same kind of language, restores it. Why isn't that the appropriate way to look at this case? What did Congress want it to do? They -- we said sovereign immunity is waived.   They said sovereign immunity is not waived. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " I take Congress at its word in what it intended to do, and the D.C. Circuit said the same, which is to void the case, to make it go away, to direct dismissal against Patchak and for Zinke.   That's what -- that's what the statute says.   That's how the D.C. Circuit, I think, properly understood it. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " If this suit had proceeded to a conclusion, would -- and Patchak prevailed, would he be entitled to costs? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " He might be.   And that's certainly one of the things that would have -- there are a number of things that would be addressed on remand.   And for the -- the statute, (a) and (b) are not severable.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, I'm -- I'm wondering if it helps your position to say that the Congress is stripping him of certain rights that he had because of the litigation. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Well, there -- there's no question.   I mean, we'd have to go back on remand in addressing the question of entitlement to costs and others, the entitlement to a declaratory judgment, the meaning of 2(a).   What Congress -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " When -- when you say 2(a) -- "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- imagine that was the only statute.   I thought your claim -- and imagine, as well, that 2(a) is, in fact, constitutional and Congress can say in 2017 that when we took this into federal trust territory, Indian trust territory, that was constitutional.   That's what it does.   All right. If that's constitutional to do that, do you have any case left? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " We do.   We do have a case. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What's the case? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Leaving aside the -- am I assuming that it's separable? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You forget -- suppose (b) and (c) were never there.   They just passed (a). "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " If they just passed (a), as I -- I think I mentioned this earlier in response to another question, we would not be arguing -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I realize that, but my question is: Would your client have a lawsuit? What would be the basis for it? Because I thought his basis was that the taking of the land into trust was not lawful under a particular act because that just referred to tribes that were tribes in the '30s.   Right? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now, this act says we don't give a -- we don't care about that; we say that the government had the power to take it into trust anyway.   And it had that power to take it into trust when it did.   All right? So, if that's the law, what is your client suing about? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " How can he win? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " For purposes of your question, I'm presupposing that that's the law. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " But one thing that happened here is we -- no court could make that determination. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, no, but what's your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " The argument -- the argument is that -- well, we would argue that it's not retroactive.   We would argue -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It says -- it says ratified. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " I -- I understand.   But I -- I -- we haven't briefed this, but I submit that there is an argument, a colorable argument, to be made that ratification is in a sense an endorsement -- if you look at -- on page 2 of the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   So your argument is that (a) applies only to taking into trust after the passage of the act -- the (a), after the passage of (a)? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E.

And to go back to a question to try and more directly answer your question, Justice Gorsuch -- and I want to do save a few moments for rebuttal -- if a statute said we think Smith should win and, therefore, we -- we determine that the courts shall not have jurisdiction, that can't -- the fact that it says it's jurisdictional cannot possibly save it from a separation-of-powers scrutiny and analysis. And this is substantially similar to that situation. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So why -- why is it substantially similar to that situation?

We could change it to -- to 10 Smiths win or in every case of Smith v. Jones.   It's not the number.

"}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Because we have said that that applies to pending suits.   So I guess the question is: Why aren't you saying that every time we said that, we were wrong; that any time Congress changes the jurisdiction of the federal court and then applies to pending cases, that that's a separation-of-powers issue? "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Because Shore and the other separation-of-powers cases of this Court counsel that we should take a functional, practical look at the particulars of the case. And in this case, unlike these hypothetical statutes, you have Congress clearly directing the outcome of the case where, under old law, this Court held that this case may proceed.

Part of that uncertainty stems from this Court's decision in Patchak I, which interpreted the laws enacted by Congress up to that point and concluded that the Quiet Title Act did not bar Petitioner's challenge to the trust status of this land. The Court acknowledged in Patchak I that barring claims like Petitioner's is within Congress's legislative power.   Through the Gun Lake Act, Congress did a couple of things.   It eliminated any doubt about the trust status of this land by ratifying and confirming the Secretary's action in 2005.

The argument that has been raised on the other side is it doesn't -- you don't need sovereign immunity waiver because sovereign immunity doesn't protect a federal employee from a suit alleging that that employee acted in excess of statutory authority. So, I mean, what -- what I suggested in the first part of this argument was we held there is sovereign -- there -- sovereign immunity is not a bar.   Congress says sovereign immunity is a bar.   But the answer to that is, so what? We can sue a federal officer and sovereign immunity wouldn't bar that.

In Block, the state was suing -- bringing an officer suit because it was outside of the statute of limitations in the Quiet Title Act.   What the Court said was you can't just use an officer suit to get around the Quiet Title Act; now that we have Congress's waiver of sovereign immunity in the Quiet Title Act, you have to comply with those statutory provisions.   The same should be true of the APA. So if -- if Petitioner could -- could just bring an officer suit against Secretary Zinke for prospective injunctive relief, that would vitiate the final agency action requirement of the APA, the statute of limitations of the APA.

Those cases are all trying to decide whether Congress has changed the law such that the case is taken outside the scope of Klein. When you have a statute like this one that takes away subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts and gets a category of cases off of the judicial agenda, the Court just has to determine whether this case falls within that category and then it -- it should dismiss.

It says -- and this is relying on Professor Hart, it says, \"It is one thing to exclude completely the federal courts from adjudication; it is quite another to vest the federal courts with jurisdiction to adjudicate but simultaneously restrict the power of those courts to perform the adjudicatory function in the manner they deem appropriate.\" Now, the scholars then explain why that first category, which this case clearly falls within when you're taking federal courts out of the business, entirely raises no separation-of-powers problems. They say, \"by wholly excluding the federal court, Congress loses its ability to draw upon the integrity possessed by the Article III judiciary in the public's eyes.\" And so we think that gets to the core separation-of-powers concerns that are underlying the lines that this Court has drawn.

Shah", "text": " Right.   Well, the reason why we think that statute is different is because of the first part of it.   It's saying there is no jurisdiction. So, when -- when it says Smith loses, it's not in the same way that was in the hypothetical in Bank Markazi where all nine Justices said that that would be problematic. And three reasons why it's different. First, in the Bank Markazi hypothetical of Smith wins in a civil suit between Smith and Jones, that is a merits judgment that the Court had in mind.   Presumably, in Smith wins, there is a merits judgment that the Court -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Suppose -- suppose the statute said, in order to ensure that Smith wins, there shall be no jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A.

So I still think that is distinguishable from the hypothetical statute in Bank Markazi.   And the reason is because of the -- because it's taking away jurisdiction.   So the -- there are a couple reasons why it's different. One is a functional matter.   The judgment is quite different.   It's not a merits judgment.   Smith is presumably not in the Bank Markazi hypothetical. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But you're taking away jurisdiction -- "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " -- in order to have a particular result in litigation. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A.

Why would Smith care? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Well, Your Honor, in -- in Bank Markazi, Smith was the plaintiff.   He cares a lot, because if he wins, he gets an award of relief, and that relief has res judicata effect.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It doesn't say anything about jurisdiction.   And you are enlisting the courts.   You're telling the court you have to -- you take this stamp and you stamp dismissed on it.

Shah", "text": " Well, your -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You aren't dragooning the court into doing something the court doesn't want to do.

And if that, enlisting the courts in that limited matter is a problem, then that's true for 150 years of this Court's precedent. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, that begs the answer -- that begs the answer to the -- the -- the Hart and Wechsler dialogue that when the court -- when Congress strips jurisdiction to achieve an otherwise unconstitutional result, that that's perfectly fine. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Well, Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " And I think that's a very difficult question. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think that question implicates different interests. It's not a separation-of-powers problem, I don't think, for Congress to say a certain set of cases can't be within the federal courts. If they're talking about equal protection cases and singling those out, that runs afoul of the equal protection clause. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, is it -- I understand your answer, but is it a separation-of-powers question if they say, if the claim is separation of powers, the case -- there -- there is no jurisdiction? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, there -- there I grant you we're not arguing that Congress can take away the court's jurisdiction to adjudicate whether there is a separation-of-powers problem itself, the constitutional vow itself, and that's why we're here, on here. We are not arguing that Congress has done or could -- could do that.   It can't prevent the court from adjudicating whether the statute it has passed is constitutional, but that's not what's going on here, we're having a full airing of the claim. The question is: Can they withdraw jurisdiction? And if, in fact, enlisting the courts, as you say, in that limited manner violates separation of powers, well, that's true in the seminal withdrawal of jurisdiction case in McCardle and 150 years of cases after that.   In fact, in McCardle, the Petitioner made -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What about the answer to McCardle is it was just a question of how you get habeas.   There was another route. Congress had closed off one route, but it left open another. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Well, Your -- Your Honor, I guess a couple responses. One is the Petitioner in McCardle actually made the very same argument that Petitioner makes here, is that Congress was targeting my suit when it passed that statute. And the Court expressly addressed that argument and said, no, we're not going to look behind Congress's act. It describes a category of suits.   And we're not going to ask whether Congress had some illicit motive of targeting your suit. That's my first response, Justice Ginsburg. The second response is if, in fact, there's a claim that there is no other forum to bring this case, then maybe there is, as -- as this Court said in Bank Markazi, there are other constitutional limitations.   Maybe that's a due process problem. In fact, Petitioner raised a due process claim in the lower courts.   And in its cert petition, this Court denied cert on the due process claim.   So that is out of the case. We're strictly on separation-of-powers grounds, and there is no separation-of-powers problem in this Court withdrawing jurisdiction, including with respect to pending cases. That's what it did in McCardle.   That's what it did in Assessors v. Osborne.   That's what it did in Hallowell.   That's what -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess I'm -- I'm not quite sure what you're reserving there, Mr. Shah, so here is a hypothetical. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " There's a very large corporation, commits a lot of employment discrimination.   Because it does, it has a lot of employment discrimination suits filed against it. And so the CEO of this big corporation goes to Congress and says: These suits are getting to be a real hassle, and so I'd like a piece of legislation.   And Congress says: Good enough, and it says there shall be no jurisdiction over any employment discrimination suits filed against that corporation. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " All right? And -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and in so doing, it knocks out all these employment litigation -- all these employment discrimination suits that have been filed against that corporation. Is that constitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " It may be unconstitutional, but not for failure of separation of powers, not a separation-of-powers violation.   Maybe that is the type of class-of-one problem that this Court noted in -- in the Court's opinion in Bank Markazi. In Footnote 27, it said: Look, if you're singling out a particular litigant for special disfavored or favored treatment, that's the class -- maybe that's a class-of-one claim. So it's not a separation -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So, if this had said just David Patchak's suit, different case? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Well, Your Honor, if Congress had singled out just Mr. Patchak's suit in the text of the statute, maybe they could have brought that sort of claim.   I still think based on this Court's decision in Bank Markazi that talked about Congress is free to legislate with -- in a particularized manner even with respect to particular cases, it's probably okay, but it would raise at least a harder question.   But make no mistake, the statute here is about a class of cases. Now, I will grant you it is a relatively narrow class of cases, suits that were relating to the Bradley Property.   And as it turned out -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I -- I don't know why the hypothetical that Justice Kagan just put doesn't severely compromise the integrity of the courts.   The courts are hearing cases against one class or -- or against a large class of defendants but not another class. And this, it seems to me, severely -- "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " -- calls into question the integrity of the courts.   And that's a separation-of-powers problem. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I agree with you, everything up until that last part.

Kennedy", "text": " It seems to me that this is intrinsically separation of powers. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think that's an equal protection problem.   And -- and as this Court recognized in Footnote 27, there are claims to deal with that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You can take an extra minute because we're going to give your friend some rebuttal time. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Sure, Your Honor. I guess what I was starting to finish up on was on the -- on the class of claims, it may be a narrow category, but just because it turned out that the only suit happened to be Patchak's, it would be an odd constitutional rule if on the day before they -- if they've passed the statute on the day before Patchak's suit, it's fine.   On the day after Patchak's suit, it's not fine.   And then, if three other people happen to file suit, suddenly it's fine again. That -- that is not a right sort of -- that does not strike us as a sensible constitutional rule.   Instead, you should look at the words that Congress enacted which was trying to insulate a category of cases from -- from this Court exercise -- from any federal court exercising jurisdiction.   That's precisely what Congress has done for over 150 years dating back to McCardle and in a line of cases since then. If there are no further questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Three minutes, Mr. Gant. "}, {"speaker": "Scott E. Gant", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   A few quick points.   I'll try and run through them quickly. Justice Kennedy, I completely agree with you that there is a separation of powers problem posed by the circumstance -- the hypotheticals that were posed.   We shouldn't lose sight of the fact that separation of powers were designed in substantial part to protect an individual's rights and to protect an independent judiciary. What we would have here is, if you affirm and uphold the Gun Lake Act, you will have judges looking over their shoulders wondering if they're going to be next in a case like this Court was in Patchak I, where Congress says we don't like the results.   We're going to take the case away from the courts. We can dress it up using the language of jurisdiction, but it's still taking the case away from the courts and directing the outcome. Now, on the point, the distinction that counsel for the Respondents were trying to drive home, that somehow a direction to dismiss in 2(b) is different because it's not merits. I would refer to the Court to a unanimous decision from last year, CRST versus EEOC, where the Court found the -- the party that was not prevailing in -- that -- that did not win on the merits in the EEOC case was nevertheless the prevailing party. The Court, unanimous Court observed the defendant, however, has fulfilled its primary objective whenever plaintiff's challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason. As anyone who has ever been a plaintiff or represented a plaintiff knows, when the plaintiff's case is dismissed, the plaintiff has lost and the defendant has won. It could have different collateral consequences, res judicata and so on, but fundamentally, when the plaintiff gets kicked out of court, they have lost. Mr. Patchak had that result as -- from 2(b). With respect to the relationship between 2(a) and 2(b), 2(a) does one of two things here.   It's either meaningless because all the work is done by 2(b).   If the suit relates to the Gun Lake -- to the Bradley Property, it shall be dismissed. Or, as the House of Representatives argued on pages 3 and 20 of its brief, what 2(a) -- 2(b) does is it implements 2(a).   This was an extraordinary assertion by the House of Representatives, which came and filed an amicus brief, and they said what they were really telling you is that what the Congress did in 2(b) was it decided what 2(a) means and then kicked the case out of court based on its own understanding while depriving this Court or any other court of the opportunity to say what 2(a) means. Respondents -- Federal Respondents said they didn't know quite what some of the provisions in the Gun Lake Act means except they do know that it prevents Mr. Patchak's case from going forward. This seems to me that their uncertain about the meaning, except when it comes to its application to Mr. Patchak, only highlights the fact that Congress was trying to direct the outcome in Mr. Patchak's case. With respect to the hypotheticals that were posed to Mr. Shah by Justices Kagan and Kennedy, this case is no different, I think, than the hypotheticals you were posing.   This is substantially like Smith wins.   You can play around with the words.   You can say we want Smith to win; therefore, there's no jurisdiction. I don't think anyone here believes that Congress should be able to do that.   So this is effectively the same thing. And finally, Justice Gorsuch, with respect to the Gonzalez case that you were discussing with counsel for the Federal Respondents, in that case, both of the parties acknowledged that there was no dispute about jurisdiction. Thank you for the extra time, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
