[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 09-291, Thompson v. North American Stainless.   Mr. Schnapper. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   704(a), Title VII, prohibits the use of third party reprisals as a method of retaliating against a person who complained to the EEOC or otherwise opposed discrimination.   The text of Section 704(a) doesn't limit the types of retaliation which are forbidden.   The elements of the statute are unrelated to that.   The first requirement is that the plaintiff show that discrimination occurred with regards to the individual who engaged in a protected activity.   In a case like that, like this, that's shown by -- would be shown by evidence that they singled out Ms. Regalado and Ms. Regalado's fiancee.   They didn't go fire anybody else's fiancee.   That was the basis on which this particular action was taken.   Secondly, the plaintiff must show that the conduct was discrimination against the person who engaged in protected activity.   That language is easily applicable to a situation where you single out, say, a family member or a fiancee.   The purpose of that, the complaint can fairly be read to allege, was to punish the person who had engaged in protected activity.   There are a number of Federal statutes that use the word \"against\" in precisely this way.   They say that actions cannot be taken to -- say, against a family member of a sitting judge or other Federal official where the purpose is to act against the official.

She couldn't have gotten awarded damages to him.   I think-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

He was the very target of the illegal act.   The illegality occurs only by means of dismissing him. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

"}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Well, I think the Government -- I think as far as you need to go, which is not the same as saying, that's as far as the law goes, is the standard articulated by the Government, as in McCready, where the action against Thompson was the very method by which the law was violated; that that would satisfy the requirement of person aggrieved. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Where does that come from?   Where does that test come from? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Your Honor, I don't -- I think that's as far as you need to go in this case.   I think the standard of aggrieved is broader than that, but the -- as this has played out in the lower courts since Trafficante, there's a wide range of different kinds of circumstances under which the Trafficante rule has been invoked in Title VII cases.   We're not asking you to address all of those. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I understand the argument.   I don't really -- it's not too helpful, at least to me, to say, as far as we need to go in order to reverse.   That's really not how the statute ought to be interpreted, I would say.   What does it mean?   Now, I understand the argument that \"aggrieved\" means all the way to what's -- all that's necessary is what is necessary to satisfy the Constitution.   And I understand that argument.   It's a very broad argument with a lot of implications.   But if that's not correct, then what is the correct test and where does it come from? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think that there are two other limitations that would be applicable here, as indeed they would have be under Title VIII.   First one is proximate cause, which will cut off a lot of injuries down the road.   And Title VII is adopted against a background of proximate cause rules, and there, I don't think -- we don't contend that in using the word \"person aggrieved\" they meant -- Congress meant to set those aside.   Secondly, the -- I think a fair reading of the word \"aggrieved\" is that it is -- \"aggrieved\" is both, in ordinary English, frankly, broader and narrower than \"injured\".   It is broader -- and that's, of course, not your concern -- in the sense that it covers people who haven't been injured yet but might be injured in the future.   But it also has a second element, which is that the action at issue involves some sort of a wrong.   If someone deliberately knocks me down, I'm injured, I'm probably aggrieved, but not if I'm carrying a football in the middle of a football game.   That's a legitimate thing to do.   So I think that there has to be a wrong, and the wrong has to be the basis of the plaintiff's objection.   You could have a situation where the plaintiff really didn't care one way or another why that harm had happened.   It was -- but in this case, that's precisely why Thompson complains.   He's not suggesting that he would be wronged if he were ever fired at all.   He is aggrieved because he was fired for a reason that was an improper reason, and we think those are -- those are-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What -- what do you do with the argument that says there's a middle step?   You can -- you have the sex discrimination complaint, and then you have Thompson, who is aggrieved in the sense that he was hurt, he was injured.   But they say there's no cause of action, there's no statutory cause of action, for Thompson. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " --Well, the -- we think that's just clearly wrong.   The statute provides a cause of action.   If I might go back to how that came up in the court of appeals, the court of appeals appears to have assumed that third-party reprisals are unlawful.   That's not entirely clear.   Then in footnote 1, the court of appeals said that Thompson was aggrieved.   Notwithstanding that, they then went on to say that -- there's no cause of action in the statute, they said in section 704(a).   That really doesn't make any sense.   The -- the statute provides an express cause of action that says that individuals -- certain individuals, if the requirements are met, can bring lawsuits.   So the question is, as -- as Justice Alito put it and -- and was put before, which is whether the plaintiff is aggrieved.   But if he's aggrieved, he's clearly got a cause of action-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Suppose Thompson were not Regalado's fiancee at the time.   Suppose they were just -- they were just good friends.   Would -- and everything else happened, and he alleged that he was fired in retaliation for her engaging in protected conduct.   The way the company wanted to get at her was by firing her friend.   Would that be enough? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " --Well, the -- the plaintiff would have to prove two things.   First of all, the plaintiff would have to prove that that was indeed the company's motive for picking him to fire him.   Secondly, under this Court's decision in Burlington Northern, the plaintiff would have to show that this is a retaliatory action sufficiently serious that it was -- it would likely persuade a reasonable employee in Regalado's position to dissuade her complaint.   And -- and that's why we've agreed with the Respondents' contention that -- that they're entitled to an evidentiary determination about whether that standard was met here.   So that's an important limiting principle, and it has-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " How does that translate?   How does that Burlington Northern standard translate into this situation in which there is some sort of relationship between the -- the person who engaged in the protected conduct and the person who suffers the adverse employment action?   That's what's troubling to me about -- about the theory.   Where it's a fiancee, it's -- that's a relatively strong case, but I can imagine a whole spectrum of cases in which there is a lesser relationship between those two persons, and if -- if -- if -- unless there's a clear line there someplace, this theory is rather troubling. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " --Well, I think-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Can you help -- can you help provide where the clear line is?   Does it go -- does it include simply a good friend?   Does it include somebody who just has lunch in the cafeteria every day with the person who engaged in the protected conduct?   Somebody who once dated the person who engaged in the protected conduct?   Are these all questions that have to go to a jury? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " --They wouldn't all have to go to a jury.   I mean, the -- the problem, as you cast it, is that the standard in Burlington Northern, no offense, isn't a bright line.   It is the standard, which it is.   And the same question could arise about other methods of retaliation.   What about -- what about cutting someone out of five meetings or ten meetings?   That same problem exists under Burlington Northern no matter what. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, why can't -- why can't they get -- the first question, to go back, is a confusion in my mind: Why couldn't she bring this suit?   And she says, I was discriminated against because they did A, B, C, D to him, and the remedy is, cure the way in which I was discriminated against.   And to cure that way, you would have to make the man whole in respect to those elements that we're discriminating against.   Do you give him back pay?   Do you restore him?   You do everything you would normally have to do because otherwise, she is suffering the kind of injury, though it was to him, that amounts to discrimination for opposing a practice.   What's wrong with that theory? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " I think that that kind of remedy would pose very serious problems under Article III. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Because money isn't going to her. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So what?   She's hurt.   Suppose it was a child that they -- what they -- or suppose they robbed -- they robbed the -- the judge's wife in order to get him to do something?   And -- and that's a crime, and suppose there was a civil statute.   The judge says: The way you cure what you did to get me to do something is you make me whole.   And in that instance, it requires making her whole.   What's the Article III problem?   Well, anyway -- this is crucial, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm just saying-- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Well, I think it -- I think it is of some -- some importance here.   I mean, it -- it -- the -- ordinarily, Article III would bar me from suing for an award of money to be paid to somebody else. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --But that's because the award of money to be paid for somebody else, their absence of money, didn't hurt you, but where there -- for example, if you're a trustee, you certainly can sue to get the beneficiary put back.   There are dozens of cases where you can sue to get somebody else paid back money, and -- and why isn't this one of them?   But anyway, I'm not -- I don't want to pursue it beyond a quick answer, because there are other things in this case.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I understood your brief, and certainly the Government's brief, to take a very expansive view of what type of retaliation would give rise to a cause of action by the -- the directly harmed employee.   Now you seem to be suggesting that that employee would not have Article III standing to bring an action. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " I think we've got a situation here in which this violates the rights of Regalado, but Regalado's ability to herself bring a lawsuit and get a remedy is limited, and that -- that-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You're not taking the position that she could not have sued in retaliation?   It would be awkward because he is -- it's his injury that requires compensation, but are you saying that she could not have brought a retaliation suit? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " --It's possible she could bring a suit.   The question would be whether she had Article III standing to seek the remedy that she was then seeking, which would often be a problem.

You are essentially asking us to read that provision, which is stated expressly in the ADA-- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " If I might respond to that briefly, you're referring to section 12112(b)(4) of the ADA.   That is a provision directed at a very different problem, which is not associations between employees.   It's -- it's directed at employers who might refuse to hire a worker because, for example, he had or she had a child with a disability.   The EEOC's commentaries on the regs about this explain it.   It is -- it is not concerned with employee relations.   It is concerned with a discrimination against a worker -- prospective worker, typically -- because they have a family member who has a disability, and the employer has preconceptions about whether they will be good workers based on that.

There are large numbers of statutes that have a general language like \"person aggrieved\".   But I think that in the case, of the Housing Act, that language fairly describes the ordinary English meaning of \"aggrieved\".   Sometimes Congress does that.   There are other definitions in the Fair Housing Act like that -- like the definition of \"dwelling\".   It doesn't mean U.S. Code.

Now, what is the employer supposed to do then?   They say, well, let's -- we need to survey everybody who is engaged in protected conduct, and now we need to see whether this person who we're thinking of taking the adverse employment action against has a, quote, unquote, \"close relationship\" with any of those people.

It's not the case that so long as somebody is associated with somebody who has complained about discrimination they would be automatically protected under the test that we're advocating.   The reason the relationship is important in this case is because it tends to render plausible the argument that there's a causal connection between the adverse action visited on Thompson in this case-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I understand that.   I do understand that, but I wish you -- I would like you to answer my question.   Does the employer have to keep a -- a journal on the intimate or casual relationships between all of its employees, so that it knows what it's -- it's opening itself up to when it wants to take an action against someone? "}, {"speaker": "Leondra R. Kruger", "text": " --No, I think it's actually quite the contrary.   I think if the employer doesn't know about the relationship, any allegation like the allegation we have in this case simply isn't going to be plausible.   It isn't going to be a plausible contention that there is a relationship between one employee's protected activity and an adverse action visited on the plaintiff. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but you say, but it won't be because of the degree of connection between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the means of retaliating.   I understood your brief.   I'm just looking at page 6.   The limitation you propose is someone -- someone close to him.   The anti-retaliation prohibition prohibits an employer from firing an employee because someone close to him filed an EEOC complaint.   And I guess I have the same concern that we have been discussing for a little while.   How are we supposed to tell, or how is an employer supposed to tell, whether somebody is close enough or not? "}, {"speaker": "Leondra R. Kruger", "text": " Well, if there's -- I don't think there's any reason for the Court to try to fashion a hard and fast rule that identifies some relationships that are close enough and others that aren't.

Let's assume the different -- slightly different, that they're just coworkers, but a coworker who has expressed sympathy for the discriminated person, has spoken about them in a favorable light, or has tried to defend them.

The fact of the matter is that most of the cases that have arisen that have raised third-party retaliation arguments, which are indeed cognizable under a number of -- of employment statutes, and I don't think Respondent disputes that they are rightly so -- have largely concerned relationships like the relationship between parent and child, between husband and wife.   In one case under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, it's involved a relationship between very good friends in the workplace, whereas there is a D.C.

You could very well have Eric Thompson as a spouse who is not employed.   So, for example, if Mr. Thompson had been just -- let's make him a spouse, an even closer relationship than a fiancee, and suppose that his job -- he ran an animal shelter in Carrolton, Kentucky, and it was a benevolent organization, but his only source of revenue was a generous gift from North American Stainless at Christmastime.   And in 2003, after Regalado filed her claim with the EEOC, filed her charge, North American Stainless said, I'm not going to give money this year to the animal shelter, to Mr. Thompson, and I'm not going to do it because of Regalado, who is our employee, because she filed a charge of discrimination.   I'm not going to do anything to help her.   I'm not going to do anything to help him.   In that case, under Mr. Schnapper's standard, any person aggrieved can bring a claim.

And serious harm is defined as materially adverse action which might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.   So unless she suffered that kind of serious harm, nobody wins.   Then the next question is suppose in the course of that, somebody else was hurt.   And the person aggrieved provision suggests because of the history of the word \"aggrieved\" that more than just she can bring the lawsuit.   That's our first question.

Thank you.   Justice Breyer, I believe your question was the scope, and what does this term \"aggrieved\" mean?   And in the Sanders case, the Court said that this term \"aggrieved\" means something broad and it is intended to bring a lot of people in.   But that case was interpreting the APA, which has specific language.   Just like in Trafficante, the Court was considering the Fair Housing Act, both of which have very different -- in the statute in question, the APA says a person suffering a legal wrong because of an agency action or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within a meeting of a relevant statute is entitled to judicial review, and that's much broader than what we have in this case.

I don't know why you say that's broader.   If anything, it's narrower than what we have here.   We just say \"aggrieved\".   It doesn't say within the meaning of a relevant statute.

That's exactly -- exactly the definition of \"aggrieved\" in the Fair Housing Act.   So Congress recognized, just 4 years later, after Title VII was adopted, when it enacted the Fair Housing Act.

What about the third part?   I have a suggestion, and I would like your response, because I'm just playing with the thought.

Under Thompson's theory of the case, anyone who is injured or what he says is aggrieved, anyone who receives injury becomes a protected party.   It's not just bringing the lawsuit, but it's the protected party.   He's not even a silent opposer in this case.   There were -- there were concerns in Crawford about the silent opposer and how do we know who they are.   He says it's based solely upon his relationship.   He has engaged in no protected conduct.   The silent opposer, assuming they can have -- bring a claim, at least engaged in some conduct, but Thompson has no protection under this statute.   He could have very easily gotten the protection.   In our Joint Appendix we submitted the brief that Eric -- or the memo that Eric Thompson submitted to his supervisor just shortly before he was terminated.   He complains in that memo about his compensation, and this is on page 22 and 23 of the joint appendix.   He says-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " 22 and 23 of-- "}, {"speaker": "Leigh Gross Latherow", "text": " --The joint appendix. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Leigh Gross Latherow", "text": " He says in this memo: I am disappointed in compensation this year.   At the time that he submitted this memo to his supervisor, his fiancee had a complaint or a charge with the EEOC pending.   If he had only come forward in this memo, Congress says you would have gotten protection; if he had come forward and said, by the way, I think the way you treat my wife is discriminatory, he would have gotten protection.   The -- the means by which employees get protection under the statute are not very difficult.   All they have to do is to come forward and oppose.   Thompson clearly had an avenue and a means to do that because he was taking -- he was action on his own behalf to complain.   So Thompson wants to bring a claim under -- for Regalado, but he couldn't at that time come forward and step up to the plate and say to the employer,   \"Hey, I have a problem with this. \"   but yet he wants to come into court and to claim his right -- or to claim her rights as a basis to bring this suit.   According to the EEOC statistics, in 1992, when data first began being collected, 14.5 percent of charges filed with the EEOC were retaliation claims.   By 2009 that had risen by 31 percent.   In the Chamber's brief on page 2, they submit or recite to a study that was published in 1994 saying that the average cost to defend an employment litigation in 1994, when the study was published, was $120,000.   In this case what Thompson would propose is to give protected party to a wide range of people; and with respect to the government's position today, at the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals they advocated that there would be no limitation, that everyone would get the protection.   That's a broad -- that is a lot of protection for people, and I can tell you that employers who are faced with someone in a protected party, they are -- employers are reluctant to take adverse decisions against them; they're reluctant to implement discipline; they will postpone implementing that decision because they know at some point they're going to have to establish a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason.   When we -- when we point out -- when we point this out in our arguments, the response by Eric Thompson as -- as to who gets the protection, it's in his footnote on page 4 at his reply, he says that the identity of individuals who might have a claim is a function of the employer's own intent.   So, in other words, in order to determine whether someone has protection, you have to look at the employer's intent.   So there are no protected parties anymore until the employer can establish that they had no intent -- or the other way.   Everyone is protected party until the employer can show that he had no intent.   So what that means at the trial is that there will never be-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm not sure why the employer's intent comes into this.   A is the person who is being retaliated against, and the issue would be did the employer take such action against B as the A would think, quite reasonably -- he would have to reasonably think -- that the actions that the employer took was retaliation, was meant to be -- whatever those words were, was -- it might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. "}, {"speaker": "Leigh Gross Latherow", "text": " --But the position that's set forward by Thompson is you determine whether someone is a protected party by looking at the intent of the employer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, you would have to show he had a retaliatory intent, that's true, but that's true however he retaliates.

That is going to shift the burden to the employer at the outset of the case to prove that there was no retaliation, that there was no intent.   Your Honor, in conclusion, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was correct.   The Sixth Circuit determined that Eric Thompson who was not discriminated against had no protection under the statute.   This Court clearly held in Burlington that the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII is designed to protect employees based upon what they do, based upon their conduct.   In this case Eric Thompson engaged in none of that behavior, he had no conduct, he did not come forward on behalf of anyone; yet he is here asking for remedies, remedies that really should belong to Regalado.   There is no reason that Regalado could not have brought this case.   There -- if the concern is that employers are going to discriminate against employees, the response to that is that employers will still be held liable and can still be held liable, and that is by the person who is discriminated against from bringing the suit.   We ask that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision be affirmed. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Schnapper, you have 3 minutes remaining.

I complained at a time close to my firing; there's a whole series of prima facie elements. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Well, there has to be -- right.   There has to be some evidence that could plausibly give rise to -- to an inference of motive.   Even if I were complaining that I was retaliated against, I can't just come in and say I engaged in protected activity and was fired.   I would need more than that.   So you would need that additional amount here, plus you would also have to have some evidence to give rise to an inference that this third party was selected as a victim.   So it wouldn't -- you could -- you could adapt it.   But getting back to what was asked earlier, there's no question the burden of proof is on the plaintiff at all times to establish motive; and as we get particularly far afield from family members, someone closely associated with the plaintiff, it is going to be difficult to -- to establish, to meet that burden.

I think that would be a pretty good way to -- to keep people from complaining.   But I think the Burlington Northern limitation would -- you know, would have some traction in these cases.   The animal shelter seems unlikely.   But the burden of proof is there.   As the -- as the relationship becomes more attenuated, once you get past family members, I think it's going to be difficult, even at summary judgment for these cases to survive.
