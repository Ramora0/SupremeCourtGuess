[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-118, Hernandez v. Mesa. Mr. Hilliard. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 15-year-old Sergio Hernandez was standing in Mexico, barely across the border, unthreatening and unarmed, when he was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent standing inside the United States. This tragic case is one of the most simplest extraterritorial cases this Court will ever have in front of it for five reasons. First, all of the conduct of the domestic police officer happened inside the United States. Second, it was a civilian domestic police officer. Third it was a civilian plaintiff, not an enemy combatant.   Fourth, it was one of the most fundamental rights, the right to life.   Fifth, the other government involved supports -- the government of Mexico supports the claim. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So is that -- I was trying to figure out from your brief what exactly your rule is. So are all five of those necessary, in your view, for there to be a Bivens claim? Is anything else necessary? Is that exactly the rule that you want us to adopt? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Justice Kagan, the rule that we're asking this Court to adopt to avoid the anomalous result, when a U.S. domestic officer on U.S. soil shoots and there's no constitutional constraints, is that when there is a cross-border shooting involving a Federal law enforcement officer on U.S. soil, and the resulting injury is in close proximity, then Fourth Amendment constraints on that officer should apply. And -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, that's a -- that's a test that, surprisingly, fits the exact facts of your case. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It seems to me that the principles you're arguing for can't be so narrowly confined.   And -- for example, how -- how do you analyze the case of a drone strike in Iraq where the plane in piloted from Nevada. Why wouldn't the same analysis apply in that case? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Chief Justice, if it was a drone strike, I'm assuming that it was -- it was probably military.   I'm assuming that there was cooperation with other governments.   Here, in our case -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So if this were, in your case, somebody from the -- the State National Guard or whatever, then it'd be a different result? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Well, if it was a State National Guard, I'm not sure that they would be shooting across the border, Your Honor.   I mean -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, you can imagine a situation that is not precisely like the facts of your case where military officials may be involved. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " I can imagine that scenario, but that's not the purpose or the intent of this rule. The purpose of intent -- and intent of our rule is simply to involve this Court in addressing an ongoing domestic routine law enforcement issue along our southwest border. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Your -- "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " So the -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Your brief -- your brief excluded military personnel and intelligence personnel. Your -- your brief is limited to, as you said, civilian border patrol officers.   So your drone -- your drone example, I take it from your brief, your answer is that's a military operation. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " That's right, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg.   And we -- and we also recognize -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I understand that, but I'm trying to see what the logic is, other than yours happened to involve a nonmilitary actor and my hypothetical involves a military actor.   Under a -- a Bivens analysis, I'm not sure that that makes a difference. Maybe there will be some defenses once you recognize the cause of action that have to do with the military operation, but I'm not sure why you wouldn't have a cause of action under your theory. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Our theory is meant to -- to address the ongoing problem along the southwest border that has resulted in at least ten cross-border shootings and six Mexican national deaths.   And every time the Constitution, according to the government, turns off at the border, even though all the conduct happens in the United States. I recognize that under the military situation, there are orders that may be being followed. Here we have a rogue officer who actually is not following his own Federal regulations which says you can't use deadly force without imminent peril. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But that isn't the question. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I suppose the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No.   The question -- the question that we -- is our problem, but we have to have your help in solving it, is you have a very sympathetic case.   We write some words.   And those words you're delighted with because you win.   That isn't the problem. The problem is other people will read those words, and there are all kinds of things that happen, maybe military, maybe not.   Perhaps a foreign country with the collusion of people in our country sets off the drone.   That's what the Chief Justice brought in. And are we, in deciding for you, A, deciding as well that anyone who suffers a drone strike can come to New York and bring a law case? Are we deciding that the matter is unclear so that when the proper authorities get advice from their lawyers over in the Executive Branch, they have to say we're confused? Okay? So what are the words that we write that enable you to win, which is what you want, and that avoid confusion, uncertainty, or decide these other cases the proper way? That's the question you've been given three times, and -- and I would certainly like to know your answer. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Justice Breyer, this -- this world does not involve a drone strike, and I do not intend to suggest that it should.   This involves only -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " We know that part.   The question is: what words do we write so that this opinion doesn't affect the drone strike, which is what you seem to want? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Again, so the -- the rule that we are suggesting has a close proximity element to it.   It has all of the conduct of the United States, of the officer on the United States' soil shooting across the border.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, we can take -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Perhaps -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- your test point by point and -- and ask you whether it would apply in a situation where each of those factors was a little bit different. So the -- your client was 15.   What if he was 19? Would that be different? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " No, Justice Alito, of course it wouldn't be different.   But the -- the -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So the rule would apply there. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " The rule would apply if he was 19, standing unarmed in Mexico, when he was shot. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   What if he was armed, but he had his hands up? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Again, we're not asking for a win here.   We're simply asking if the Constitution applies and that he can -- he can -- the defense of self-defense by the officer can happen at the trial court then. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What if he wasn't in this culvert, but he was 200 yards beyond in Mexico.   Would it be different then? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " It may be under the Boumediene element of nature of the site.   So this culvert is unique.   If the -- if the Court -- I would invite the Court to look at Exhibit 180 of the Petition's exhibit -- appendix, which is a picture of the culvert. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And what if the officer was not standing in the United States, but actually ran a short distance across the border into Mexico? That would seem to be worse, wouldn't it? But would you say the rule would be different there? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Justice Alito, it may be because the -- first, the Border Patrol agents are strictly prohibited from crossing the border, like federales are strictly prohibited from -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Right.   So suppose he violates that rule.   He -- he -- "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- crosses into Mexico and then he shoots the -- "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- the Mexican nationals. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Right.   It may not -- the rule would not apply, but it doesn't mean that under Boumediene standards that there's not constitutional protections.   Did he not know where the line was? Did he intentionally go in hot pursuit? Was he called over by a federale? The specifics of the facts would affect the decision of whether the Constitution applied. Under our -- under our proposed rule, as Mexico pointed out in its brief, there's been 243 shootings along the border with the Border Patrol using deadly force, 10 of those across the border. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No, I understand that.   But as Justice Breyer said, we have to articulate a rule that applies.   We can't just say that in -- that -- that on the particular facts here, there was -- the -- Mr. Hernandez's -- the -- the Petitioner's have a -- have a Bivens claim and -- and they're -- it states a violation of the Fourth Amendment.   We have to have a rule to -- that can be applied in other cases. And I don't know what the rule -- what rule you want us to adopt other than to say you win.   And, of course, that's what you -- you need to do for your client.   But you need to give us a principle that is workable. Is it -- is your rule that if the U.S. agent commits on foreign soil an action that would be a violation had it occurred within the United States, there is a Bivens claim and there is a Fourth Amendment violation? Is that your rule? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Justice Alito, no.   So our -- our rule involves all of the conduct occurring on the -- on the United States side. And I -- and I acknowledge a W, as Justice Breyer said, would be nice for our side.   But more importantly, the Border Patrol is 44,000 strong along our southwest border, and they only interact with Mexican nationals.   We've had 10 shootings across the border.   So that we might get the W, it will at least not turn off the Constitution. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Hilliard, if -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, your rule would be the same if this was the first time it happened, if it was one person and the other facts were the same; right? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " My rule may be the same, but my response to the question wouldn't have as much meat on it because we're here after many of these shootings have occurred.   And we're here because the interaction of the Border Patrol in this area, the government has taken the position that on the border, the Constitution turns off if the deadly force goes across the border. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What do -- an anterior question.   It has been argued that the Constitution is only for people who are within the United States; therefore, an alien injured abroad has no Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights.   How do you answer that? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Well, I think that the Boumediene made clear, Justice Ginsburg, that aliens abroad have constitutional rights, depending on whether or not there is a -- after the evaluation, whether functionally, the Constitution should apply.   This Court has -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But that was dealing with habeas. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " That was dealing with habeas. But the Boumediene court did a full survey of the entirety of the extraterritory -- extraterritory cases, and they said there's a common thread. Now, what this Court does is it looks at, where are we sending this -- where are we sending the Constitution and what are we asking it to do? And I acknowledge and recognize and this Court has already said it's not a worldwide Constitution.   But it has gone abroad many times, depending on what it needs to do and what it's being asked to do. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I think you said what your rule is in a pretty clear way.   You've said essentially it's a border area and the shot came from the United States.   So that, I take it, is your rule. So it seems to me that the harder question is actually -- and this goes back to the Chief Justice's question -- why is that your rule? You know, what makes that confluence of factors different from everything else? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Justice Kagan, the reason that's our rule is because the interaction at the border, at our southwest border, has -- has resulted often in shots being fired across the border.   It's not unique to Sergio Hernandez. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I guess you keep saying that, Mr. Hilliard, that there's a problem here, and I respect that.   But there are problems -- there might be problems in other situations as well.   There might be problems when U.S. officials go into a foreign nation's territory.   So -- so that leaves me still uncertain why -- I mean, you're saying as a practical matter, this is where the incidents are.   But is that all you have as to why this is your rule, why the border cases are different? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " So using the -- the framework of Boumediene and the factors in Boumediene, and given that this fact pattern is unique to the case we're here about today, but not unique to the situation on the border, yeah, the Boumediene factors are -- are used to plug in the rule that we're asking for. For example, the -- the Boumediene factors are nature of the site, status of the person seeking the constitutional protection, importance of the right.   So those factors we plugged into this rule to address not just this specific problem, but in reliance on the Boumediene opinion, which said there's a common thread in all these cases.   And as the functional application, we took the -- we took the four elements of -- of the framework of Boumediene and applied them into our rule. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but the one obvious difference with Boumediene is in there, you were dealing with an area subject to an exclusive control of the United States.   Here, you're dealing with Mexico, an entirely different situation. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, I would -- I would acknowledge that you're right.   We are in -- Boumediene is in Cuba, but it's a -- it's a -- it's basically, as Boumediene recognized, United States territory. Here, you have a U.S. law enforcement officer whose -- 100 percent of his conduct is inside the United States, de jure and de sovereign United States property.   No other government could control his actions but our government.   And while inside the United States under his own Constitution, which he has sworn to abide by, he shoots. You know, the hypothetical that I have may -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but just to stop you there.   So is it any time that the U.S. officer is in the United States that that's -- that satisfies the question under Boumediene? It's -- "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " No, it does not. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It's because the injury occurs in a different jurisdiction; right? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " It's because the injury occurs in close -- close proximity.   And this is a unique area.   Again, I would invite the Court to look at Exhibit 180 of the appendix, which shows this culvert does not delineate where the United States ends and where Mexico -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I assume that's true of a lot of borders. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Well -- and the reason that that's important in regards to the truth of that statement is because the United States exercises some degree of control into the culvert.   And as Michael Fisher said in his testimony to Congress, they project outwards from the border. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Does the government of -- of Mexico agree with that? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " The government of Mexico agree -- agrees that their sovereign is violated when the United States shoots bullets into their land and kills their citizens. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " The question is whether the government of Mexico agrees with your statement that the jurisdiction of the United States extends beyond the Mexican border. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, at -- it was not that the jurisdiction extends beyond the border. It's that the control projects from our physical border as Michael Fisher, the head of Border Patrol said, outward.   It's not the first or last line of defense. The -- the government of Mexico has not addressed his statement, but as a fact, along the entirety of the southwest border, the Border Patrol stays on the border and projects authority outward. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " May I ask about an anomaly created by your rule? I take it everybody agrees that if there were a Texas State trooper who was involved in the exact same conduct, that trooper, you -- you would not be able to sue that trooper. So why is it that Bivens, which is usually thought of as a more limited remedy than 1983, I mean, why should you have this situation where you can sue the Federal agent, but not the State agent? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Justice Kagan, in all respects, except where the victim lie, this is a typical Bivens case.   You have a U.S. law enforcement officer exercising unreasonable force, and Sergio Hernandez is in the group of victims that are injured as a result of excessive force. The issue is, is where he fell and where he shot, does it take it out of his right to a Bivens? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, my -- I -- I -- I've waited while the rule was being discussed because that's important; but as Justice Kagan's question indicates, whether or not there can and should be a Bivens action is critical to your case. Since 1988, this Court has not recognized a single Bivens action.   We look for special considerations.   You've indicated that there's a problem all along the border.   Why doesn't that counsel us that this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign affairs where the political branches should discuss with Mexico what the solution ought to be? It seems to me that this is an extraordinary case for us to say there's a Bivens action in light of what we've done since 1988 where we haven't created a single one. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Justice Kennedy, there is no alternative remedy for the family.   There has been 283 shootings, and when those shootings with the border -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But that -- that means it's a critical area of foreign affairs. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " We're not attacking the policy of the United States government in regards to Mexico.   In fact, the policy of the United States is a Border Patrol agent should not use deadly force without imminent peril.   We're asking that when this -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, the policy of the United States, I suppose we can ask them if they're not going to give any compensation from a special bill for Congress or it might be picked up by an executor agreement, the policy of the United States is that this injury, a serious injury, goes unaddressed.   And if we assume that the officer was completely at fault and that there's really no defense, we -- we don't know what the facts are, but if we assume the facts most favorably -- favorably to you, there should be some relief. But isn't this an urgent matter of separation of powers for us to respect the duty that -- that the -- the principle rule that the executive and the legislative have with respect -- respect to foreign affairs? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Justice Kennedy, I would say it is an urgent matter of separation of powers, but it would be the opposite. The -- the fact pattern, if the Court may recall, is Officer Mason had actually grabbed one of Sergio's friends and had him by the scruff of the collar next to him in the United States.   Had he shot that boy, there would be a Bivens claim. If a Mexican national is shot just inside the United States, and the only thing the government can say is it implicates one policy in national security, in that situation, then you've taken away Bivens claims for the largest police force in this country in the area that they operate.   The -- the location of the boy in regards to being shot from the United States should not counsel hesitation.   If -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " So, Mr. Hilliard, you want me to put down in my notes the location of the boy is irrelevant to this case.   That's what -- that's what we're going to put in our opinion? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " You start with -- you start in your opinion that the -- that if all of the conduct happens inside the United States and -- and there's a close proximity cross-border shooting, then the Fourth Amendment -- Fourth Amendment constraints on deadly force apply. To -- to hold otherwise, Justice Kennedy, is -- is to prevent Bivens in the area of the border, whether it's south or north of the line, because if it -- if national security and foreign relations is affected 30 feet across the line and the -- and an officer stands in the same place and shoots Sergio's friend right next to him, then you have one kind -- one Bivens case and one non-Bivens case. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " When I write the reason for that, I write the opinion just as you said it, and it says, but if it's only 30 feet away, the victim, then the Bivens action in the Fourth Amendment apply.   But if it's 30 miles away or 300 miles, they don't.   Okay? That's what you want me to write. Now, the next sentence has to have the reason why I drew that distinction, and that's what I think people have been looking for.   And so just please, if -- if there's anything else you have to say, I think you don't have anything else to say, but if you do, I would say this is a good time to say it. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " My point is the -- the close proximity takes it away from your analogy, Justice Breyer. My -- my point is that if all the conduct -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " That isn't a reason you normally can give in the opinion.   I -- I had a few problems with applying it across the board.   I mean, maybe I could, but is that what I'm supposed to say? Because it took away from the problems that Justice Breyer had. No, of course, you can't say that.   So -- so -- so what -- what is it I can say? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " If I understand your question -- question, Justice Breyer, the reason that Bivens should be allowed if all of the conduct happens in the United States, is -- is because the -- the anomalous -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, all the conduct happens in the United States with the drones. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Right.   But it would be anomalous to say -- anomalous to say that if the Border Patrol agent shoots north, west, and east -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Same with the drones. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " There's a Bivens claim -- if -- it's -- if -- with all due respect, it's not the same with the drones because there is no proximity and there's no cross-border shooting.   There's a drone that goes somewhere else to do something else. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   What about a different approach.   And I just want your reaction because you suggested at the end of your brief, if you have anything to add, do it.   And yes, all the action took place in the United States, but it took place at the border.   Not beyond the border.   At the border. The border is the river.   We have a treaty that says the river.   We also have a treaty that says there will be a line down the middle of the culvert, but the culvert will be maintained by Mexico and the United States jointly.   And there are many documents, including the Treaty of Hidalgo -- you know, that famous treaty which I'm drawing a blank on, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " Hidalgo? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Hidalgo, yes.   Right.   It's referring to the river as the border. So it has not taken place in a foreign country.   It's taking place on territory that jurisdictionally, of course, is Mexico's, but which is a special kind of -- you -- you started talking about the curtilage.   Is there any other word? \"Curtilage\" suggests a house.   Then you started talking about cannon shots going off somewhere.   So you did research into this. Now, if I want to say, this is a special kind of physical place, what words do I use? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " I -- I think, Justice Breyer, I -- and I -- if I get -- get your question in, in the middle of the river, according to the Treaty of Hidalgo is the -- the -- the deepest trench of the middle of the river.   And there's no river here anymore.   It's simply a flat culvert, which is part of the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " We are responsible for maintaining it, not by ourselves, but with Mexico and the reason we are maintaining it is because at one time the whole river and now the line down the center are the boundary, and we don't want the river to jump its banks and create new boundaries.   So this is a boundary case. Now -- now, you obviously explored that and then I think you gave up on it.   And so I would like you to tell me what you want me to hear about it. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " So the curtilage cases were used in order to show that there is a -- a substantive reasonableness evaluation in -- in regards to the close proximity requirement of our rule. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Are you -- are you relying at all -- I -- I'm not sure you did in your brief -- but there in -- in tort law, generally, when there's an act outside that causes injury inside, the regulating rule can come from the place where the conduct occurred.   So that that act outside, injury inside, is a familiar category in tort law. As I understand it, the -- the regulating rule can come from either place, the place where the act occurs or the place where it's effect. "}, {"speaker": "Robert C. Hilliard", "text": " That's right, Justice Ginsburg.   And as a practical matter, as the -- the Mexican juris brief points out, there is no practical way for the courts of Mexico to review this conduct. So I appreciate, if I can get back to Justice Breyer's concern and inquiry, and that is, if all of the conduct happens in the United States and as a fact there is some exercise of control right at the border, then if the injury occurs in close proximity to that border, then that's a rule that would both be workable and would take care not only of the issue with Sergio Hernandez, but would also take care of the issue of the entirety of the southwest border of the United States where the conduct continues to occur even today. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could I ask you to go back to Justice Kagan's question? If the -- if the officer here was a State or a local officer, would you be able to file a claim for damages in the United States in a Federal court? "}, {"speaker": "Robert C.

And if jurisdiction -- if you're not a citizen and you're not in the jurisdiction, are you precluded under 1983?

That's quite a different case, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Randolph J. Ortega", "text": " It is.   However, in Verdugo, the person claiming protection was in the United States. The act occurred in Mexico. Here we have Mr. Hernandez who was seized in Mexico.   He was never in the United States.   The border is very real and very finite.   It's not elastic.

I believe those facts provide or provided even a greater rationale for this Court to extend those protections, given the fact that the United States planned the acts in the United States with Mr. Verdugo in the United States and the search occurring in Mexico. Here, the seizure occurs in Mexico. Mr. Hernandez is in Mexico.   He is outside the sovereign territory of the United States.   There is no de facto jurisdiction of the culvert in this area.   It's -- it's very -- it's dissimilar from Boumediene. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If Boumediene had control, who controlled the base?

So this is not just like a fence.   It is an area of two fences, and between those two areas is joint exercise of border maintenance authority. So I guess it's like nothing I've seen before.   But if it's like nothing I've seen before, what's the problem with taking Justice Ginsburg's approach and applying it to that kind of area where, I might add, 500,000 people walk across it every day and it's a fair inference that -- perhaps that American citizens, adolescents, play in the culvert, too.

I don't want to -- I don't know whether to call it a no-man's land, but it's this liminal area, which is kind of neither one thing nor another thing.

And that's U.S. law that governs the conduct of the Border Patrol police. So I don't understand all this about Mexico. It's the United States law operating on the United States official who's acting inside the United States. This case has, as far as the conduct is concerned, United States written all over it.

Kneedler", "text": " Well, and this -- this Court, in deciding whether to apply Bivens, has -- has looked to the question of whether Congress is the right body to decide rather than the courts. And here we think it clearly is because of the foreign relations implications, not to mention the deeply-rooted presumption against extraterritoriality, all the more so in -- in with respect to this Court's creation -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " As far -- "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S.

"}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " As foreign relations are concerned, at least a Justice of this Court has said that the behavior of our law enforcement agents abroad sends a powerful message about the rule of law to individuals everywhere.   And you're asking us to make a distinction that if the law enforcement agent shoots and kills somebody who's on one side of the border, there is Bivens liability, you tell me that.   If it's just on the other side, although the conduct is identical, the officer is standing in exactly the same place.   I don't know what kind of powerful message about the rule of law that would send. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S.

We know that. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " No.   The border -- the Border Patrol, since this incident -- and we -- we cite this in our brief, has undertaken numerous reforms.

To Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, both of my friends on the other side have now said there's a Bivens claim for the boy who shot next to the officer. Take that position into this hypothetical. The officer shoots the bullet -- shoots the gun.   The bullet leaves the gun.   It's constitutionally -- there's constitutional consequences as the bullet travels all the way to the border. If there's a boy between the bullet -- I mean, the gun and Sergio, and that bullet goes through that boy in the -- in the U.S., and then the same bullet hits Sergio, their position is that there's a Bivens claim and there's a constitutional constraint as to the first boy who dies, but not the second boy that dies. The -- the -- the conduct occurring in the United States, a hundred percent of it, if it gives a Bivens claim, if it gives a normal, standard Bivens claim to the boy who shot somewhere with the -- with the bullet and then does not give one to Sergio Hernandez is -- ends up being anomalous. As to Justice Kennedy's question on the Fourth Amendment, Boumediene decided that it is a -- it is a functional test.   It's a question of judgment, not compulsion, as Justice Harlan said in Reid, and as -- as Boumediene suggested. Verdugo has nothing to do with the application of the seizure by shooting someone dead to the search inside the property.   I think Boumediene -- Boumediene confirms that the fact pattern of someone being killed is enough in a practical way to provide limited constraints. Thank you very much. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
