[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 19-416, Nestle USA versus Doe, and the consolidated case. Mr. Katyal. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Alien Tort Statute has been around since the earliest days of our nation, and yet this Court has never accepted the type of claim that the plaintiffs bring here.   The claim plaintiffs bring alleges something horrific, that locators in Mali sold them as children to Ivorian farms where overseers forced them to work. The defendants are not the locators, not the overseers, and not the farms.   Instead, they are two U.S. corporations, Nestle USA and Cargill.   The plaintiffs do not allege that these two owned or operated any farms, and they do not allege that the companies bought anything from farms that used child labor.   Instead, the companies are an afterthought, a few of 101 paragraphs in their complaint.   They claim the companies made decisions in the U.S. and that they had knowledge of child slavery. This lawsuit fails for two independent reasons.   First, it's extraterritorial.   You've said, when a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none. Here, the plaintiffs haven't alleged any domestic injury or even that they've been to the U.S.   History and this Court's cases make clear that the ATS's focus is the injury or principal wrongdoing from a tort.   Here, that occurred halfway across the globe. And, second, the ATS is about natural persons.   Jesner recognized there is no specific universal and obligatory international law norm of corporate liability that fully applies to domestic corporations.   It's not enough, as the Jesner plurality said, to show \"liability might be permissible under international law in some circumstances.\" Rather, it must be, to use Sosa's language, \"accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th century paradigm.\" These are some of the most fraught decisions government makes.   To say Congress in 1789 made them is to read many difficult policy choices into vague statutory text.   This Court has generally warned against doing that and specifically with the ATS every single time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Katyal, in this case, no foreign country has objected to the United States hailing its own citizens into its own courts.   And why should we be cautious in terms of international relations in such a case? And what objection would foreign countries have to ensuring that U.S. corporations follow customary international law? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So, Your Honor, first of all, I don't think that that's the relevant test because, Nabisco, what you said was even if international friction is \"not necessarily the result in every case,\" the potential for friction militates against recognizing foreign injury claims.   And I think that's true generally. And then, with respect to here, I do think that there's three different impacts on foreign policy that would be recognized -- that would -- that would occur if you were to recognize corporate liability in this case. One is, in Jesner, you talked about the surrogacy problem with the injury nation. The -- the plurality said that plaintiffs can still use corporations as surrogate defendants to challenge corporate governance and said that's what was going on in Kiobel. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, we can always -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " And that very case -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- we can always address that concern with addressing aiding and abetting. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " I agree that that's one way to do this, but I think this Court in Jesner recognized that -- that doing it -- that if you were to recognize corporate liability, you would in some circumstances get this. And, in addition, the para nation concern, I think, would apply just as well, because it would be an end run around Jesner to permit foreign corporations like Nestle to be sued because of their domestic subs, like in this case, but not others. And finally -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Katyal, the tote -- on a slightly different matter, do you agree with the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit that there is a universal norm on aiding and abetting liability? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " We do not, Your Honor. We think that -- that if you were to reach that question, that for the reasons the Solicitor General said, there is no such norm. In Hamdan at Footnote 40, you said -- you said something similar.   The domestic precedents, like Central Bank, I think, are clear on this.   But I think our most important point, Justice Thomas, is that, here, aiding and abetting would translate to aiding an amorphous in this particular case because there's two axes here.   One is extraterritoriality, which is already blinking red here because there is no U.S. injury or principal wrong. And now the plaintiffs want to add this ambiguous concept of aiding and abetting, and you'd be left with an extremely broad statute with no congressional analog whatsoever if you were to accept their interpretation. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " The -- what about the petition, the Respondents here say that even though there may not be an international norm or a universal norm on corporate liability, that that's different in the case of slavery -- slavery? What's your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well -- well, first of all, Your Honor, I think that the norm that they're asserting is not child slavery but aiding and abetting child slavery.   And they fail their own test.   They have not a single case that says there is such a norm of aiding and abetting that. And I think this Court has recognized that the test is a more general one.   It's not specific norm-by-norm.   But, as Jesner and as the -- the language that you joined in Jesner indicates, it's a much more general test of is there a universal specific and obligatory norm. And, here, there isn't.   The only evidence they can even point to about child slavery in particular is one source, a 1930 Liberia report, that says, although government officials used their authority to force labor, there's no evidence that the only corporation in the country did so. That doesn't come close to meeting their burden, that high bar that you and the rest of the Court have talked about.   You have to proceed with great caution.   It's really their severe burden to produce evidence showing some sort of norm here, and they haven't. And so, Justice Thomas -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice -- Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Let me go back to the corporate liability.   One of the three incidents that led to the statute, I take it, was the Marbois affair of 1784, and there was a French adventurer who assaulted the Secretary of the French Legion in Philadelphia and there was no legal remedy for the assault. Now that's so, isn't it? But this statute was designed, in part, to give a remedy. But suppose instead of, I think Mr. Marbois, I'm not certain if he -- which -- which of the parties he is, but suppose instead of him going up and hitting the French Secretary, he had been the president of a corporation and they all sat around and said: I have a great idea.   Let's hit the French Secretary.   So they pass a resolution and went out and hit the French Secretary. Why should that make a difference? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So, Justice Breyer, three things. First, I think your example points to the ex -- the separate argument about extraterritoriality, and I just want to make clear that they are distinct.   Marbois and the other incident really underscore that those are about injury in the United States, which you don't have here. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, that's true, but I'm not asking about that. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " I understand. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm abstracting from that and just speaking of I don't see why exempt all corporations, including domestic corporations, from this -- the scope of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Right.   But, Your Honor, the difference is, in Marbois, under your hypothetical, there very well would be a remedy against the individual perpetrators, and that's exactly what international law requires time and again. You don't go after the corporation, but you absolutely have a remedy.   We're not here seeking any sort of corporate impunity. We're just saying you have to go after the individual unless the statute and Congress makes a different choice. And most notably, Justice Breyer, in the TVPA, which is the most closely analogous statute, it is an ATS cause of action.   And I'm just saying no corporate liability. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, but I'm asking you really what's the reason why, if everything had been done in Marbois by a corporation, why would you want to make the corporation immune from the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " For -- for two reasons: One, because there's already a separate remedy of going after the individuals, and second, because corporate liability, as Congress recognized in the TVPA, has any number of other difficulties, such as mens rea. This Court in Jesner cited Malesko for saying that if you go after corporations and imbue them with liability, then people don't go after individual wrongdoers and, as a matter of deterrence, you might want to go after them -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Oh, by the way, the individual also -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice -- Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Katyal, many of your arguments lead to results that are pretty hard to take.   So suppose a U.S. corporation makes a big show of supporting every cause de jure but then surreptitiously hires agents in Africa to kidnap children and keep them in bondage on a plantation so that the corporation can buy cocoa or coffee or some other agricultural product at bargain prices. You would say that the victims who couldn't possibly get any recovery in the courts of the country where they had been held should be thrown out of court in the United States, where this corporation is headquartered and does business? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Justice Alito, I have three buckets of answers to this, and this is really the heart of the case in many ways, so I'll try to briefly outline them and then hope to detail them. So the first is that that hypothetical is, of course, very far removed from the facts of this case, where they allege minimal U.S. conduct, not some sort of operation run from the United States. Second, I don't think your hypothetical states a violation of the Alien Tort Statute because there is no domestic injury. But third and most importantly, your hypothetical does violate other statutes.   As you said and the Court said in Jesner, the ATS \"will seldom be the only way to hold perpetrators liable.\" And in your hypothetical, there are five different mechanisms that would prevent any abuse.   First is foreign law, the law of the Ivory Coast.   There are already criminal sanctions there, and the State Department and Department of Labor says those are being used. And, indeed, when Congress makes statutes extraterritorial, like the TVPA, they require exhaustion of those foreign remedies first before one can sue in the United States. Second, there's sometimes specific liability under specific statutes.   Like the Genocide Convention in your hypothetical, it might violate the territorial -- Extraterritorial Criminal Force Labor Bar in 18 U.S.C. 1581 to 94. Third, you can bar goods from entering the United States under 19 U.S.C. 1307, and, indeed, the plaintiffs' attorneys are doing that against the defendants right now. Fourth, sometimes there's U.S. liability if an individual acts as a principal. And, lastly, if there's any doubt about this, Congress can specify a specific remedy, an alternative.   They pass extraterritorial laws all the time.   And, indeed, if the violation is so clear of international law and the laws of nations, I would suspect that would be easy. But I think implicit in -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Katyal. My time is up. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, as I listen to you, I -- and your answers to Justice Alito's questions, it seems to me that his hypothetical all pointed to the fact that the aiding and abetting by the corporation happened in the United States. That's -- that's a serious question here about whether there were enough allegations that the acts of this corporation had a sufficient tie to the United States.   I put that argument aside. But we know that under the ATS the first Congress wanted the ATS to cover piracy. We also know that those who provided assistance to pirates were themselves held liable, whether they committed it on land or the sea, as aiders and abetters. And it boggles my mind to think that the aiding and abetting had to have happened on the sea and not on the land because the first -- the 1799 imposed criminal liability for wherever the assistance occurred. And so my difficulty is, in understanding your answer, why it is that the ATS would not have seen aiding and abetting as its own form of criminal liability and the issue being whether there were enough ties to the jurisdiction in which it occurred. I take -- I'm not -- I don't need an answer from you that says to me there wasn't enough here.   I need an answer that says, why wouldn't the framers have seen aiding and abetting in this way? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So, Justice Sotomayor, we certainly don't think that the complaint does say anything like what they claim at the red brief at page 5.   There's a huge delta between the two.   But I understand -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I just said to you I know that there's a question about the allegations. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Right.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Go to the substance of the issue. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- so then, with -- with respect to the law, first of all, I think piracy, as the Court recognized in Kiobel at 121, is a category unto itself because the high seas are jurisdictionally unique and governed by no single sovereign. And the reason why, I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But they're not jurisdictionally unique if it happens on land. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, then I think of what -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And aiding and abetting said, if you assist in any way on the sea or on land, you're liable. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " But I think the problem is, when you translate anything from piracy -- I think the Court's been -- urged great caution in exercising -- in trying to draw too much from piracy because there isn't, of course, another sovereign involved there the way there is, for example, in this very case, where they're challenging the conduct in Ivory Coast and where there's a remedy in the foreign country. And the reason why I think Congress hasn't always recognized aiding and abetting, even with specific statutes that deal with it, is because it does lead to an amorphous form of liability. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " And so -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Katyal, would you -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Katyal, is child slavery, not aiding and abetting it but the offense itself, is that a violation of a specific universal and obligatory norm? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " We're -- we're not -- yes, I think we're not challenging that here. It's just the aiding and abetting. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   So, if that's right, could a former child slave bring a suit against an individual slaveholder under the ATS? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So they -- if it were -- if it weren't extraterritorial and it wasn't a corporate action, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yeah, no problem extraterritorial, no problem aiding and abetting, just a straight suit. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Correct.

"}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Right.   And the reason -- I think there are two different reasons.   One is that when you -- the cite to Malesko from Jesner shows, when you go after individuals, you often can go after the -- the true wrongdoers.   Once you go after the corporate form, you get bogged down with questions of mens rea in a collective enterprise -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " There's an amicus brief -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- which is difficult -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- Mr. -- sorry to interrupt, Mr. Katyal.   There's an amicus brief by Professor Hathaway that details the long history of imposing liability on slave ships. Those were not individuals, were they?

I -- I'd actually like to pick up on -- on this line of questioning.   I don't see anything in the language of the statute and I don't believe you've pointed to anything that distinguishes between individuals and corporations.   And the rationale which Justice Breyer was alluding to for the ATS I think that we've said many times is to ensure that the United States provides a mechanism for aliens to remedy wrongs that would otherwise be held against the United States itself and perhaps be lawful causes for war against the United States. And on -- on -- on those two lines, on the language and on the rationale that this Court has long adopted, or recognized for the ATS, why would we exempt corporations? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I understand your policy arguments. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- so, Justice Gorsuch, the text refers to law of nations.   And what you said -- what you said and others in -- in cases is that that requires looking into whether there's a specific obligatory norm. And, here, there isn't one.   The question is not are you exempting corporations, but, rather, they're -- are they included as a subject of the law of nations, which is the text of the ATS. And you talked about the rationale about not letting things go unremedied, but as I just said to Justice Kagan, there are remedies. You can go after the individuals.   So you don't need to go after the corporations, and, indeed, doing so imposes lots of liability. And our fundamental -- or it imposes lots of problems, like mens rea and the like. And fundamental -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I don't believe you -- okay.   I -- I -- I -- I understand your responses there.   I don't believe you did get a chance to fully respond to Justice Kagan on their last point.   I would like an answer to that.   And that is we do know one thing about the ATS, is that it did permit in rem jurisdiction against things, in particular, pirate ships. If in rem jurisdiction was part of the ATS's contemplation, why wouldn't corporate liability, which then didn't exist, I mean, in serious -- in widespread form, but why wouldn't the same concept apply? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " For -- for the exact reasons -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Briefly. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- that the Court said in Jesner, Justice Gorsuch, which is -- you know, the same argument was made there.

Your position, however, would allow suits by aliens only against individuals, as you've said, and only for torts international law recognized that occurred in the United States. And Professor Koh's amicus brief on behalf of former government officials, for example, says that your position would \"gut the statute.\" So why should we do that? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, I really feel like that's some overheated rhetoric.   You know, after all, for 200 plus years this statute's been around, there's not a successful example of a case like this ever, Justice Kavanaugh. All we're suggesting is to preserve the status quo as it's always been.   I understand there's some policy arguments for why you might want something else, but that's really something addressed to a different branch of government. And for all the reasons the Court said in Jesner and you said in your dissent in Exxon versus Doe, recognizing corporate liability here or making it extraterritorial in the way that the plaintiffs want raises a host of really difficult intricate policy questions, which are best left handled by the other branch, not by courts. I mean, this is an extraordinary thing they're asking the Court to do in fashioning a common law remedy, and that's why every decision of this Court says proceed with great caution.

"}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " We think, you know, for -- just as the Jesner plurality said, you know, the -- the evidence bleeds over from step 1 to step 2.   We think the evidence for step 1 on corporate liability is overwhelming, and we also think that the extraterritoriality, which is independent, is really pretty -- is very, very clear because, as the Court said in Morrison, there's always some U.S. conduct that can be pointed to in any case.   And it'll be a craven watchdog if you can just use that to get out of the extraterritoriality bar. And this case is a perfect example of this.

And when there are those allegations of such wrongdoing, there are five different parts -- paths, apart from the ATS, to protect human rights.

But this Court should not extend the reach of the Alien Tort Statute to encompass Respondents' claims in this case for two principal reasons. First, the ATS does not authorize liability for domestic corporations for the same reasons that the majority and the plurality in Jesner found that foreign corporations are not liable.   As the Jesner majority said, a decision to extend liability from natural persons to corporations must be made by Congress rather than the judiciary.

But we're trying to be consistent with the Court's precedents here, and Jesner rejected key parts of our argument there and key parts of our reasoning, and it reinforced a connection between the ATS caution that the Court should have about recognizing new forms of liability and extensions of liability and other areas such as Bivens.   It reinforced that connection in Hernandez. And we've consistently opposed corporate liability in the context of Bivens, and under that rubric, we think that the same answer applies here. And we -- the question that the Court is asking is whether there is reason to doubt whether Congress would want this damages remedy to be available for artificial persons. And we know that there are times when Congress makes that decision.   It did so in the Torture Victim Protection Act.   This Court did so in Malesko. And now that Jesner has made foreign corporations not liable, it would be especially incongruous to discriminate on the basis of the defendant's nationality in the corporate context because we know that that's not happening in the context of natural persons. The Marbois incident that Justice Breyer brought up has been discussed by Sosa and Kiobel, and in both cases, the Court assumed that both the Frenchman and the New York constable who assaulted an ambassador in the United States would be liable. So, if both foreign and U.S. natural persons are liable, we think that Congress should be the one that makes the decision that U.S. corporations would be discriminated against in a way that foreign corporations are not.

You can't sue the individual because, in my hypothetical, the individuals have all moved to Lithuania.   All you have is the corporate assets in the bank and minutes that prove it was a corporate decision. What's new about it? Why is it creating a form of action? What's the reason it shouldn't be there?

We think this is controlled by Sosa step 2.   And Congress has used two different models.   They've used the Torture Victim Protection Act, where they ruled out all artificial persons.   Only natural persons can be sued.   So that takes care of all your questions about corporations or limited liability companies or partnerships or anything else. Only natural persons can be sued under the Torture Victim Protection Act for something that everybody understands is a violation of the law of nations. Now Congress did take a different route in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act where they ultimately recognized a civil remedy, but it departs from the ATS in multiple ways. It didn't make the civil provision retroactive. It doesn't discriminate between a U.S. corporation and a foreign corporation found in the United States.   It's arguably extraterritorial at Morrison step 1 in a way that the ATS is not.   And it provides a specific cause of action with details that are tailored to the particular violations at issue.

And in the civil action it provided in 1595 for -- for crimes associated with slavery and forced labor, it specifically extended that action to whoever knowingly benefits financially or receiving anything of value from a venture that engaged in that underlying conduct.

And that's true, but one might make a broader point, that the first Congress enacted the ATS in response to its concerns about other nations being offended by our failure to remedy international law violations. And one might ask why one would think that another country would be less offended by leaving a foreign victim without a remedy when that victim is injured by a U.S. corporation rather than by a U.S. -- a U.S. individual and, indeed, that most of the countries around the world with which we're usually associated as a rule of law nation do not make that distinction.

You say that the focus of the tort should be the primary conduct, so, here, what was happening in Cote d'Ivoire, rather than the aiding and abetting, which you characterize as secondary. But why should that be so? I mean, let's imagine you have a U.S. corporation or even a U.S. individual that is making plans to facilitate the use of child slaves, you know, making phone calls, sending money specifically for that purpose, writing e-mails to that effect.

The contrast between the Torture Victim Protection Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act show that is a policy choice that could go either way and the decision should be made by Congress. And if the Court reaches the question of extraterritoriality, then even assuming that aiding and abetting is actionable, the focus of any forced labor tort here was overseas.   That's where the injury happened and where any substantial assistance was provided. So plaintiffs' claims call for an impermissibly extraterritorial application of the ATS.

Hoffman", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The first Congress in the Alien Tort Statute provided a federal forum for foreign citizens to bring cases for law of nations violations without limitation as to defendants for a series of tort liability. Plaintiffs are former child slaves seeking compensation from two U.S. corporations which maintain a system of child slavery and forced labor in their Ivory Coast supply chain as a matter of corporate policy to gain a competitive advantage in the U.S. market. The international norms prohibiting child slavery and forced labor are indisputably specific, universal, and obligatory.   The norms apply directly to private parties, including corporations. Unlike Kiobel and Jesner, this case does not seek to assert U.S. jurisdiction over foreign corporations for actions against other foreign citizens they took on foreign soil. This case alleges violations of long-established norms prohibiting child slavery and forced labor by U.S. corporations from the United States. The founders were particularly concerned about actions of U.S. citizens that might lead to foreign entanglements, and their response was to provide for a federal judicial forum to resolve such disputes based on the rule of law. The recent discovery of legal opinions written by Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph in the 1790s make it clear that the ATS applied when U.S. citizens violated the law of nations on foreign soil and that the ATS's broad language applied to violations beyond the Blackstone norms without any need for further congressional action. These claims fit comfortably within the text, history, and purpose of the ATS and this Court's holding in Sosa, and it should be allowed to proceed. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, this case, of course, involves United States citizens and United States courts.

I think Mr. Gannon has said that the United States has no particular objection about this particular case on foreign policy grounds within the Footnote 21 context or others.   So there really is no evidence that that's true.

It's not clear that -- that aiding and abetting is not available under the TVPA, but -- but this Court certainly decided in Mohamad that corporate liability is not available. But the Court has said that it looks to the most analogous statute.   And what we contend is that the Trafficking Victim Protection Act, which deals specifically with forced labor and slavery in supply chains, is the most analogous.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. -- Mr. Hoffman, on the question of corporate domestic liability, the government makes the argument that Jesner changed everything.   It originally took the same position that you're taking now on corporate domestic liability.   It said that that position is now untenable, that once the Court held that foreign corporations weren't liable, the Court really can't hold that domestic corporations are.   What -- what is your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Paul L. Hoffman", "text": " Well -- well, first of all, I think that the -- the evidence that justified using Sosa step 2 to eliminate liability against foreign corporations really does exist with respect to domestic corporations sued under the ATS. And, actually, Jesner and Kiobel are of a piece in a way.   With what this Court has said is that ATS jurisdiction should not be used to police the actions of foreign corporations, particularly when they act primarily on foreign soil, whereas our case is completely different in the sense that the United States has its own responsibilities in these provisions.   That was the original plan that founded together the ATS, that we were saying to the world we will enforce the law of nations. And I think that the Jefferson and Randolph opinions recently underscored that, that we made a commitment to the world that when our citizens violate the law of nations, even if it's outside U.S. territory, that we will provide a forum for foreign citizens to do that. Both Kiobel and Jesner deal with completely different situations where there's minimal contact with the United States and where it's really the responsibility of other countries to police their own corporations. In Kiobel, for example, the Netherlands has -- has allowed for a case on behalf of the Kiobel plaintiffs against the same defendants for the same allegations.   So the Netherlands has stepped up to police its own corporations. What we're saying is that the United States has that obligation according to the founders' original promise under the Alien Tort Statute. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, you know, as you note, Jesner is a -- is a fractured decision. There's a majority in some places, only a plurality in other places. If you look at that decision, what do you think it tells us about the approach that we need to use to answer the question of domestic corporate liability for child slavery? I mean, what is controlling, do you think, with respect to how we go about answering that question? "}, {"speaker": "Paul L. Hoffman", "text": " I don't think that there is a controlling majority in Jesner about how to approach that question.   The plurality does discuss the question of whether there needs to be a specific and universal and obligatory norm of corporate liability. I think, for the reasons that the Solicitor General's Office gave in the Kiobel case and in Jesner, that corporate tort liability is -- is well established and was understood, I think, to the founders and certainly has been a part of U.S. domestic common law tort liability from the beginning, as soon as there were corporations.   And before that, there were ships. So we think that that's not -- that basically what international law provides, are the prohibitive norms, in this case, child slavery and forced labor.   But the means of enforcing them are up to individual states. And in the ATS, our first Congress said that tort liability using common law methods were something that our courts would enforce the law of nations.   And there's no requirement that -- that there be mandatory corporate liability.   It's up to states. And many states -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.   Thank you.

And I guess I want to understand why I should be creating new causes of action as a Judge today. We have abandoned federal common law in every other area after Erie, or at least we proclaim to do so.   And I'm not sure I understand why the ATS should be different, especially when Congress stands able and ready to create new causes of action, as the Chief Justice has pointed out it's done elsewhere. That would be the appropriate -- more appropriate place to create new legislation, it would seem, and in every respect, what you're asking us to do is a form of legislation. And then finally I throw into the mix Central Bank, which underscores that aiding and abetting liability is a different thing and that often there are good reasons not to have aiding and abetting liability even when there's primary liability. So whatever I think about the question, I have to at least acknowledge there are good arguments for a lawmaker to consider on both sides of that question, which, again, takes me back to my question wondering whether I'm the right person to be making this pitch to rather than a legislator. Can you help me with that? "}, {"speaker": "Paul L. Hoffman", "text": " Sure, Your Honor. The -- I think the -- the main answer is that this Court in -- in Sosa decided that the original authorization that the first Congress made to the courts to enforce the law of nations using common law methods was still viable, notwithstanding Erie and notwithstanding many of the arguments that -- that the defendants make in this case, and that if there was a specific universal and obligatory norm of the same degree of definiteness and consensus as the -- the norms that applied in the 18th century, that it was appropriate for this Court to recognize the ability to enforce those norms by tort liability in our courts. And -- and, basically, the -- the norms about child slavery and forced labor are as -- as quintessential Sosa qualifying norms as could possibly be imagined. Now, with respect to aiding and abetting liability, for one, I think that if the Court wants to reach that issue, I think it would benefit from full briefing and argument on that issue specifically because those were not exactly in the questions presented, but -- but our position on aiding and abetting liability is that, in fact, the founders understood aiding and abetting liability.   There was aiding and abetting liability in British common law that was received in our law. The Bradford opinion talks about U.S. defendants -- U.S. nationals aiding and abetting French -- the French in terms of their attack on Sierra Leone.   The Talbot decision, I think, as Justice Sotomayor noticed, deals with aiding and abetting liability. So it's not -- the idea in the Alien Tort Statute was to provide a remedy and reparations when U.S. citizens violated the rights of -- of foreign citizens.   And the -- the first Congress was not looking to restrict the -- the nature of liability.   They were -- they would not want to exempt corporations and give them immunity.

Kavanaugh", "text": " I have a different flavor of Justice Gorsuch's broader question about separation of powers.   And this case really is a case, I think, about the proper role of the judiciary as compared to the proper role of Congress here in fleshing out the Alien Tort Statute. As you know, Sosa and Jesner and our other cases have said the court -- the courts should not be out in front in fleshing out the cause of action here.   It didn't go -- it didn't reject it entirely.   It didn't take Justice Scalia's position, but it shouldn't be out in front. And two sources in particular the Court has said to look to to constrain the cause of action to make sure, as Justice Gorsuch said, we're not creating it ourselves, and one is, of course, making sure the norm is sufficiently rooted in international law, as you know. And my concern on that is the language of Sosa doesn't just talk about the norm, as you know, but Footnote 20 specifically directs us to look at the particular perpetrator being sued and the category of perpetrator, whether it's a corporation or individual. And I've looked at this before, as you know, and looked at it again, and I think it's hard to argue that corporate liability in international law is a specific universal and obligatory -- or specific and universal. Foreign law is different.   Justice Kagan rightly points that out.   And there may be debatable policy reasons for drawing a line between individual and corporate liability, but it's -- but it's hard to argue that it's there in international law. That's my concern in this case, stems on the question presented on corporate liability stems from Footnote 20 and the content, as I see it, of international law.   So I'll give you an opportunity to respond to that. "}, {"speaker": "Paul L. Hoffman", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think that the -- the -- the question I think we would argue at Footnote 20 was addressed to the distinction between norms that applied directly to private parties, including corporations, versus norms that required some connection to state action.   I think that the citations there make that fairly clear. I don't think it was saying that corporate liability had to be a specific universal and obligatory norm because that's really not the way the international system works.   Many governments do impose corporate liability for violations of international law. For example, in a -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " That's a -- I think that's a different question, though, and that gets to Justice Kagan's point, which I think is a good one, that foreign -- foreign law does impose corporate liability, of course, as does U.S. law in many circumstances, but international law and the international tribunals have not seemed to do so. "}, {"speaker": "Paul L. Hoffman", "text": " Yeah, it's correct that in -- in certain international tribunals for -- for reasons specific to those tribunals, did not impose liability on corporations, but the Alien Tort Statute's basically a tort statute.   It's a civil tort statute. And I think the international human rights amicus indicates that corporate liability is a general principle of law.   It applies in all legal systems.   It has applied in our legal system from the beginning.   It applied in -- in Britain before we were a nation. In other words, corporate tort liability is the -- is the norm.   It's not the exception.

So we've talked a little bit about the foreign policy implications or lack thereof of our recognizing a cause of action against domestic corporations for violations of international law norms, but could you say a little bit about any foreign policy implications that might be the result of our failing to recognize such a cause of action?

Few international norms are as fundamental as the prohibitions against child slavery and forced labor.   Plaintiffs' claims satisfy every Sosa requirement and fit squarely within the text, history, and purpose of the ATS.

This case isn't about that.   It's about whether this old statute applies extraterritorially and who can be sued. When asked by Justices Alito and Sotomayor where in the complaint is there any knowledge of slavery by the defendants, my friend couldn't answer.   Zilch. This case is an easy one on extraterritoriality where there is no U.S. injury and little U.S. conduct.   Accepting the complaint would create the craven watchdog problem of Morrison.   Indeed, a breathtaking kennel of problems, as my friend's opening line admitted that, lawsuits \"without limitation on defendants or theories of tort liability.\" And even if aiding and abetting liability exists, Justice Sotomayor, it doesn't get around extraterritoriality.   Rather, its ambiguity highlights the problem, as Justice Breyer's worry to my friend shows.   The ATS's focus is still the injury or principal wrongdoing.   Otherwise, it's truly aiding and amorphousness. Second, my friend suggests our view guts human rights law.   But ours was a law for at least the first 200 years with no practice of ATS liability.   Indeed, Congress knows how to fashion specific remedies for the extreme hypotheticals and already has. I heard no answer from my friend to the five mechanisms to prevent abuse. Third, my friend's arguments never grapple with Justice Kavanaugh's point that in every case -- that every case has said that this Court shouldn't be out in front.   It's his high burden under Sosa to convince you a specific universal norm exists.   He doesn't. Fourth and finally, for corporate liability, Justice Breyer, in your query what's new, this Court's majority, not the plurality, Justice Kagan, in Jesner, said there are harms to separation of powers and hard policy choices about how to maximize deterrence, foreign investment, and foreign policy. Congress sometimes uses corporate liability and sometimes doesn't, like the TVPA. The queries today about how can we exempt corporations, it makes no sense, could be said about torture, but in the TVPA, Congress said there was no liability for corporations. The fact that there are two reasonable choices shows you should defer to Congress. Same with extraterritoriality. Sometimes Congress extends a statute that way, like genocide, other times it doesn't.   Nothing in the ATS says it reaches an injury halfway across the globe. And the new Jefferson and Randolph letters are about U.S. conduct, bringing people to the U.S. as slaves, and they're about alienage jurisdiction under Article III. Neither says the ATS overcomes the extraterritoriality bar. Justice Breyer, you asked, do we want a judge deciding this? This thin and accusatory complaint and my friend's admission of just how open-ended and transformative his liability would be answers that question. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
