[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case Number 11-398, Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida.   Mr. Long. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The Anti-Injunction Act imposes a pay first, litigate later rule that is central to Federal tax assessment and collection.   The Act applies to essentially every tax penalty in the Internal Revenue Code.   There is no reason to think that Congress made a special exception for the penalty imposed by section 5000A.   On the contrary, there are three reasons to conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies here.   First, Congress directed that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes.   Second, Congress provided that penalties are included in taxes for assessment purposes.   And third, the section 5000A penalty bears the key indicia of a tax.   Congress directed that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes.   That derivative triggers the Anti-Injunction Act which provides that   \"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax may be maintained in any court by any person. \" "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, that depends, as -- as the government points out on whether that directive is a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to how he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a directive to him and to the courts.   All -- all of the other directives there seem to me to be addressed to the Secretary.   Why -- why should this one be directed to the courts?   When you say in the same manner, he goes about doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply accept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless adjudicate the cases. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Well, I think I have a three-part answer to that, Justice Scalia.   First, the text does not say that the Secretary shall assess and collect taxes in the same manner; it just says that it shall be assessed in the same manner as a tax, without addressing any party particularly. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, he's assessing and collecting it in the same manner as a tax. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Well, the assessment -- the other two parts of the answer are, as a practical matter, I don't think there is any dispute in this case that if the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, this penalty, the section 5000A penalty, will as a practical matter be assessed and collected in a very different manner from other taxes and other tax penalties.   There -- there are three main differences.   First, when the Anti-Injunction Act applies, you have to pay the tax or the penalty first and then litigate later to get it back with interest.   Second, you have to exhaust administrative remedies; even after you pay the tax you can't immediately go to court.   You have to go to the Secretary and give the Secretary at least 6 months to see if the matter can be resolved administratively.   And third, even in the very carefully defined situations in which Congress has permitted a challenge to a tax or a penalty before it's paid, the Secretary has to make the first move.   The taxpayer is never allowed to rush into court before the tax -- before the Secretary sends a notice of deficiency to start the process.   Now if -- if the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply here, none of those rules apply.   That's not just for this case; it will be for every challenge to a section 5000A penalty going forward.   The -- the taxpayer will be able to go to court at any time without exhausting administrative remedies; there will be none of the limitations that apply in terms of you have to wait for the Secretary to make the-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Why -- why will the administrative remedies rule not be applicable -- exhaustion rule not be applicable? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Well, because if the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply there is -- there is no prohibition on courts restraining the assessment or collection of this penalty, and you can simply-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, but courts apply the exhaustion rule.   I mean, I know you've studied this.   I'm just not following it.   Why couldn't the court say well, you haven't exhausted your remedies, no injunction? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Well, in -- you could do that, I think as a matter of -- of common law or judicially imposed doctrine, but in the code itself which is all -- I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act is an absolutely central statute to litigation-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Yes, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --about taxes.   And the code says, first it says you must pay the tax first and then litigate.   So that's the baseline.   And then in addition it says you must -- I mean, it's not common law; it's in the code -- you must apply for a refund, you must wait at least 6 months.   That's -- many of these provisions are extremely specific, with very specific time limits-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " They would apply even if the rule is not jurisdictional.   The only difference would be that the court could enforce it or not enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to the Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle.   It's a case quite similar to this in which the constitutionality of the Social Security Act was at issue, and the government waived its right to insist upon the application of this Act.   Of course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't waive it.   So are you asking us to overrule the Davis case? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Well, Helvering v. Davis was decided during a period when this Court interpreted the Anti-Injunction Act as simply codifying the pre-statutory equitable principles that usually but not always prohibited a court from enjoining the assessment or collection of taxes.   So that understanding, which is what was the basis for the Helvering v. Davis decision, was rejected by the Court in Williams Packing and a series of subsequent cases -- Bob Jones.   And so I would say effectively, the Davis case has been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Long, why don't we simply follow the statutory language?   I know that you've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by later cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act is \"no suit shall be maintained\".   It's remarkably similar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed Elsevier:   \"No civil action for infringement shall be instituted. \"   And that formulation, \"no suit may be maintained\", contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act, that says the district court shall not enjoin.   That Tax Injunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says   \"courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding in State court. \"   So both of those formulas, the TIA and the no injunction against proceedings in State court, are directed to \"court\".   The Anti-Injunction Act, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says \"no suit shall be maintained\", and it has been argued that that is suitor-directed in contrast to court-directed. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Right.   Well, I mean, this Court has said several times that the Tax Injunction Act was based on the Anti-Injunction Act.   You are quite right, the language is different; but we submit that the Anti-Injunction Act itself, by saying that no suit shall be maintained, is -- is addressed to courts as well as litigants.   I mean, after all, a case cannot go from beginning to end without the active cooperation of the court. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But how is that different from no civil action for infringement shall be instituted -- \"maintained and instituted\"?   Anything turn on that? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Well, it's -- I mean -- perhaps a party could initiate an action without the act of cooperation of the court, but to maintain it from beginning to end again requires the court's cooperation.   And -- and even if -- I mean, if the Court were inclined to say as an initial matter if this statute were coming before us for the first time today, given all of your recent decisions on jurisdiction, that you might be inclined to say this is not a jurisdictional statute.   A lot of water has gone over the dam here.   The Court has said multiple times that this is a jurisdictional statute.   Congress has not disturbed those decisions.   To the contrary-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, Congress said that many times, but is there any case in which the result would have been different if the Anti-Injunction Act were not viewed as jurisdictional but instead were viewed as a mandatory claims processing -- rule? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --There -- there are certainly a number of cases where the Court dismissed saying it is jurisdictional.   As I read the cases, I don't think any of them would necessarily have come out differently, because I don't think we had a case where the argument was, well, you know, the government has waived this, so, you know, even -- if it's not jurisdictional-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, the clearest -- the clearest way of distinguishing between the jurisdictional provision and a mandatory claims processing rule is whether it can be waived and whether the Court feels that it has an obligation to raise the issue Sua Sponte.   Now, if there are a lot of cases that call it jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out differently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a mandatory claims processing rule, you have that on one side.   And on the other side, you have Davis, where the Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General; the Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was a waiver; and, there's the Williams Packing case, which is somewhat hard to understand as viewing the Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision.   The Court said that there could be a suit if -- there is no way the government could win, and the Plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm.   Now, doesn't that sound like an equitable exception to the Anti-Injunction Act? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --No.   I think the -- I think the best interpretation of the Court's cases is that it was interpreting a jurisdictional statute.   And, indeed, in Williams Packing, the Court said it was a jurisdictional statute.   But, again, even if you have doubt about simply the cases, there is more than that because Congress has -- has not only not disturbed this Court's decision stating that the statute is jurisdictional, they've passed numerous amendments to this Anti-Injunction Act. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, it seems -- you can't separate those two points.   The idea that Congress has acquiesced in what we have said only helps you if what we have said is fairly consistent.   And you, yourself, point out in your brief that we've kind of gone back and forth on whether this is a jurisdictional provision or not.   So, even if Congress acquiesced in it, I'm not sure what they acquiesced in. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Well, what you have said, Mr. Chief Justice, has been absolutely consistent for 50 years, since the Williams Packing case.   The period of inconsistency was after the first 50 years, since the statute was enacted in 1867.   And there was a period, as I said, when the Court was allowing extraordinary circumstances exceptions and equitable exceptions, but then, very quickly, it cut back on that.   And since -- and since Williams Packing, you have been utterly consistent-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, even since Williams Packing, there was South Carolina v. Regan.   And that case can also be understood as a kind of equitable exception to the rule, which would be inconsistent with thinking that the rule is jurisdictional. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Well, again, I mean, I think the best understanding of South Carolina v. Regan is not that its an equitable exception, but it's the court interpreting a jurisdictional statute as it would interpret any statute in light of its purpose, and deciding in that very special case, it's a very narrow exception, where the-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Mr. Long, in Bowles, the Court looked to the long history of appellate issues as being jurisdictional, in its traditional sense, not as a claim processing rule, but as a pure jurisdiction rule, the power of the Court to hear a case.   From all the questions here, I count at least four cases in the Court's history where the Court has accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and reached a tax issue.   I have at least three cases, one of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where exceptions to that rule were read in.   Given that history, regardless of how we define jurisdictional statutes versus claim processing statutes in recent times, isn't the fairer statement that Congress has accepted that in the extraordinary case we will hear the case? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --No.   No, Justice Sotomayor, because in many of these amendments which have come in the '70s and the '90s and the 2000's, Congress has actually framed the limited exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act in jurisdictional terms.   And it's written many of the express exceptions by saying notwithstanding Section 7421-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But doesn't that just prove that it knows that the Court will impose a claim processing rule in many circumstances, and so, in those in which it specifically doesn't want the Court to, it has to be clearer?

Long", "text": " --Well, but Congress says, notwithstanding 7421, the Court   \"shall have jurisdiction to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes in very limited-- \" "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could you go back to the question that Justice Alito asked.   Assuming we find that this is not jurisdictional, what is the parade of horribles that you see occurring if we call this a mandatory claim processing rule?   What kinds of cases do you imagine that courts will reach? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Right.   Well, first of all, I think you would be saying that for the refund statute, as well as for the Anti-Injunction Act -- which has very similar wording, so if the Anti-Injunction Act is not jurisdictional, I think that's also going to apply to the refund statute, the statute that says you have to first ask for a refund and then file, you know, within certain time -- so it would be -- it would be both of those statutes.   And, you know, we are dealing with taxes here, if people-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That wasn't my question. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --I'm sorry.

If it's not jurisdictional, what's going to happen is you are going to have an intelligent federal court deciding whether you are going to make an exception.   And there will be no parade of horribles because all federal courts are intelligent.   So it seems to me it's a question you can't answer.   It's a question which asks   \"why should there be any jurisdictional rules? \"   And you think there should be. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Well, and, Justice Scalia, I mean, honestly, I can't predict what would happen, but I would say that not all people who litigate about federal taxes are necessarily rational.   And I think there would be a great-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I just don't want you to lose the second half of your argument.   And we have spent all the time so far on jurisdiction.   And I accept, pretty much, I'm probably leaning in your favor on jurisdiction, but where I see the problem is in the second part, because the second part says   \"restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. \"   Now, here, Congress has nowhere used the word \"tax\".   What it says is penalty.   Moreover, this is not in the Internal Revenue Code \"but for purposes of collection\".   And so why is this a tax?   And I know you point to certain sentences that talk about taxes within the code-- "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --and this is not attached to a tax.   It is attached to a health care requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --so why does it fall within that word? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Well, I mean, the first point is -- our initial submission is you don't have to determine that this is a tax in order to find that the Anti-Injunction Act applies, because Congress very specifically said that it shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as a tax, even if it's a tax penalty and not a tax.   So that's one-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But that doesn't mean the AIA applies.   I mean -- and then they provide some exceptions, but it doesn't mean the AIA applies.   It says \"in the same manner as\".   It is then attached to chapter 68, when that -- it that references that as \"being the manner of\".   Well, that it's being applied -- or if it's being collected in the same manner as a tax doesn't automatically make it a tax, particularly since the reasons for the AIA are to prevent interference with revenue sources.   And here, an advance attack on this does not interfere with the collection of revenues.   I mean, that's -- you have read the arguments, as have I. But I would like to know what you say succinctly in response to those arguments. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --So specifically on the argument that it -- it is actually a tax, even setting aside the point that it should be assessed and collected in the same manner as a tax.   The Anti-Injunction Act uses the term \"tax\"; it doesn't define it.   Somewhat to my surprise, \"tax\" is not defined anywhere in the Internal Revenue Code.   In about the time that Congress passed the Anti-Injunction Act, tax had a very broad definition.   It's broad enough to include this exaction, which is codified in the Internal Revenue Code.   It's part of the taxpayers' annual income tax return.   The amount of the liability and whether you owe the liability is based in part on your income.   It's assessed and collected by the IRS. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " There -- there is at least some doubt about it, Mr. Long, for the reasons that Justice Breyer said, and I -- I thought that we -- we had a principle that ousters of jurisdiction are -- are narrowly construed, that, unless it's clear, courts are not deprived of jurisdiction, and I find it hard to think that this is clear.   Whatever else it is, it's easy to think that it's not clear. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Well, I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act applies not only to every tax in the code, but, as far as I can tell, to every tax penalty in the code. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Long, you -- you said before -- and I think you were quite right -- that the Tax Injunction Act is modeled on the Anti-Injunction Act, and, under the Tax Injunction Act, what can't be enjoined is an assessment for the purpose of raising revenue.   The Tax Injunction Act does not apply to penalties that are designed to induce compliance with the law rather than to raise revenue.   And this is not a revenue-raising measure, because, if it's successful, they won't -- nobody will pay the penalty and there will be no revenue to raise. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Well, in -- in Bob Jones the Court said that they had gotten out of the business of trying to determine whether an exaction is primarily revenue raising or primarily regulatory.   And this one certainly raises -- is expected to raise very substantial amounts of revenues, at least $4 billion a year by the-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But Bob Jones involved a statute where it denominated the exaction as a tax. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --That's-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Here we have one where the Congress is not denominating it as a tax; it's denominating it as a penalty. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --That's -- that's absolutely right, and that's obviously why, if it were called a tax, there would be absolutely no question that the Anti-Injunction Act applies. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Absolutely.   But even the section of the Code that you referred to previously, the one following 7421, the AIA, it does very clearly make a difference -- 7422 -- make a difference between tax and penalties.   It's very explicit. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Yes, that's -- it does, that is correct, and there are many other places in the Code where-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " The best collection I've found in your favor, I think, is in Mortimer Caplin's brief on page 16, 17.   He has a whole list.   All right.   So -- I got my law clerk to look all those up.   And it seems to me that they all fall into the categories of either, one, these are penalties that were penalties assessed for not paying taxes, or, two, they involve matters that were called by the court taxes, or, three, in some instances they were deemed by the Code to be taxes.   Now what we have here is something that's in a different statute that doesn't use the word AIA reason, which is to say to the Solicitor General, we don't care what you think, we, in Congress, don't want you in court where the revenue of a state -- Tax Injunction Act -- or the revenue of the federal government is at stake, and, therefore, you can't waive it.   Now I got that.   Here it's not at stake and here are all the differences I just mentioned.   So I ask that because I want to hear your response. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Well, I mean, there are penalties in the Internal Revenue Code that you really couldn't say are related in any -- in any close way to some other tax provision.   There is a penalty -- it's discussed in the briefs -- for selling diesel fuel that doesn't comply with EPA's regulations, you know.   So there are all kinds of penalties in the Code, and I think it's -- it could be-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Long, aren't there places in this Act -- fees and penalties -- that were specifically put under the Anti-Injunction Act?   There is one on health care plans, there is one on pharmaceutical manufacturers, where Congress specifically said the Anti-Injunction Act is triggered for those.   It does not say that here.   Wouldn't that suggest that Congress meant for a different result to obtain? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Well, I mean, Congress didn't use the language the Anti-Injunction Act shall apply-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " No, but it -- it in section 9008 and in section 9010-- "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --it specifically referred to the part of the Code where the Anti-Injunction Act is. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Right, all of subtitle F, which picks up lots of administration and procedure provisions, but those -- those are fees, and they are not -- Congress did not provide, you know, in the sections themselves that they should be paid as part of a tax return.   So they were free-standing fees, and by using that subtitle F language, Congress plugged in a whole set of rules for how to collect and administer the fees, and it went not just to assessment and collection -- and the IRS has recognized this -- but to examination, privacy, a whole series of additional things.   So I think it would be a mistake to look at that language and say,   \"oh, here's Congress saying they want the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. \"   They are actually doing more than that.   And, yes, I grant you, you could look at section 5000A, the individual coverage requirement, and say, well, they could have been clearer about saying the Anti-Injunction Act applied, and that's certainly true, but, again, they were trying to accomplish a lot.   Maybe-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It's easier to talk about this case if we just forget the words   \"for the purpose of restraining assessment and collection. \"   In a sense, that brings the jurisdictional question and Justice Breyer's question together.   It seems to me -- maybe you could just comment on that language.   Is that sort of language usually contained in a jurisdictional provision?   I mean, you often don't know the purpose of a suit until after the thing is underway.   I can see it with malicious prosecution and some civil rights cases.   Does it strike you as somewhat unusual to have this provision in a jurisdictional case? "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " --It does strike me, honestly, as a bit unusual, but this is an old statute.   I mean, this -- the core language is essentially unchanged since 1867, and, you know, I think that's part of the explanation for it.   And, again, it's, you know, become the center of a series of provisions that very carefully control the circumstances in which litigation about federal taxes can take place. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Long, there's another argument that has been made that I would like you to address, and that is all this talk about tax penalties is all beside the point because this suit is not challenging the penalty.   This is a suit that is challenging the must-buy provision, and the argument is made that, if, indeed, \"must-buy\" is constitutional, then these complainants will not resist the penalty.   So what they're seeking is a determination that that \"must-buy\" requirement, stated separately from penalty, that \"must-buy\" is unconstitutional, and, if that's so, that's the end of the case; if it's not so, they are not resisting the penalty. "}, {"speaker": "Robert A. Long", "text": " Well, I think that argument doesn't work for two reasons.   I mean, first, if you look at the Plaintiff's own complaint, they clearly challenge both the minimum coverage requirement and the penalty.   At page 122 of the Joint Appendix they challenge the requirement that the individuals obtain health care coverage or pay a penalty. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why is that?

But even if they had filed a different complaint, I don't think you -- in this case I don't think you can separate the minimum coverage requirement from the penalty because the penalty is the sole means of enforcing the minimum coverage requirement.   So -- so, first, I mean, I think these Plaintiffs would not be satisfied if the Court were to render a judgment saying the minimum coverage requirement is invalidated; the penalty, however, remains standing.   Anybody who doesn't have insurance has to pay the penalty.   Then they would have to pay a penalty equal to the cost of insurance and they wouldn't even have insurance.   So I don't think that would be-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

I don't see a statement that they will, you know, never incur a penalty under any circumstances.   But -- but even if that were so, what this Court has said in Americans United is the Anti-Injunction Act bars any suit, not just to enjoin the collection of your own taxes, but to enjoin the collection of anyone's taxes.   And so even if it were really true that these plaintiffs were not interested in the penalty and would never pay the penalty, if they were to succeed in this case in striking down the minimum coverage requirement the inevitable result would be that the penalty would fall as well, because the government couldn't collect the penalty for failing to follow an unconstitutional requirement, and so it would still be barred because it would be a suit that would prevent the collection of some of the-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, let me take us back to Justice Kennedy's question about the \"for the purpose of\" language.

Long", "text": " --Well -- -- well, I mean, this Court in the Bob Jones case, where a similar kind of argument was being made by the plaintiff in that case, said: Look, you know, where the -- where it's inevitable that this is what the suit is about, they're sort of two sides of the same coin, that clearly is a primary purpose of the suit.   And it's -- and you can't by clever pleading get away from that.   That's just the nature of the situation. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Mr. Long, aren't you trying to rewrite the statute in a way?   The statute has two sections.   One is the you have to have insurance section and the other is the sanction.   The statute has two different sets of exceptions corresponding to those two different sections.   You are trying to suggest that the statute says: Well, it's your choice; either buy insurance or pay a -- or pay a fee.   But that's not the way the statute reads.   And Congress, it must be supposed, you know, made a decision that that shouldn't be the way the statute reads, that it should instead be a regulatory command and a penalty attached to that command.

And the reason I say that, if you look at the exemptions from the penalty, the very first one is you are exempt from the penalty because you can't afford to purchase insurance.   And it just doesn't seem reasonable to me to interpret the statute as Congress having said, well, you know, this person is exempt from paying a penalty because we find they can't afford to buy insurance, however they still have a legal obligation to buy insurance.

Congress has authority under the taxing power to enact a measure not labeled as a tax, and it did so when it put section 5000A into the Internal Revenue Code.   But for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, the precise language Congress used is determinative.

And I -- I would, if I could follow up on a question, Justice Ginsburg, that you asked Mr. Long in terms of the language of the Anti-Injunction Act 7421(a), which can be found at page 16A of the appendix to our brief.   I -- I'd ask the Court to compare that to the language of the very next provision in the code, which is on the next page of our statutory appendix, 17A, which is the refund statute which we've talked about a little bit so far this morning, 7422(a).   The refund statute this Court held in Dolan was jurisdictional, and the Court in both Dolan and Brockamp held that the statute of limitations that applies to the refund statute cases is jurisdictional.

In Reed Elsevier, it was pointed out that the provision there had numerous exceptions to it.

In fact, as I said, they were the same provision back in the earlier days.   That's the closest analogue.   This isn't -- and it's actually 7422 that's a statute that says do something first.

And one -- one way I think it's helpful to -- to get at this is -- is to look at the history.   We've cited a string of court of appeals cases in a footnote in our opening brief, and over time, it's been very consistent that the courts of appeals have treated the Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision.   Again, if the Court agrees with our statutory construction, you don't need to reach this issue.   But they have -- in fact, one of those cases, the Hansen case, the district court in that case had dismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).   The Court of Appeals vacated and sent it back with instructions to dismiss under 12(b)(1), which is the subject matter jurisdiction provision.   So I do think that, to the extent this issue is before the Court, it is jurisdictional, but it doesn't need to be before the Court because of the statutory construction argument that we had offered.

There are other provisions that fall outside of subchapter B of chapter 68 and, therefore, wouldn't be governed by the instruction in Section 6671(a), which answers the question about the applicability of the act for most penalties.   The ones that we've identified, and I may be overlapping a little bit with Mr. Long here, one is 26 U.S.C. 857, which poses certain penalties in connection with the administration of real estate investment trusts.   There are provisions that Mr. Long identified in his brief, Sections 6038(a) through (c) of the Code, which impose certain penalties with respect to reporting requirements for foreign corporations.   We have, in addition, in footnote 22 at page 36 of our brief, identified three provisions that Mr. Long also identified about -- about alcohol and tobacco.   Now-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Could we address, General, the question of whether there are any collateral consequences for the failure to buy -- to not buy health insurance?   Is the only consequence the payment of the penalty?

"}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " --Yes.   That is not a correct reading of the statute, Justice Sotomayor.   The only consequence that ensues is the tax penalty.   And the -- we have made a representation, and it was a carefully made representation, in our brief that it is the interpretation of the agencies charged with interpreting this statute, the treasury department and the Department of Health and Human Services, that there is no other consequence apart from the tax penalty.   And I do think, if I could talk for a couple of minutes about the argument that was discussed as to whether this can be conceived of as a suit just challenging the requirement, which is entirely stand-alone based on inferences drawn from the exemptions.   I really don't think that's right.   And if I could spend a minute on it, I think it's important.   The exemptions in section 5000A, it is true that there are two categories of exemptions.   There are exemptions to the penalty and exemptions to the subsection (a) requirement.   But the -- but I think, not only as a practical matter, but as a textural indication and even as a legal matter, they -- both function as exceptions to the requirement.   First, as a practical matter, one of those exemptions is a hardship exemption.   And if the Court will just bear with me for one minute here, it's at page 11A of the appendix to our brief.   It provides that a person can go to the secretary of HHS and obtain a hardship exemption for -- which would, as a formal matter here, excuse compliance with the penalty.   It seems to me to make very little sense to say that someone who has gone to an official of the United States and obtained an exemption would, nonetheless, be in a position of being a law breaker.   We think another way in which you can get to the same conclusion slightly differently is by considering the provision on the prior page, 10A, which is 5000A -- 5000A(e)(3), members of Indian tribes.   Members of Indian tribes are exempt only from the penalty as a formal matter under the structure of the statute here; but, the reason for that is because members of Indian tribes obtain their healthcare through the Indian Health Service, which is a clinic-based system that doesn't involve insurance at all.   It's an entirely different system.   They were taken out of this statute because they get their healthcare through a different system.   And it doesn't make any sense to think that persons getting their health care through the Indian Health Service are violating the law because -- exempt only from the penalty, but still under a legal obligation to have insurance, when the whole point of this is that they're supposed to be in a clinic-based system.

Justice Ginsburg, for reasons you suggested, we think the text of the Anti-Injunction Act is indistinguishable from the text of the statute that was unanimously held to be non-jurisdictional in Reed Elsevier.   That statute said no suit shall be instituted.   This statute says no suit shall be maintained.   No-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " They are different things.

The point is-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No -- that -- that -- that's not true.   The suit here has nothing to do with hearing the action.   It has to do with a form of relief that Congress is barring.   It's not permitting -- it is not a tax case, you can come in afterwards.   It's not permitting the court to exercise what otherwise would be one of its powers. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G.

You are right that once you file -- once you pay your taxes and then file the refund action, the act of filing the taxes converts the suit from one seeking prospective relief and to one seeking money damages.   And in that sense, you could think of the statute as a remedial limitation on the courts.   But whether you think of it as an exhaustion requirement or a remedial limitation, neither of those characterizations is jurisdictional.   In Davis v. Passman you said that a remedial limitation doesn't go-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It does seem strange to think of a -- a law that says no court can entertain a certain action and give a certain remedy as merely a claim processing rule.

No.   Okay?   And so there is strong reason that is there.   You tried to apply that reason to the copyright law.   You can't find it.   Registration with the copyright register is not the life's blood of anything.   Copyright exists regardless.   So the reasoning isn't there.   The language -- I see the similarity of language.

And for that reason alone, we think the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply.

Katsas", "text": " I'm not sure the answer is nothing, but even assuming it were nothing, it seems to me there is a difference between what the law requires and what enforcement consequences happen to you.   This statute was very deliberately written to separate mandate from penalty in several different ways.   They are put in separate sections.   The mandate is described as a 20 times, three times in the operative text and 17 times in the findings.   It's imposed through use of a mandatory verb \"shall\".   The requirement is very well defined in the statute, so it can't be sloughed off as a general exhortation, and it's backed up by a penalty.   Congress then separated out mandate exceptions from penalty exceptions.   It defined one category of people not subject to the mandate.   One would think those are the category of people as to whom Congress is saying: You need not follow this law.   It then defined a separate category of people not subject to the penalty, but subject to the mandate.   I don't know what that could mean other than-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And let me give you an example of one category of person that might be -- the very poor, who are exempt from the penalty but subject to the mandate.   Mr. Long says this must be a mandate exemption because it would be wholly harsh and unreasonable for Congress to expect people who are very poor to comply with the requirement to obtain health insurance when they have no means of doing so.   That gets things exactly backwards.   The very poor are the people Congress would be most concerned about with respect to the mandate to the extent one of the justifications for the mandate is to prevent emergency room cost shifting when people receive uncompensated care.   So they would have had very good reason to make the very poor subject to the mandate, and then they didn't do it in a draconian way; they gave the very poor a means of complying with the insurance mandate, and that is through the Medicaid system. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Katsas, do you think a person who is subject to the mandate but not subject to the penalty would have standing? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Katsas", "text": " Yes, I think that person would, because that person is injured by compliance with the mandate. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What would that look like?   What would the argument be as to what the injury was? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Katsas", "text": " The injury -- when that person is subject to the mandate, that person is required to purchase health insurance.   That is a forced acquisition of an unwanted good.   It's a classic pocketbook injury.   But even if I'm wrong about that question, Justice Kagan, the question of who has standing to bring the challenge that we seek to bring seems to me very different -- your hypothetical plaintiff is very different from the actual plaintiffs.   We have individuals who are planning for compliance in order to avoid a penalty, which is what their affidavits say.   And we have the States, who will be subject no doubt to all sorts of adverse ramifications if they refuse to enroll in Medicaid the people who are forced into Medicaid by virtue of the mandate.   So we don't have the problem of no adverse consequences in the case.   And then, we have the separate distinction between the question of who has Article III standing in order to maintain a suit and the question of who is subject to a legal obligation.   And you've said in your cases that even if there may be no one who has standing to challenge a legal obligation like the incompatibility clause or something, that doesn't somehow convert the legal obligation into a legal nullity.   Finally, with respect to the States, even if we are wrong about everything I've said so far, the States clearly fall within the exception recognized in South Carolina v. Regan.   They are injured by the mandate because the mandate forces 6 million new people onto their Medicaid rolls.   But they are not directly subject to the mandate, nor could they violate the mandate and incur a penalty. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Could I just understand, Mr. Katsas, when the States say that they are injured, are they talking about the people who are eligible now but who are not enrolled?   Or are they also talking about people who will become newly eligible? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But that does seem odd, to suggest that the State is being injured because people who could show up tomorrow with or without this law will -- will show up in greater numbers.

And the parties' principal argument why that does not make the Anti-Injunction Act applicable is that, well, that simply goes to the Secretary's activities.   And I would simply ask, if -- if you look at chapters 63 and 64 of the Internal Revenue Code which are the chapters on assessment and collection, they are not just addressed to the Secretary.   There are many provisions in there that are addressed to courts and indeed talk about this interaction, the very limited situations in which courts are permitted to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes.   There was a statement made that there aren't -- and many of the exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act are in the assessment and collection provisions -- there was a statement made that none of these directly confer jurisdiction to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes.   That's not true.   In footnote 11 of our opening brief, we cite several.   I'll simply mention section 6213 as an example.   That says -- I quote:   \"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the time that such prohibition is enforced, may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the Tax Court. \"   \"The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction to enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund under this subsection unless a timely petition for redetermination of the deficiency has been filed, and then only in respect of the deficiency that is the subject of such petition. \" "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

The -- the over-arching thing in my mind is it's -- it's up to Congress within leeway.   And they did not use that word \"tax\", and they did have a couple of exceptions.   And it is true that all this language that you quote -- you know, the first two sentences and so forth, it talks about the use of tax in the IRC.   It talks about the penalties and liabilities provided by this subchapter.   And we look over here and it's a penalty and liability provided by a different law, which says collect it through the subchapter, and it has nothing to do with the IRC.   See?   So we've got it in a separate place, we can see pretty clearly what they're trying to do.   They couldn't really care very much about interfering with collecting this one.

That would simply go to the point that well, you can't just call it a tax, because they've referred to it as a penalty.

As I read Bowles and John R.
