[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Gorsuch is participating remotely this morning. We will hear argument this morning in Case 20-843, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association versus Bruen. Mr. Clement. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of the Second Amendment enshrines a right not just to keep arms but to bear them, and the relevant history and tradition, exhaustively surveyed by this Court in the Heller decision, confirm that the text protects an individual right to carry firearms outside the home for purposes of self-defense. Indeed, that history is so clear that New York no longer contests that carrying a handgun outside of the home for purposes of self-defense is constitutionally protected activity.   But that concession dooms New York's law, which makes it a crime for a typical law-abiding New Yorker to exercise that constitutional right. This Court in Heller labeled the very few comparable laws that restricted all outlets for carrying firearms outside the home for self-defense outliers that were rightly condemned in decisions like Nunn against Georgia. New York likens its law to a restriction on weapons in sensitive places.   But the difference between a sensitive place law and New York's regime is fundamental.   It is the difference between regulating constitutionally protected activity and attempting to convert a fundamental constitutional right into a privilege that can only be enjoyed by those who can demonstrate to the satisfaction of a government official that they have an atypical need for the exercise of that right. That is not how constitutional rights work.   Carrying a firearm outside the home is a fundamental constitutional right.   It is not some extraordinary action that requires an extraordinary demonstration of need. Petitioners here seek nothing more than their fellow citizens in 43 other states already enjoy, and those states include some of the most populous cities in the country.   Those states, like New York, limit the firearms in sensitive places but do not prohibit carrying for self-defense in any location typically open to the general public. I'm happy to continue by point -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mr. Clement, sorry to interrupt you.   The -- if we analyze this and use history, tradition, the text of the Second Amendment, we're going to have to do it by analogy. So can you give me a regulation in history that is a base -- that would form a basis for legitimate regulation today? If we're going to do it by analogy, what would we analogize it to? What would that look like? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I suppose, if you're going to reason by analogy, then you could, you know, go back and you could find analogous restrictions relatively early in our nation's history about prohibiting certain types of firearms or having firearms in -- or any weapon, really, in certain sensitive locations, and I think you could reason in that way. Here, I think the reasoning works the opposite direction, which is you typically have a baseline right to carry for self-defense, and the only historical analogs that really restricted the right of a typical law-abiding citizen to carry for self-defense to the same degree as the New York law here were those laws, very few, typically post-Reconstruction laws that purported to eliminate any right to carry, openly or concealed.   And those court -- those -- those laws were essentially invalidated by every court that was applying an individual rights view of the Second Amendment. And those decisions, of course, were exhaustively considered by this Court in Heller. And those decisions were praised for their understanding of the Second Amendment and the relationship between the prefatory clause and the operative clause. And, equally important, the -- those laws were set forth by this Court and singled out by this Court as the very few restrictions historically that were comparable to what the District of Columbia was doing in Heller. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So if we look at the -- you mentioned the founding and you mentioned post-Reconstruction.   But, if we are to analyze this based upon the history or tradition, should we look at the founding, or should we look at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, which then, of course, applies it to the states? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Thomas, I suppose, if there were a case where there was a contradiction between those two, you know, and the case arose in the states, I would think there would be a decent argument for looking at the history at the time of Reconstruction as -- you know, and -- and -- and giving preference to that over the founding. I think, for this case and for Heller and I think for most of the cases that will arise, I don't know that the original founding history is going to be radically different from that at Reconstruction. But I guess what I would say is I do think that's about where it stops, because the point here isn't to look at history for the sake of studying history.   The point is to look at the history that's relevant for understanding the original public meaning of the Second Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Clement, how could it stop there? In Heller, we made very clear that laws that restricted felons from carrying or possessing arms and laws that forbade mentally ill people from doing the same -- we, you know, basically put the stamp of approval on those laws.   And those laws really came about in the 1920s, didn't they? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " You know, Justice Kagan, I -- I -- I think some of those laws in their current form took that shape in the 1920s, but I also think there was a tradition from the beginning for keeping certain people outside of the group of people that were eligible for possession of firearms. I -- you know, I think, obviously, there is a different tradition with respect to felons, in part, because, you know, you start at the time of the framing, and most felonies are capital crimes.   So, you know, the -- the -- the need to disenfranchise felons for firearm possession was a little different at the framing.   So I think you do need to make those kind of adjustments, but I think those adjustments can be made. I think, really, there are two reasons to at least be skeptical of post-1871 history. I mean, the first is I just don't really understand why it's terribly relevant in forming the original public meaning of the Constitution. But, of course, the second reason is it's just about that time that the collective rights view started to creep into the decisions of some state supreme courts. And I think -- so in Heller is a perfect example that this Court didn't absolutely stop its analysis in 1871, but, when it looked at those later sort of postbellum state supreme court decisions, the ones that relied on a collective rights view were given very short shrift.   And I think that's the appropriate way to sort of deal with these historical analogs. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, I have two -- two questions.   One -- one is on history.   I mean, it's law office history.   In McDonald, we had professors of history ran departments in the English Civil War and they all said the history in Heller was wrong. You've read the briefs here.   I don't know.   You read the briefs of the historian of the Air Force, and she says it's this way and the other ones say it's the other way.   How are we supposed to deal with that? There's a good case -- this is a wonderful case for showing both sides.   So I'm not sure how to deal with the history. And my other question is I'm not sure what New York does.   We're talking here about outside New York City.   New York says we have about 90,000 licenses to carry concealed weapons or maybe it's 40,000 or maybe it's 10,000.   But there's been no trial.   There's been no proceeding.   All it is is dismissed law in the -- so -- so -- so how are we supposed to find out, A, what the history is, which is my minor question, really -- there's a lot of debate on that -- but, second, how are we supposed to know what we're talking about in terms of what New York does since they say they give thou -- including to one of your clients, they give a license to carry a concealed weapon? So there are concealed weapon licenses all over the place. So -- so what are we supposed to do about those two things? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, Justice Breyer, let me start with the major question, which is -- because I think that's actually very straightforwardly answered -- which is there's no serious question about the experience of the individual Petitioners in this case. And they both sought unrestricted licenses and they were both denied unrestricted licenses, notwithstanding that they satisfy every other requirement that the state has to be licensed for a concealed carry. And so I'm happy to debate why the state statistics don't really prove anything particularly relevant, but I think they're irrelevant for a more fundamental reason.   I mean, you know, if there were a debate between the parties about whether 95 percent or 90 percent of the citizens of New York were denied their confrontation rights in criminal trials, but you had before you two individuals who were clearly denied the right to confront the witnesses against them, you wouldn't worry about the other 95 percent -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I have to say -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- or the other -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- 90 percent. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- that's not really the way your brief is written.   The way your brief is written is to say, you know, this is a -- a -- a -- a regulatory scheme that deprives most people of the right to carry arms in self-defense.   And your brief puts a lot of emphasis on that, like don't believe the state that they are going to really take seriously people's need for self-defense because they always reject these licenses. You know, if you had a bunch of statistics which suggest that the state is quite sensitive to people's need for self-defense and gives these licenses a significant amount of the time, you might think differently about the regulatory scheme, wouldn't you? I mean, that's the way your brief reads to me. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, Justice Kagan, two points. One is I wouldn't feel any differently with respect to my two individual clients, who were denied their right to exercise their Second Amendment rights. But, more broadly, the reason I'm so confident that this regime is problematic on its face is because, on its face, at least as interpreted by the highest court in New York, the requirement you need to show in order to carry concealed for self-defense but not for hunting and target practice is you have to show that you have a need for self-defense that distinguishes you from the generalized community, from the general community. So New York's law on its face says that the only way that you can carry for self-defense is if you demonstrate your atypicality with respect to your need for self-defense.   And that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So what do they say? Because, look, Mr. Koch can.   He has his license.   He can carry it for self-defense under the license to and from work and, as you say, can carry it for hunting, target practice, et cetera, concealed, and in your opinion, is it supposed to say you can carry a concealed gun around the streets or the town or outside just for fun? I mean, they are dangerous, guns.   I mean, so what's it supposed to say? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " It's -- it's supposed to be what New York says that they give to lots of applicants at least in other counties, which is an unrestricted license, which basically means that somebody who has demonstrated to the state that they're of good moral character, that they have all the necessary training, whatever the state requires -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So 40,000 -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- whatever the state -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- or 50,000 or 60,000 is not enough.   You have to show you have a good moral character, and then, if you just would like to carry a concealed weapon, which is a dangerous thing, as I said, you can just do it, just that's what the Fourth -- that's -- in your opinion, that's what you want, no restrictions? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, certainly, New York is entitled to have laws that say that you can't have weapons in sensitive places, in addition to whatever regulation -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, no, I'm not saying -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- for carrying that. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Right, right.   I'm not saying that. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And -- and -- and New York has those laws, and we don't challenge those.   What we would -- what we're asking for -- I mean, one way to think about it is we're asking that the regime work the same way for self-defense as it does for hunting. When my clients go in and ask for a license to concealed carry for hunting purposes, what they have to tell the state is they have an intent to go hunting.   They don't have to say: I have a really good reason to go hunting.   I don't have to say I have a better reason to go hunting than anybody else in my general community.   And it's there -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah.   Well, the difference, of course, you have a concealed weapon to go hunting.   You're out with an intent to shoot, say, a deer or a rabbit, which has its problems.   But, here, when you have a self-defense just for whatever you want to carry a concealed weapon, you go shooting it around and somebody gets killed. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " With respect, Justice Breyer, that's not been the experience in the 43 jurisdictions that allow their citizens to have the same rights that my -- my clients are looking for.   This is not something where we're asking you to take some brave new experiment that no jurisdiction in Anglo-American history have -- have -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- have ever done. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- may I -- you're talking about 43 other jurisdictions.   And I suspect that when we get into those 43 other jurisdictions that there are going to be a handful that are identical. The one thing that I've looked at in this history is the plethora of regimes that states pick, and that starts in English law, through the colonies, through post-Constitution, to post-Civil War, to the 19th Century, to even now, those 43 states that you're talking about, most of them didn't give unrestricted rights to carry in one form or another until recent times. Before recent times, there were so many different regulations.   What it appears to me is that the history tradition of carrying weapons is that states get a lot of deference on this.   And the one deference that you don't -- haven't addressed is the question presented is what's the law with respect to concealed weapons. In 1315, the British Parliament specifically banned the carrying of concealed arms.   In colonial America, at least four, if not five, states restricted concealed arms. After the Civil War, there were many, many more states, some include it in their constitution, that you can have a right to arms but not concealed. You can go to Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana, which are now more open -- are more free in granting the right to carry guns, but they prohibited through their history concealed weapons, the carrying of concealed weapons. It seems to me that if we're looking at that history and tradition with respect to concealed arms that there is not the same requirement that there is in the home. One of the things Heller pointed to was there were few regulations that prohibited the carrying or the keeping of arms in homes. But that's not true with respect to the regulations about keeping of arms outside of homes. Putting aside the -- the prohibitions, regulations on sensitive places, regulations on the types of people, it seems to me that I don't know how I get past all that history -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- without you sort of making it up and saying there's a right to control states that has never been exercised in the entire history of the United States as to how far they can go in saying this poses a danger. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Sotomayor, there's a lot to that question.   I'll try to take it, you know, sequentially if I can. I mean, you know, let's start with concealed carry restrictions.   I mean, it is true that during time periods where open carry was allowed that some states did specifically restrict concealed carry on the precise theory that if we allow you to carry open, then, if you're carrying concealed, you're probably up to no good. And Heller did exhaustively survey those cases, and what it concluded is that if a state allows open carry, then it can prohibit concealed carry, I suppose vice versa, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But you're asking us to make the choice for the legislature. We're only looking at concealed here. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " We are not asking you to make that, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, yeah, you are, because you're conditioning history on a different fact. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I don't think we're asking to -- for anybody to make that choice. In fact, the relief we've asked for is to have an unrestricted license because, under New York law as it currently exists, that's the only way that you can have a carry right for a handgun. But, in framing our relief in the complaint, we, you know, framed it so that there are other relief consistent with the decision. So, if New York really wanted to say, you know, no, we have a particular problem with concealed carry, notwithstanding that traditionally that's the only way we allow people to carry, if they want to shift to an open carry regime, they could do that consistent with everything we've said here. Now I don't think anybody expects that to happen because, if you look at the New York law specifically, it's a law that prohibits the carrying of handguns except for permit holders, and then its provisions about permit holders speak specifically to concealed carry. So that's why we've framed our request the way we have.   But what we're doing, I think, is completely consistent with the majority decision in Heller's analysis of the historical cases.   We've said that those very few states that tried to prohibit both concealed carry and open carry and so gave no outlet for the right to carry a firearm for self-defense outside the home, those were the laws that the Heller majority identified as being analogous to the D.C. restriction in Heller that was invalidated. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I do know that many of the laws conditioned or retained the right of the state to decide which people were eligible.   And the historians -- to carry the arms, that you had to be subject to the approval of the local sheriff or the local mayor, et cetera.   And during the Civil War, that was used to -- to deny Black people the right to hold arms.   We now have the Fourteenth Amendment to protect that. But why is a good cause requirement any different than that discretion that was given to local officials to deny the carrying of firearms to people that they thought it was inappropriate, whether it was the mentally ill or any other qualification? I -- that's how I see the good cause as fitting in -- within that tradition. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So -- so let me make a point about how it's so different from that tradition, but then also let me make a historical point. This -- it's radically different to say that if you are a typical New Yorker, so you qualify -- you satisfy every other qualification, you're not a felon, you don't have any mental health problems, you've done everything else we've asked you, but you are typical in the sense that you don't have an atypical need to carry for self-defense, I don't think there's any historical analog to that. As to the historical examples, with all due respect, I -- I don't think I read the surety laws the same way that you do.   Those surety laws, which were only in -- in -- in place in a minority of jurisdictions, but, nonetheless, I think they help us because those surety laws, first of all, start with the proposition that there's a baseline right for every person, every member of the people, protected by the Second Amendment, to carry. And what they do is, if somebody, essentially, as a complainant, can come into court and say that somebody is -- has a propensity to use them in an offensive or violent way, then, if you satisfy a neutral fact-finder, then you don't automatically get to disarm that person.   You put them to the choice of posting a surety, and then they can continue to possess their firearm. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Clement, you -- in your opening, you talked about the right applying in any location typically open to the general public. I'd like to get some sense about what you believe could be off limits, like university campuses.   Could they say you're not allowed to carry on a university campus? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think the answer to your question is yes. And I think that what I would say, though, first of all, is the language I was talking about, any location open to the general public, that's right from the license denial on Joint Appendix page 40 -- 41.   So that wasn't loose language on my part.   That's -- that's right there from where we are told, in capital letters, where we cannot carry, any location, all caps, typically open to -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, what sort of place do you think they could be excluded from? In other words, you can get a permit, but the state can impose certain restrictions, for example, any place in which alcohol is served. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Can they say you cannot carry your gun at any place where alcohol is served? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Mr. Chief Justice, I think you -- probably the right way to look at those cases would be look at them case by case and say, okay -- this Court in Heller, for example, said sensitive places include government buildings and schools.   I think those, you can probably tap into a pretty good tradition. I think any place that served alcohol would be a -- a -- a -- a -- you know, a tougher case for the government.   I think we would have a stronger case.   They might be able to condition the license holder on not consuming any alcohol.   There might be a variety of laws. And we could have those debates, but -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What about a football stadium? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I -- I -- I think, again, football stadium, you probably take it on its own and -- and look to the historical analogs.   But here's -- I guess, if I could offer some general principles, I think there's two principles. One is, you know, restriction of access to the place is something that I think would be consistent with the way government buildings have worked and schools have worked. Not any member of the general public can come in there.   They restrict access.   With -- with or without a gun, if you're an adult that has no business to be in a school, you're excluded.   So I think that's a factor that would support treating that as a sensitive place. A second principle that I would offer is these sensitive place restrictions really are a different animal than a carry restriction because I think a true sensitive place restriction is not just going to limit your ability to carry concealed, but it's going to be, say, this is a place where no weapons are allowed.   You know, whether they're firearms or other weapons, no weapons are allowed. And then the third point that I would say -- and this is just an analogy, but I think it's a useful analogy -- is I think the way to think about this is a little like the nonpublic forum doctrine in the First Amendment, which is you -- you start with the place and you try to understand is this a place where, given the nature of the place, its function, its restrictions on access, that weapons are out of place? And, if so, that's probably a sensitive place -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So -- but -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D.

If it's a -- if it's a place like a courthouse, for example, a government building, where everybody has to go through a magnetometer and there are security officials there, that would qualify as a sensitive place.

So that's one place to look. The other place that I think you would find some -- some -- something persuasive there is their own amicus brief on their side by the City of Chicago, because the City of Chicago is in a shall issue jurisdiction, and the City of Chicago goes on to sort of, you know, essentially brag about all of the ways that they've done, consistent with that regime, to reduce crime in Chicago that probably doesn't have a direct analog in downstate Illinois.

So I'm thinking, like, if you look to the history, you end up with a completely different set of rules from the ones that you're suggesting with respect to concealed versus open.   And it's a -- it's an example, I think, of -- of the difficulties of looking to history, where people were operating on such different, to use your term, wavelengths. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D.

Do you look to the 1920s when all these felon laws were passed, as well as public purpose laws of exactly the same kind as New York. So one question is, how far up do you look? Another question is, you know, with what sense of flexibility do you look? And I think that this is an example of that.   It's like, no, we're not going to ask for an exact analog because we realize that the world has changed and regulatory schemes are very different because regulatory interests are very different. If we tried to copy history, we would find ourselves in a world in which the only thing that a state could do is tell people, you know, you can't carry it concealed, you have to carry it open. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Kagan, let me give you an example of how I think the Court should use history in this context, and I'll go exactly to the Georgia statute that was at issue in Nunn against Georgia.   Now that was a statute that, on its face, prohibited carrying simpliciter.   So it didn't say open.   It didn't say concealed. Now the court that analyzed that reversed -- vacated the indictment of somebody under the statute because the statute didn't specify and they didn't think that person had carried concealed, but when they looked at it, they interpreted it in light of the context at the time and they thought, boy, it is not consistent with the Second Amendment that Georgia actually -- that court actually thought directly applied to the state, which is interesting, but -- but they said that's not consistent with the Second Amendment to prohibit any means for carrying. Then, consistent with kind of the norms of the time, kind of almost as like a severability holding, dare I say it, they said, well, all right, the open carry, that's allowed. I mean, rather, that's -- that's -- we're going to say that to the extent this statute prohibits open carry, that's unconstitutional, but to the extent that it prohibits concealed carry, that's constitutional. Now the -- the -- the fundamental problem with the law that carries over as a direct analogy is it gave no outlet to exercise the constitutional right to carry for self-defense.   The norms of the time had a favoring for open carry over concealed.   I will grant you that the norms of the time have flipped, and, certainly, in New York, based on the rest of their licensing regime, I assume that they would prefer that my client -- clients carry concealed rather than openly. But I think that's the way you can use the history, and you can use it with some contextual sensitivity, but you cannot sort of, you know, throw it all out, because I do think the analogy is pretty clean between a law that prohibits any form of carry and what New York is doing here. And, of course, that was one of the laws that this Court specifically looked to in the Heller decision as well. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and when you look at this history in the properly contextual way, do you see no difference between the kind of regulation that was allowed in the home and the kind of regulation that was allowed in public places? Because it seems to me that the history -- and -- and Justice Sotomayor developed it at some length -- but the history is replete with that distinction, that the -- and, indeed, Heller recognizes that. Heller recognizes that the home is a very special place, both because -- you know, for similar reasons for the Fourth Amendment but also because the need for self-defense is so much greater there. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I -- I -- I think, in terms of -- I'm not going to tell you that the context doesn't matter at all.   I mean, take the sensitive places law, right? They just -- they don't really affect the keep right the way that they affect the carry right, unless you try to say the entirety of Manhattan is a sensitive place, and then they might affect both.   But, in general, the -- the analysis is going to be slightly different. But I would say that, you know, I don't think those differences are material here. I think, if the District, instead of just banning handguns inside the home, had adopted a permitting regime that required District residents to show that they had an atypical need to possess a handgun inside the home, I'm not sure anything in Heller would have been different because it's just inconsistent with a constitutional right to either ban the exercise of it or say that it's a privilege that you can only exercise if you show that you are atypical from the rest of the people who are equally protected by the constitutional right.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Great.   Some of your amici have asked us to provide further guidance to lower courts in cases beyond your own.   And so, putting aside your -- your case for the moment, they've pointed out that some lower courts have refused to apply the history test, for example, and said they will not extend Heller outside the home until this Court does. Other courts have applied intermediate scrutiny and variations of that.   Some have suggested that strict scrutiny would be appropriate to treat this right comparably to other rights under our modern tiers of scrutiny. I -- I -- I -- I'd just be curious what -- what -- what views you have about all that. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you, Justice Gorsuch.   I -- I think we would start with the idea that text, history, and tradition is an appropriate way to deal with this right.   That's what the Court said in Heller. I think this Court would allow the Court to make clear that the same analysis applies outside of the home.   And I think this case, like Heller, is such an outlier that the Court wouldn't have to say too much more unless it wanted to. I think, if it wanted to, though, it would already, I think, go a long way to correcting some of the mistakes in the lower court to say that text, history, and tradition is the test, not part of the test but the test inside and outside the home. And if this Court prefers to go the level of scrutiny route, I would simply say two things.   One, we would prefer strict scrutiny as being consistent with a fundamental constitutional right.   But, even if it's going to be intermediate scrutiny, probably the single-most important thing to remind the lower courts is that intermediate scrutiny requires narrow tailoring. And a law like this that takes a person who has no proclivity whatsoever, unlike the surety laws, to misuse firearms and says you simply can't carry them for self-defense anywhere frequented by the public because you haven't demonstrated an atypical need, I mean, that's about as untailored a law as I can imagine. So I think, if you did one of those two things -- either make clear that it's text, history, and tradition outside the home as well as inside or made clear that narrow tailoring is an integral component of the test -- that would go a long way to clearing up some of the confusion in the lower courts.

We haven't heard about that today, and I just wanted to give you a chance. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you, Justice Gorsuch.   I'd say just a couple of quick things about the Statute of Northampton. First of all, I think that it was very clear from the Knight's Case and the treatises that this Court relied on in Heller that by the time of the framing of the English Bill of Rights, that was not a general prohibition on carrying outside the home but was a prohibition on either carrying unusual and dangerous weapons or using common weapons in a way that terrorized the public.   And so I don't think that that supports the other side's position here. And the second thing I would say is that probably the single-most obvious point about the history is there just are no reported cases on this side of the Atlantic, not in actual reporters, not in newspaper reports about crimes of the day, that show anybody being prosecuted for a violation of the Northampton crime simply by carrying common firearms for self-defense. And the one U.S. early court that dealt with this, the common law equivalent of the statute, was State against Huntly in North Carolina, which was an opinion that was cited favorably in the majority opinion in Heller, and that case went out of its way to say that simply carrying firearms per se is not an offense; it's the intent to terrorize the people that is prohibited by Northampton.

Kavanaugh", "text": " Mr. Clement, I have several questions. First, I want to make sure I understand your main problem here with this permitting regime, as I understand it, is the discretion that's involved with the permitting officials, and your point that that's just not how we do constitutional rights, where we allow basic blanket discretion to grant or deny something for all sorts of reasons. But I understand you would not object or do not object to the regimes that are used in many of the other 42 states, the shall issue regimes.   I mean, there could be particular problems with those, but I do not understand you to object to shall issue regimes. Is that accurate? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " That's accurate, Justice Kavanaugh.   And as you say, they're the -- you know, especially if you have something like good moral character, there is the possibility for discretionary abuse in those regimes as well. But the thrust of this case is, you know, we -- we'd like what they're having.   We'd like what the people in the other 43 states are allowed to do and exercise their rights, and in many of those states, it's shall issue. And -- and that is, of course -- you know, New York purports to have effectively a shall issue regime with respect to hunting.   The only other caveat I wanted to add is it's the discretion combined with the atypicality requirement. So, if they came up with some, you know, sort of, like, magic wand that gave them a precise reading of typicality, and so there was no discretion, but the standard was still at the end of the day you have to show that you are atypical from the rest of the people protected by the Second Amendment, we would have a problem with that as well. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Right.   A shall issue regime with an atypicality requirement would be no good in your view? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Even if it could be somehow if you could come up with some objective standard of typicality. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.   And the issue before us, as I understand it, is the permitting regime.   We don't have to answer all the sensitive places questions in this case, some of which will be challenging no doubt, is that accurate? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " That's 100 percent accurate.   And it's -- so there's sort of a market test of the accuracy of that, which is New York does have sensitive place laws, and we have not challenged them in this litigation. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And then, to follow up on Justice Thomas's question and also Justice Gorsuch's, we should focus on American law and the text of the Constitution and we don't start the analysis in a vacuum, but we start it with the text, which you say grants a right to carry, and then historical practice can justify certain kinds of regulations, but the baseline is always the right established in the text.   And there will be tough questions, as the questions -- arguments revealed, about what the historical practice shows, but the default or baseline is the text, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " That -- that -- that's absolutely right, Justice Kavanaugh.   And, of course, that's no different from something like the First Amendment, where, of course, you start with the text, and it's very emphatic text, you know, no law abridging speech, but then you look to history and tradition just to realize, oh, well, there's a long tradition of treating defamation and libel different going back to the framing, so you use that history to inform the text, but the focus is on the text. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And last question, following up on Justice Gorsuch's question, is he points out some courts have used intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny.   You know, those are balancing tests.   I think Professor Alicea's amicus brief is very helpful on that.   There's well-developed law in other areas. But it'll be no surprise to you I have concern that that would just be a balancing test that would leave -- make it a policy judgment basically for the courts. And I don't know why we would -- you say you'd be okay with that, but I'm not sure why we would smuggle all that into here and then it would just be a policy judgment that would be unanchored from the historical practice. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Kavanaugh, two points just in response to that. One, you know, as -- as you articulate the concerns with interesting balancing, that might be a reason that if you're going to go with the level of scrutiny's approach, you would go to strict scrutiny, where I just think there's less play in the joints. But the second -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, I mean, maybe.   But what's a compelling interest? Do you have a compelling -- there's a lot of play in the joints in -- in some of the other areas, so I don't know that you want to open that door. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And -- and -- and -- and the second point I was going to make, though, Justice Kavanaugh, which is maybe more consonant with the thrust of the question is, you know, whatever was the case in Heller, where I -- I sort of read the majority opinion as actually already rejecting interesting balancing, but whatever was the case in Heller, you know, we now have this 13 years of experience with lower courts applying the test. And in -- in our view, you know, they've made a muddle of it and the -- you know, it's -- it's probably -- the experience of the last 13 years is probably a very good reason to prefer a text, history, and tradition approach to this area of the law.

"}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Clement, I have one question. So a couple times, in response to my question about Times Square and New Year's Eve and then just now as well to Justice Kavanaugh, you made reference to the First Amendment.   And, obviously, a lot of the questions that have been asked have been focused on how do we -- how can the state fairly regulate, because everybody agrees there have to be some regulations, and it might not be the case that we can always find exact historical analogs, so we're turning to the First Amendment. In response to me, you said, well, that might be analogous to a time, place, and manner restriction.   So do you think the First Amendment and the, you know, edifices that we have structured around it would be a helpful place to look? Is that what you're suggesting? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I'm suggesting that there is a lot of useful teaching in the First Amendment.   I'm not sure I'm suggesting you should just take sort of doctrines lock, stock, and barrel from the First Amendment. But, you know, I mean, going back, you know, well over a hundred years to, like, Robertson, when the Court was just talking in dictum about the First and the Second Amendment, it drew the analogy between allowing some restrictions on the Second Amendment and, in the First Amendment context, the First Amendment being consistent with libel and defamation. As I suggested to the Chief Justice, I think the way you think about a nonpublic forum and why that's different from First Amendment purposes from a park, I think, could be useful in some of these contexts. You know, if you focus on the nature of the location, you might say this is inappropriate for weapons.   But, in the same way as in the First Amendment, you just don't get to say, well, we're going to make it a nonpublic forum by saying no First Amendment activity there.   You can't just take a location and say we're going to make this a sensitive place by saying no Second Amendment activity there. So those kind of analogies, and, lastly, the analogy being you look at a law that says no concealed carry in a particular place on one night of the year quite differently from a law like this that says there's really no way for a typical New Yorker to conceal carry anywhere that the general public is allowed to go. Those -- under the First Amendment, those are radically different laws, and I think, under the Second Amendment, those are radically different laws. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. General Underwood. "}, {"speaker": "Barbara D. Underwood", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For centuries, English and American law have imposed limits on carrying firearms in public in the interest of public safety.   The history runs from the 14th Century statute of Northampton, which prohibited carrying arms in fairs and markets and other public gathering places, to similar laws adopted by half of the American colonies and states in the founding period, to later state laws that relaxed restrictions for people who had a concrete need for armed self-defense. Starting as early as the early 1800s, states began taking different approaches to regulating firearm-carrying in public.   Some states provided that a person who carried firearms in public without reasonable cause could be arrested and required to post a bond. Other states made it a misdemeanor to carry a handgun without reasonable grounds to fear an attack. Other states and territories began -- banned carrying handguns in towns and cities altogether or restricted it to situations of immediate threat.   And in the early 1900s, many states made good cause a requirement for a license to carry a concealed handgun while also prohibiting in some cases the open carrying of handguns. In total, from the founding era through the 20th Century, at least 20 states have at one time or another either prohibited all carrying of handguns in populous areas or limited it to those with good cause. New York's law fits well within that tradition of regulating public carry.   It makes a carry license available to any person not disqualified who has a non-speculative reason to carry a handgun for self-defense. New York is not an outlier in the extent to which the state restricts the ability to carry firearms in public, and it's not an outlier in asking a licensed applicant to show good cause for a carry license. Many ordinary people have received carry licenses in New York State.   If the Court has questions about how the law works in practice, it should remand for fact-finding, and if the Court finds the history ambiguous, it should review the law under intermediate scrutiny and uphold it. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " General Underwood, you seem to rely a bit on the density of the population.   You say, I think, that states like New York have high-density areas.

So, when you are -- when you suggest that, how rural does the area have to be before your restrictions shouldn't apply? "}, {"speaker": "Barbara D. Underwood", "text": " Well, I -- I think the way the New York statute works is consistent with a reasonable rule, which is that there's not a cutoff, there's not a number at which things change, but that licenses -- unrestricted licenses are much more readily available in more -- in less densely populated upstate counties than they are in dense metropolitan areas. And that is a virtue of the system of having licenses handled by licensing officers who are part of the local community and who take the density of population into account, as well as the -- many other factors. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, the -- Mr. Nash lives in a -- quite a low-density area.   That's why I'm interested in where your cutoff is.

On the other hand, there are places in a -- in a densely populated city where it's more likely that that's where you're going to need a gun for self-defense and, you know, however many policemen are assigned, that, you know, there are high-crime areas. And it seems to me that what you're saying is that's probably the last place that someone's going to get a permit to carry a gun. How is that -- regardless of what we think of the policy of that, how is that consistent with Heller's reasoning that the reason the Second Amendment applies a -- a direct personal right is for self-defense? "}, {"speaker": "Barbara D. Underwood", "text": " Well, I'll say a couple of things about that. One, we -- if you go right to history and tradition, the history was to regulate most strenuously in densely populated places.   That's what fairs and markets are.   So we have history. But we also have a rationale for that history, which is that where there is dense population, there is also the deterrent of lots of people and there is the availability of law enforcement.   In -- in England, the idea was that it was the King's Peace and it was, in fact, an insult to the king for people to take things into their own hands and -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

But it's a -- it's -- it's a hard thing to -- to match with our notion of constitutional rights generally.

This is a -- this is an interactive process in which these individuals and others are told I'm not going to lift the restrictions now, but if you come back, if you have more to -- to say about this, you know, feel free to come back. It's an ongoing process.   It's one reason why there isn't so much appellate litigation, is that it is -- is that that is what happens. So it's hard to see how you could specify everything in advance and have it be a clear on/off switch and still take adequate account of, on the one hand, the need for self-defense and, on the other hand, the strong public safety concerns.

We have a strong history here of a range of responses from state to state that is based on local conditions and local concerns. And what we have within New York is an effort to recognize we have the same -- almost the same range of different kinds of spaces within the state, and this is the effort to accommodate that. And if the history warrants taking local conditions and local population density and so forth into account, it's hard to think of another way to -- to effectively do that.

As Justice Alito said, there's a lot of history floating around this morning, and so I want to be clear that, when I say that, I am putting to the side all of the disputed bits about the Statute of Northampton, about the surety laws, and I'm putting to the side laws that restricted concealed carry but do not restrict open carry, and I am focusing on laws that either prohibited or required a showing of good cause to carry a concealable weapon, like a pistol. Tennessee enacted one of those laws in 1821.   Texas followed in 1871.   New Mexico and Arkansas likewise enacted such laws in the years immediately after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.   And over the decades that followed, more than a dozen other states enacted other laws that were at least as restrictive as New York's.   Like my friends from New York, I count about 20 laws in total that fit that description. Those laws remain in force in seven states today, and more than 80 million Americans live under their protection.   They are, in short, both traditional and common regulations. I'd welcome the Court's questions or I'm happy to continue. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " How do we determine which states we should look to?

Fletcher", "text": " I agree, Justice Thomas, and I think there might be reason to be skeptical about a tradition that's only reflected in one state. I think that's a problem for Mr. Clement in relying on some of the cases exclusively from the antebellum south.   But the cases that we're relying on come from the south, like the Tennessee, Arkansas, and Texas law I described.   West Virginia had a similar law, as did Alabama, New York, Massachusetts, California, Hawaii. The tradition that I am drawing on spans two centuries going back to the Tennessee law, spans 150 years when you broaden it out to many states, and spans all regions or virtually all regions of the country. So I think that's the sort of tradition that you can look to when defining a national tradition of gun regulation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I mean, what is the appropriate analysis? I mean, you sort of -- we -- we, I think, generally don't reinvent the wheel.   I mean, the first thing I would look to in answering this question is not the Statute of Northampton, it's Heller, and Heller has gone through all this stuff and, obviously, in a somewhat different context, although that's part of the debate, self-defense at home.   You know, this is different. But I still think that you have to begin with -- with Heller and its recognition that the Second Amendment, you know, it -- it has its own limitations, but it is to be interpreted the same way you'd interpret other provisions of the Constitution. And I wonder what your best answer is to the point that Mr. Clement makes in his brief, which is that, for example, if you're asserting a claim to confront the witnesses against you under the Constitution, you don't have to say I've got a special reason, this is why I think it's important to my -- my defense. The Constitution gives you that right. And if someone's going to take it away from you, they have to justify it.   You don't have to say when you're looking for a permit to speak on a street corner or whatever that, you know, your speech is particularly important. So why do you have to show in this case, convince somebody, that you're entitled to exercise your Second Amendment right? "}, {"speaker": "Brian H. Fletcher", "text": " So let me start with the general question and then get to that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Brian H. Fletcher", "text": " -- specific point for Mr. Clement. As to the general question about Heller, we agree completely that the Court ought to apply the method from Heller, which we, like I think all the parties, take to be look to the text, history, and tradition of the Second Amendment right, and we're applying that now to a somewhat different issue with the benefit of somewhat broader materials. Now, as to the question about why you have to have a showing of need, I think the problem with Mr. Clement's formulation is that it assumes the conclusion. If you had a right, the Second Amendment conferred a right to carry around a weapon for possible self-defense just because an individual wants to have one available, then, obviously, you couldn't take away that right or make it contingent upon a discretionary determination. But the whole question is whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms confers that right to have a pistol with you for self-defense even absent a showing of demonstrated need. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I'm not sure that's right.   I mean, you would -- regardless of what the right is, it would be surprising to have it depend upon a permit system.   You can say that the right is limited in a particular way, just as First Amendment rights are limited, but the idea that you need a license to exercise the right, I think, is unusual in the context of the Bill of Rights. "}, {"speaker": "Brian H. Fletcher", "text": " So I -- I agree with that, but I think I heard even Mr. Clement in response to a question from Justice Kavanaugh say he doesn't have a quarrel with licensing regimes in general. And I think what that is one illustration of is that the Second Amendment has a distinct history and tradition and that the way to be faithful to the Second Amendment is to be faithful to that history and tradition and not to draw analogies to other rights with -- with their own histories and traditions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, there's licensing and there's licensing.

Fletcher", "text": " So we would ask that question by looking to the history and tradition of the Second Amendment.   And in Tennessee, in 1821, you couldn't carry a pistol at all.   In Texas, in 1871, you had to have a showing of need if you were going to carry a pistol. And that showing of need was actually much less favorable than the New York regime. In Texas, in West Virginia, and in Alabama, in those laws that we cite, need to carry a firearm was a need that you had to show when you were prosecuted for violating the law.   It was essentially a self-defense requirement.   And you had to persuade a jury in a criminal trial that you had an immediate pressing need to be carrying the gun when you were carrying it. The laws, of which New York's is one but by no means the only example that began to become more prevalent in the 20th Century, said we're going to make that determination of need ex ante.   We're going to require a showing of good cause. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Can -- "}, {"speaker": "Brian H. Fletcher", "text": " New York has done that for a century.   I'm sorry, Justice Kavanaugh. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " This might be a level of generality issue, but I think Mr. Clement responded to what -- some of what you're saying on history and tradition by saying you have to look at carry laws more generally.   And there was open carry traditions in a lot of those states. And so I think he followed up by saying so open carry is one option.   Shall carry permit regimes for concealed carry, another option.   But what you can't have is no open carry and simply a may issue discretionary regime that will, in practice, he says, limit the right. So can you respond to that? "}, {"speaker": "Brian H. Fletcher", "text": " Yeah.   I meant to be taking that into account in the history -- account of history that I'm giving you.   So the Tennessee laws refer specifically to carry publicly or privately.   Texas, the same story. If I were here defending a regime that just prohibited concealed carry and allowed open carry, I would have many, many, many more states.   But I'm focused on just this type of law, and even there, our submission is there's a substantial history and tradition of that kind of regulation.   It's not the sort of outlier that the Court confronted in Heller and McDonald. And if I -- I could speak to -- Mr. Clement has spoken some about the case law from the 19th Century and has suggested that laws like these were struck down.   And with all respect to my friend, that's not correct. The cases that he is relying on are primarily dicta.   The two cases he has that actually struck down laws -- or, I'm sorry, the three cases that he has that actually struck down laws are the Nunn decision from Georgia, which struck down a law that was -- banned even the keeping of pistols.   The Court did say in dicta that open carry was required, but that would -- that would -- the law was actually much more restrictive than that. The Andrews case that he relies on and that Heller relies on as well is actually more helpful to us because the Court upheld a prohibition on the carrying of belt or pocket pistols, and it prohibited a ban on revolvers only because the Court construed that ban to be so broad that it would prohibit even carrying it around your house. And in the very next sentence, the Court said: But, of course, the legislature, if it wanted to, could regulate the carrying of that firearm publicly. And then, when you turn to laws like the ones that we have here, which include some sort of self-defense exception, either ex-ante or ex-post, the trend in the cases is in favor of -- of upholding their constitutionality. We've cited about six decisions from the 1800s and the early 1900s, including the Duke and English cases from Texas, the Isaiah case from Alabama, the Haley and Fife cases from Arkansas, and the Workman case from West Virginia, all of which upheld those laws. And Mr. Clement's answer to those decisions is that they rested on the erroneous understanding that the Second Amendment or its state equivalents protected only the right to use arms in the militia. But that is not what those cases say. They do not stop by saying that the defendants were not militiamen and so had no rights.   The Texas cases in particular, in Duke and English, say that the law makes all necessary allowances for self-defense by including the type of -- of exception we described earlier. And so our submission is that that body of case law that New York law carries forward is part of our nation's history and tradition of firearms regulation and that New York ought to be allowed to continue to make the choice that it has made. Now we understand, and there's force to Mr. Clement's argument, that other states have made other choices.   Justice Alito made powerful points about how some individuals have a powerful claim to have a gun for self-defense. But the question before the Court is, of all of the different approaches to these difficult issues that states and other jurisdictions have taken over our nation's history, is this one that the Second Amendment takes off the table? And our submission is that when it's an option that New York has and other states have had for a century or more and that traces as far back as some of the laws that I've been discussing into our nation's history, that's an option that is consistent with our tradition of gun regulation and is an option that ought to be available to the states.

"}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I think one more question about the major point that you've made this morning, which is that there are scattered statutes, local ordinances, judicial decisions from various points in the 19th Century extending into the 20th Century, the early 20th Century, with the Sullivan Law and the other laws that you mentioned that are inconsistent with Mr. Clement's argument. But what does that show about the original understanding of the right that's protected by the Second Amendment? Would -- would we be receptive to arguments like that if we were interpreting, let's say, the First Amendment or the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment? Would we say, well, you know, you can find a lot of state laws and state court decisions from the late -- from the 19th Century, early 20th Century, that are inconsistent with a claim that is made based on the original meaning of -- of a provision of the Bill of Rights, and that shows that that's what that was understood to mean at the time? "}, {"speaker": "Brian H. Fletcher", "text": " Well, Justice Alito, I think Heller was receptive to those types of arguments and conducted a review of history through the 20th Century and rightly so, I think.   It's not unusual to look to the nation's tradition to understand the meaning of constitutional rights.   I think that's especially appropriate here for a couple of reasons. One is that I think everyone agrees that the right codified in the Second Amendment is a right that is subject to some reasonable regulations, and in deciding what regulations are reasonable, we think the fact that they've been prevalent throughout our history is a good sign that they are.   We think that's especially so because of a point that this Court made in McDonald, which is that throughout the nation's history, this is a right that's been recognized and codified in state constitutions as well. It's not something that people were not aware of. And so the fact that this type of regulation coexisted for so long with that understanding, we think, is a particularly strong indication of its consistency. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, Heller -- and -- and I will stop after this -- Heller cited decisions going into the 19th Century as confirmation of what it had already concluded based on text and history at or before the time of the adoption of the Second Amendment and said this is what it was understood to mean at the time and it's further evidence that this is what this right was understood to mean because it kept being reaffirmed by decisions that came after. But I find it hard to understand how later decisions and statutes, particularly when you start to get into the late 19th Century and the early 20th Century, can be used as a substitute for evidence about what the right was understood to mean in 1791 or 1868 if you think that's the relevant date. "}, {"speaker": "Brian H. Fletcher", "text": " So you're certainly right about the way that Heller looked to decisions to -- on its core holding of does the Second Amendment protect only a militia-focused right or an individual right. But, when Heller turned to the question presented here, which is what sorts of regulations are consistent with the right that it was recognizing, I think it's fairly read to extend the analysis into the 20th Century for the reason that Justice Kagan identified, that it validated as presumptively lawful felon-in-possession requirements, bans on the possession of firearms by the mentally ill that date to much later than the 19th Century.

I -- I think what -- the lesson from Heller, though, is that you don't need to apply strict scrutiny or any other level of scrutiny because those are the types of regulations that are validated by our nation's history and tradition of gun regulations.

Fletcher", "text": " So we don't quarrel at all with the notion that the Second Amendment has something to say outside the home.   Our submission is just that to understand how it applies outside the home, one has to look to the history and tradition of regulations. And what we've tried to argue in our brief and this morning is that there is a substantial history and tradition of the regulation of the public carrying of concealable weapons, including pistols, because of the dangers that they present and that regulations of that type, of which New York's is one, are consistent with the right recognized in the Second Amendment.

But let me give you a couple of guideposts.   I think there is a tradition of laws like the Tennessee law that I alluded to earlier and others that prohibit the carrying of concealable weapons without any exception for self-defense or -- or any good cause exception like the one that you have in the New York law. So we think, and -- and Judge Bybee for the en banc Ninth Circuit concluded after an exhaustive historical analysis, that those types of regulations are consistent with the Second Amendment.

What I can tell you is that we do share the concern behind the New York law, which is the concern that having more guns on the street does escalate -- does complicate and increase the danger inherent in citizen/law enforcement encounters.   We do think that's a real concern and it's one of a number of real concerns that are reflected in the law that New York has.

The lower courts seem very divided over how to approach Second Amendment questions. Some apply the text and history approach to the challenge before them.   Others say, yes, text and history is appropriate, but we're not going to extend the Heller right until and unless the Court first does so through its own text and history analysis.   We're not going to do it ourselves.   Others have applied intermediate scrutiny.   Others have applied what might be described as a watered down version of immediate -- intermediate scrutiny.

We take that approach to be consistent with the approach described by Justice Kavanaugh in his dissent in Heller II.   I think the one place where we might differ from him a little bit is that we think there may come a point, especially as -- when courts confront new regulations, where history gives out, where it's not possible to draw those historical analogies anymore. And at that point, our suggestion is that the way to be faithful to history and tradition is to look to the broader method that you find in that history and tradition.   And the method that we find in a half dozen or so cases from the mid-1800s that we cite is to ask whether the law is a reasonable regulation.   And as we explained in our brief, we think that the modern judicial method that is most faithful to that approach is a form of intermediate scrutiny.

Mr. Fletcher, appreciate your focus on history and tradition and want to explore that and get your thoughts on one thing.   As you say, there is a history and tradition, and it exists to the present day, of permitting regimes, and so the issue before us will have effects, but it's a narrow legal issue of \"shall issue\" versus \"may issue.\" And it'll have substantial effects, but there is a tradition of permitting regimes. But how do we think about, do you think, kind of a separate tradition that the Chief Justice and others have referred to in our constitutional law of concern about too much discretion in exercise of authority over constitutional rights and that too much discretion can lead to all sorts of problems, as our history shows? So you've got the tradition of permitting, but how -- how do we think about, fold in, just a general concern about too much discretion? "}, {"speaker": "Brian H. Fletcher", "text": " So I -- I appreciate that concern, and I think here's how I would think about it. First, I would say you -- there is a substantial history of discretion in this particular area, starting out with juries in the Texas and West Virginia type regimes that I talked about now moving into permitting officers.   And I think that's inherent in any system if you say a permit is going to be conditioned upon a showing that you have a genuine, specific need for self-defense, then someone's got to make the decision about whether or not you've made that showing.   New York has decided it's best to do that by delegating the authority to local officers, local judges, who are most familiar with local conditions. I do appreciate the concern about discretion, and I think, if the Court were to conclude that some sort of good cause sort of self-defense-based exception is -- is required, then the Court might conclude that some more predictable or stringent or prescriptive guidelines are required, that you can't have that much discretion if the Court concludes that that sort of good cause exception is actually constitutionally required. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you. Appreciate it. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Barrett? "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Clement? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Just a few quick points in rebuttal. First of all, I want to highlight that when the government was asked for its interest behind this permitting regime, it said that if it went to a different regime, it would multiply the number of firearms in circulation. In a country with the Second Amendment as a fundamental right, simply having more firearms cannot be a problem and can't be a government interest just to put a cap on the -- the number of firearms. And that just underscores how completely non-tailored this law is.   It might be well tailored to keeping the number of handguns down, but it's not well tailored to identifying people who pose a particular risk or anything else because it deprives a typical New Yorker of their right to carry for self-defense. The second point I want to make is just about population density.   There's been a lot of discussion about that, but it's very much a double-edged sword because, when there's population density, that's an awful lot of people who all have Second Amendment rights, and so you can't just simply say we're not going to have Second Amendment rights in the areas where there's dense population. And I would say, here, experience does tell you a lot.   By my count, seven of the 10 largest cities in America, measured by population, are in shall issue jurisdictions. And I've mentioned them, cities like Phoenix, Chicago, Houston.   These are large cities where it hasn't been a problem. If you want to look at the empirical evidence -- and I know, Justice Breyer, you asked about this -- please also look at the English brief on the top side because it's a very rigorous statistical analysis that shows that, as a matter of actually doing statistics right, there's no difference here, and what -- the only difference you really see is that people who have a handgun for self-defense end up with a better outcome.   They're not shot. They're -- they're not made victims.   But the English brief, I think, is really worth taking a look at. I want to say a quick word just about permitting.   There may be limiting permitting in other contexts, like parade permitting, but I'm not aware of any context whatsoever where, in order to get a permit, you have to show that you have a particularly good need to exercise your constitutional right.   And I think that is the absolute central defect with New York's regime here. I want to say a quick word about the history that my friend from the Solicitor General's Office emphasized.   It's telling that his first example is Tennessee.   If you look at the Heller decision, Tennessee is a problematic state in terms of its history.   The court gave -- that Tennessee Supreme Court first came out with the Aymette decision, which the majority opinion in Heller criticized.   It then came out with the Simpson decision and the Andrews decision, both of which protected Second Amendment rights, and the majority opinion in Heller praised those decisions at the same time that it criticized Aymette.   So, to the extent there was an 1821 statute, I would put it in the same box as the Aymette decision. Texas, which is their next example and their only other 19th Century example if I heard my friend correctly, is even more problematic to rely on because Texas had a specific constitutional amendment that was similar to the English Bill of Rights but differed from the Second Amendment, that allowed the legislature to put specific restrictions on the right.   So relying on 1871 Texas is highly problematic from a historical perspective. And that just leaves them with 20th Century examples, which we concede, but, by that point, the collective rights view of the Second Amendment was everywhere. Let me finish just by saying there's absolutely no need for a remand here.   There are interesting statistics that could be developed, but none of them are relevant to the two central defects in this regime. First, that in order to exercise a constitutional right that New York is willing to concede extends outside the home, you have to show that you have an atypical need to exercise the right that distinguishes you from the general community.   That describes a privilege. It does not describe a constitutional right. That is a sufficient basis to invalidate the law. But then there's the discretion, and the discretion here has real-world costs.   If you want to look at it, look at the amicus brief in our support by the Bronx Public Defenders and other public defenders.   The cost of this kind of discretion is that people are charged with violent crimes even though they have no private -- no prior record just because they are trying to exercise their constitutional right to self-defense. And if you want to know how this impacts policing, one of the ways essentially making everybody in New York City a presumptive person who is unlawfully carrying is that leads to stopping and frisking everybody. The framers, I think, had a different vision of the Fourth Amendment and the Second Amendment, and that is that individuals get to make their decision about whether or not they want to carry a firearm outside the home for self-defense. In 43 states, people are able to do that.   It has not -- it doesn't mean everybody ends up carrying, and it doesn't mean that those 43 states have any more problems with violent crimes or anything else than the six or seven jurisdictions that don't honor the text, the history of the Second Amendment, and Heller.
