[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 21-1043, Abitron Austria GmbH versus Hetronic International. Mr. Walker. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act does not apply to Petitioners' use of trademarks in foreign countries because nothing in the Act provides the clear, affirmative, and unmistakable indication needed to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality, especially as to foreign defendants, like Petitioners. The text of the statute never says it applies to uses of trademarks outside the United States.   And it is a foundational principle of both U.S. and international trademark law, embodied in multiple treaties, that trademark protections are inherently territorial and do not extend beyond the borders of the country granting protection. Any argument that the Act extends -- departs from that longstanding principle would have to be based on especially compelling evidence.   But, here, Hetronic International offers only the text definition of commerce, and this Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that commerce language is enough to extend the law to foreign conduct, even if that language otherwise invokes the full scope of a constitutional commerce power. International also invokes this Court's decision in Steele.   But Steele, by its terms, addressed only the Act's application to U.S. citizens acting abroad.   There is no reason to discard that self-imposed limit and extend Steele to reach foreign defendants like Petitioners. To the contrary, extending the Lanham Act's reach into foreign countries would create the very risk of international friction that this Court's current extraterritoriality doctrine seeks to avoid.   That leads to the suggestion that imposing liability for foreign sales to foreign buyers by foreign companies somehow qualifies as a domestic application of the Act. But, as International itself concedes, applying U.S. law to conduct abroad based on effects in the United States is an extraterritorial application of the law.   It is not a way of applying a nonextraterritorial law domestically.   Both the text and the focus of the Lanham Act require a domestic use of the mark in commerce.   Because Petitioners' foreign sales involve only uses outside the United States, they fall outside the Act's scope. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Could you imagine any set of circumstances where a sale that involves an international transaction could also involve conduct in the United States that violates the Lanham Act? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " So I think one example here would be the -- the 202,000 euros worth of direct sales to U.S. customers.   So those sales involved foreign buyers, the Petitioners, who were overseas at the time, but they were sold into the United States to foreign buyers.   And I think, in that situation, the mark is being used on those goods in commerce within the territory of the United States.   And so we have not disputed that that's permissible domestic application of the Lanham Act here. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I don't understand what that difference is from the sales to people in foreign countries who designated the United States as the mailing address.   You know that they're buying it to ship it into the U.S. Why aren't you aiding and abetting? And isn't that an effect as direct as the Lanham Act can ask for? You're interfering with commerce in the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " So two points on that. So the -- the -- the 3 percent of sales of the goods that may eventually reach the United States -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, no, no.   There was a bunch of goods in that second category -- "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Mm-hmm. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- that you sold to foreign buyers delivered -- for delivery to an address in the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " So the -- the delivery was actually in the foreign country.   They delivered to the buyers in the foreign country. The -- the delivery address on there actually meant that it had to be compatible with, say, FCC regulations so it could be used in the United States.   And so it was being sold to, for example -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You're begging the question. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " But -- so -- so even apart from that, I -- I -- I think what you would have there is the use of the mark in the United States is going to be when that is imported or maybe resold in the United States, when it reaches the territory of the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So, even if you know that it's going to the U.S., you're not responsible? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " I think, in that situation, it might be a question -- you -- you could definitely reach the person who brings it into the United States, but, if it's a foreign buyer, it would have to be on a theory of contributory liability, and there's been no -- there's been no argument here that we would be responsible in a contributory liability theory for people who later brought goods into the United States and may have violated the Lanham Act in the United States that way. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Doesn't your view overrule Steele? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " It -- it -- it doesn't. So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Explain how. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Yeah.   So Steele, by its terms, from its very first sentence and throughout its rationale, addressed how the Act applies to United States citizens who are acting abroad and -- and also acting within the United States.   It did not address how it applies to foreign defendants. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So explain to me how a U.S. citizen in a foreign country who does exactly what your client does, why should they be responsible but you not. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " So I think, under the Court's modern extraterritoriality doctrine, that's a very good question as to whether there should be a difference and that U.S. citizens acting abroad should get the same benefit of that presumption.   But Steele was decided well before that current doctrine, and so it thought that a U.S. citizen -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you're really -- you're just saying overrule it because it -- "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- it doesn't help you. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " No, I -- I -- I think the holding of Steele is that it applies to U.S. citizens because Congress has extraordinary power to regulate U.S. citizens abroad and does not raise issues of international law. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I see Steele as more consistent with the SG's view.   In Steele, the American citizen was in America, bought unnamed -- parts here, shipped them to Mexico. All of the assembly of the product was in Mexico.   Steele -- Steele, the -- the watch manufacturer, wasn't actually -- sold the marks -- sold the watches in Mexico but to stores that then sold it to American citizens.   So I don't know what the difference is. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Well, so we -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It wasn't as if the American citizen was himself handing the watch to buyers.   Retail stores were handing the watch to buyers, and they were coming across the border with those watches. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Yeah.   So Steele thought it was appropriate to apply the Lanham Act to a U.S. citizen where the mark was being used outside of the United States based on the -- some conduct in the United States, essential steps taken in the United States, and it affects -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you ignore the whole part of the decision that had to do with the confusion American consumers had by bringing the watches to be fixed in the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " It -- the -- the Court did acknowledge that one of the effects of the foreign conduct, the use of the mark in Mexico, was potential reputational or confusional harm within the United States.   And so it was sort of applying one of the conduct or effects tests that courts had been using for the Exchange Act, for example, and this Court rejected in Morrison. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Would Steele come out the same way today? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " I think probably not.   So U.S. citizens are also entitled to the presumption against extraterritoriality, and Steele's reasoning is really out of step with how this Court deals with extraterritoriality now. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So are you saying that the cleanest thing and the way to bring our cases in -- in line, to bring Steele and maybe this case before us in line with our modern extraterritoriality jurisprudence, is just to overrule it? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Well, it certainly -- that would be -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " I know -- I know you're saying we don't have to. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Yes.   So I -- I think the -- the cleanest way to decide this case, you could just say it addressed foreign defendants and not U.S. defendants.   The simplest, cleanest way to address the -- the harmony of the law as a whole may be to say that Steele has no further vitality to -- to overrule. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So would it be fair to characterize your position as saying Steele would come out a different way today? It's not necessarily -- not necessary to overrule that case, but the best way to make sense of Steele going forward would be to narrow it in the way that you're proposing? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " I -- I think that's right.   This Court declines to extend decisions that rest on principles that it has since rejected, and I think it's just important to respect the limits that Steele itself placed on its decision, which was we are addressing U.S. citizens because of that longstanding, deeply rooted principle that a country can govern its citizens anywhere in the world, which is something that simply does not apply to foreign defendants. And, here, you have the risk of foreign -- conflict with foreign laws and international friction that the European Union has gone out of its way to catalog that it thinks this is going the disrupt the international trademark system, which is premised on the strict territoriality of trademark protections. It's going to violate treaties that the United States and 178 countries have joined, like the Paris Convention and the Madrid Protocols, which has few -- fewer members but still many, and it's going to interfere with the administration of other countries' abilities to administer their own trademark laws within their own territories. And that's the conflict the -- that arises from trying to regulate transactions, you know, the use of marks in the marketplace, in commerce, in foreign countries.   That's the reason why Morrison declined to apply the Exchange Act extraterritorially even though courts had been doing that for decades, and it's the reason why it held that the focus of the Act should be a clean test when we're applying it domestically, where did the transaction that the Act is seeking to regulate occur. And, here, that transaction is the use of the mark in commerce.   And so it's that use of the mark in commerce that needs to occur within the United States for the Lanham Act to be properly applied domestically. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But why isn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, why -- why -- why can't it also be the effects of the use of the mark and where the effects took place, for example, where the confusion took place? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " So I think it would be unusual for the focus of a statute just to be the effects because, usually, when we're talking about effects from foreign commerce that are felt within the United States, we're talking about applying the law extraterritorially. That's how -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Steele, of course, does talk quite a bit about effects.   I mean, Steele is much more about effects than it is about the citizenship of the defendant. So we have Steele, and Steele is very much about how does this -- how is this felt in the United States.   But there's also aspects of our current law that are that.   I mean, when RJR talks about the injury, the injury is just a way of saying effects, and it says we're looking for domestic injury here. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Yeah.   Well, so, in RJR, I think that's a -- a -- a special situation because, there, the Court held that the substantive conduct regulating provisions were themselves extraterritorial at least in part. And so the conduct that was being regulated was permissibly extraterritorial. And so then it was saying at the second step, for the cause of action, a private cause of action, we need to apply the presumption again, and, there, we want to make really sure that we're not creating the risk of friction that can -- that exists when private liability is imposed for conduct occurring overseas, and so that's why we're going to insist on the domestic injury even if you have a domestic -- or you have an extraterritorial statute that's been violated.   And so -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And when -- when I look at the -- the cases that we've done on -- in -- in our modern regime, there's a good deal of flexibility actually in how we go about picking what the focus is. And you might say, well, that's a downside of our modern regime because it's a little bit amorphous and you don't quite know whether the focus is on the Act that you're regulating or instead the focus is on the people and the interests that you're protecting. But it's also the virtue of our modern law, which is we get to sort of look at a particular statutory regime and say, you know, what makes sense with respect to extraterritorial -- or with respect to domestic applications of extra -- of -- of -- of conduct occurring abroad. And -- and so there's a good deal of flexibility, and why shouldn't the flexibility be used in this context to say, look, this whole regime is about confusion.   The question is, is it causing domestic confusion? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " So I -- I -- I have three responses to that.   First, I think the regime is really about the use of the mark in commerce. The use of the mark in commerce is how you make -- you register a trademark, it's how you maintain a trademark, it's how you infringe a trademark.   The registered trademark protects the exclusive right to use the trademark in commerce. And I think the entire backbone of the statute focuses on that use, and I also think context is important.   And, here, we have the longstanding internationally recognized principle that trademark protections are territorial in nature and that foreign trademark protections don't apply within the United States.   United States trademark protections do not apply in foreign countries. And so the way you can administer that is -- is -- is through looking at a clear test, this is -- and this is my third point.   Morrison asks for a clear test to avoid the confusion and haziness that you might have when you're kind of balancing factors to figure out whether something applies to foreign conduct.   And I think that -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Can I ask you, do -- do you dispute that there's no trademark violation if the use of the mark in commerce doesn't cause customer confusion? I mean, you continue to say that what the statute cares about and what Congress is trying to regulate is the use of the mark in commerce.   But it was my understanding from the statutory scheme that even using a mark, you know, another -- a registered trademark in commerce is not going to be sufficient to trigger liability under the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " That's true.   So the right is defined, the mark-holder's right is defined as the exclusive right to use it in commerce.   An infringe -- an intrusion on that right by someone else using the mark is only actionable, it's only can give rise to liability if it's likely to cause confusion.   So that -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All right.   So then -- "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " -- that is -- that's a condition. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " I understand.   So then how can it be then that you say that the focus of this statute is only on the use of the mark? I mean, don't -- so, if there is domestic confusion about products that are being used in commerce in the United States, they're used in commerce because they're circulating in the United States, people are buying them, we're not just talking about a product that is, you know, in someone's basement or something, they're being used in commerce in the United States. I guess I don't understand why that wouldn't -- and, excuse me, confusing people -- why isn't that enough? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Well, I think, if the -- if the mark -- if the goods that are marked with the protected mark are being used in the United States, that would be a domestic use. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But I guess your test suggests that the maker, if they're overseas, would have to be the one to put it into commerce or it would have to be -- you know, in order for it -- for it to -- them to be liable, we'd have to have some idea that the maker themselves is using them in commerce in the United States directly shipping them in. And I'm not sure I understand why that's the case, because I'm sort of hypothesizing, you know, we -- we -- we're walking down the street in Manhattan and we see all of these, you know, fraudulent or fake -- fakely branded goods, and if they are made overseas and we can figure out who made them, wouldn't that be sufficient? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " I -- I -- I wouldn't think so.   So any -- obviously, anyone who is bringing it into the United States, importation is banned under Section 42 of the Act and under 43(b).   Anyone who is selling them in the United States, you can absolutely get them.   Anyone who's outside of the United States, you'd have to have a vicarious or contributory liability theory that hasn't been asserted here. But going after, you know, counterfeit is a serious problem, but going after people in foreign countries is something that is fraught with foreign affairs -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But why is that extraterritorial? That's all I'm asking.   If -- so fine.   Under the contributory liability theory, which you appear to think is something that can be done here although not alleged here, why is it extraterritorial to go after the manufacturer of fraudulent goods that are in commerce in the United States? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Well, it does raise some additional difficult questions as to when contributory or aiding and abetting qualifies as a domestic application.   So it -- it's happy that it's not raised here because the Court doesn't have to get into those questions, but in, you know, Nestle USA, you know, whether aiding and abetting depended on where the aiding and abetting happened or where the underlying tort happened was a difficult question the Court didn't decide. And so I -- I'm not saying the contributory liability would necessarily count as a domestic application, but that would have to be the theory of it for a person who is not themself using it in commerce. And two other points on the use.   So not every use of a mark has to be confusing for it to be subject to liability under the Lanham Act, Olympic emblems, for example.   This is 36 U.S.C. 220506(c) and was addressed in this Court's decision in San Francisco Arts and Athletics in 483 U.S. 522.   Just using them in commerce without any likelihood of confusion is enough to be liable. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But the core of the Act is certainly confusing uses, uses that confuse, and that's, you know, not a purposive question.   It's right there in the text of the statute repeatedly. So you're saying that, well, the focus of the statute is uses of the trademark.   That doesn't seem right.   The focus of the statute is uses of the trademark that confuse.   And if the uses of the trademark that, you know, confuse in the domestic market, that seems as though it should be enough under Morrison. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I think, in that situation -- I -- I -- I think the confusion is certainly a condition for it to be liable, but the use is itself defined as the relevant infringement.   That's in Section 33(b)(5) and (6) of the Lanham Act.   It talks about the use of a mark being charged as an infringement. And the other question -- you know, the other thing that Morrison was really concerned about was having a clear test that is not going to create a lot of confusion. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Morrison did not create a clear test.   I mean, if -- if you -- you know, our -- our most recent version of the test is the -- the statute's focus is the object of its solicitude, which can include the conduct that seeks to regulate as well as the parties in interests it seeks to protect or vindicate. So, in fact, Morrison created a quite flexible test, is that we're allowed to look at a statute and say what's really the purpose. Sometimes that will be conduct.   Sometimes it will be effects.   Sometimes it will be one person's conduct.   Sometimes, as Morrison shows, it will be an entirely different person's conduct. So, you know, there's a good deal of flexibility in this test, and the question is, why in this case, when we stare at the Lanham Act, isn't the focus of the statute confusing uses? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Well, I -- I think one other thing that Morrison thought was really important is that -- so the -- the focus itself may be a little unclear, but, for each statute, having a clear administrable test was really important, which is why it chose a transaction-based test. And if you're looking to where the likelihood of confusion exists, that's a pretty inadministrable test.   It's not even where did confusion exist; it's where, hypothetically, confusion could have existed.   That's not a question that's asked under the current likelihood-of-confusion test. And even likelihood of confusion is governed by a 13-factor test before the PTO. Here, the jury was instructed on seven nondispositive factors that it could give whatever weight it wanted to figure out whether there was a likelihood of confusion. And I think, if you have a test that requires juries or courts to balance seven or 13 factors to decide whether a likelihood of confusion exists in the United States, that's the sort of very-difficult-to-apply test that Morrison said should not be how we apply U.S. laws to foreign conduct. And the trade show example, I think, is a good example -- may I finish? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " If -- if trade shows held overseas can lead to domestic confusion when U.S. travelers come back to the United States and every country in the world followed that approach, you'd have U.S. law applies to a Berlin trade show when a U.S. customer walks by, Swiss law when a Swiss customer walks by, and a Chinese law when a Chinese customer walks by. And that's no way to administer an international trademark system premised on territoriality. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It seems to me that your position in this world of the internet makes very little sense.   Foreign buyers today do what almost all buyers do, which is advertise their goods on the internet, and they purposely target American customers in America.   The fact that they choose to deliver those goods at the border, outside the United States, or into the U.S., to me, should make no difference.   They are competing with the trademark owner in the U.S. to secure U.S. customers. And so I just can't see your territoriality rule making any sense because the case I gave is a version of Steele, frankly, and I don't see why overturning Steele or making it depend on the citizenship of the defendant is important.   I think the SG is right.   The issue is whether or not these acts are intended to cause confusion in the U.S., and that internet sale, to me, is clearly intended to violate the Act. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " So insofar -- once those goods come to the border, the importation, the sale in the United States absolutely falls within the Lanham Act, but if -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But not by you, the manufacturer.   You advertised it.   You delivered it to the border and said to the customer: Come with your truck, or pay a freight forwarder to bring it to you across the border. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's -- you're saying to me that's not actionable. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " -- barring some contributory liability, vicarious liability, I think that's right.   The fact is if -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Why does that make sense? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Well, if -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Given the purposes of the Lanham Act? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " So the -- the Lanham Act was enacted in 1946, and if it doesn't perfectly match with how the internet works today, that's understandable.   Congress has actually updated it in certain ways to address the internet. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, but -- but that's -- but what Congress did was say it's not just the use of a -- of a mark; it's the use of the mark with the intent to confuse or confusing people. This is a clear case of intending to confuse, the example I gave, of intending to confuse and actually doing it. "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Yeah.   Well, so I -- I do think, if it's ever going to reach someone who is only using the mark outside the United States, it would have to be because there is that domestic effect of confusion.   So we -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, that's part of -- "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- your brief.

So we have a German manufacturer of handbags who makes his own handbags but then also starts making knockoffs of Coach handbags, putting the mark on it just like Coach, and he has no intent of ever giving them -- or getting them to the United States, he sells only locally in Germany, and none of the bags ever get to the United States.   Would it be an extraterritorial application of this statute if Coach tried to sue them? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " If I'm understanding correctly, yes.   The use of the -- the mark is entirely outside of the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All right.   Same facts, except a group of American students, college students, spend a semester abroad in Germany, they buy the handbags, knockoffs of Coach, they come back to the United States, and people who see them with these bags are really confused because they look like Coach bags, and it starts actually diminishing Coach's brand because the bags are shoddy, and people are confused, and Coach is unhappy because people think they're their bags.   If Coach sues, is that an extraterritorial application or no? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " There, it would be.   The use of the mark is occurring outside of the United States.   Coach's remedy, as the Court explained in Microsoft versus AT&T, is to get German trademark protection, EU trademark protection, and enforce those rights there.

And I think one reason why that's the right answer is it would have U.S. liability, potential treble damages, something most of the world rejects, turn on how likely do we think it is that American students are going to be coming to this town in Germany and buying handbags and taking them -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " So you'd -- you'd have the same answer with the third version of this hypothetical, which is the American students are themselves very entrepreneurial and they take $100,000 and they buy a bunch of these bags, and then they bring them back to the United States and they put them into commerce in the United States.   They're on the street selling them.   They're creating their own websites selling them.   Coach figures out that these students aren't the ones that are really making the bags.   The bags are being made in Germany by this company.   Same result for you, no extraterritory -- that would be extraterritorial if Coach tries to sue the manufacturer? "}, {"speaker": "Lucas M. Walker", "text": " The manufacturer in Germany, yes.   The -- the -- the students who are selling and advertising the bags in the United States, they can go after them.   That's a domestic use of the mark in commerce. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Ms. Hansford. "}, {"speaker": "Masha G. Hansford", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals was mistaken in giving the Lanham Act sweeping extraterritorial reach.   At the first step of the two-step framework, the provisions here contain no clear affirmative indication of extraterritorial application.   And at step two, the focus of each provision is consumer confusion, which is the touchstone of trademark infringement. A use of a trademark that causes a likelihood of confusion in the United States is actionable just like a misrepresentation made abroad about a security listed on a U.S. stock exchange is actionable under Morrison.   That interpretation best makes sense of Steele, and it leads to a common-sense result.   A defendant is not liable for transactions that confuse only foreign customers, but a defendant who causes confusion in the United States, misappropriating U.S. goodwill, is liable. And although the difference between the government's position and Petitioners' is small, it is meaningful.   As Justice Sotomayor observed, Petitioners would exclude from the Lanham Act's coverage here $2 million worth of products they knew would be used in the United States, confusing U.S. consumers, simply because the purchasers, rather than Petitioners, arranged for the particular shipment of those goods into this country. I welcome the Court's questions.

We think the problem with Petitioners' approach of just limiting Steele to U.S. defendants is that that is not a rule that makes any sense.   There's no U.S. defendant requirement in the statute, whereas our reading of Steele makes sense of it in that it ties it to something in the statute, consumer confusion.

It thought this was a question of subject matter jurisdiction.   It's pellucid under this Court's precedents that's not correct.   And I don't think the Court would have any hesitation in saying, well, that -- that piece of the reasoning was incorrect.

The courts of appeals have taken themselves as free to form different tests based on Steele because of how amorphous it -- it is.   So I don't think anything needs to be overruled even though there are aspects of Steele that the Court would not bring forward. But, again, on the citizenship in particular, while we don't see a principled reason in the text that citizenship should be relevant and so it's hard to turn on that as a distinction of Steele, the Court does not need to opine that in this case because this is not a U.S. citizen case.

So you say it's not a jurisdictional issue and it doesn't matter whether it's a citizen or -- or a resident of the United States.   It sounds to me like you're asking us to overrule Steele in part.

Hansford", "text": " Justice Alito, if you read that as the holding in Steele, then I think that this is just a situation where Steele presents no impediment because it's not a U.S. citizen issue.   And then you would kind of take Steele out of consideration in deciding between us and Petitioners' position.   And we think that our position about what the focus of the statute is is the correct one for first principles.   The core of trademark is -- trademark infringement is consumer confusion, and if ever there were an object of solicitude, I think this is a really good example, in addition to being really parallel to the structure in Morrison.

A court in any member country, including Germany, that is competent to rule on trademark infringement would assess whether there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.\" And it goes on to say that the test for that for -- in these member countries concerns use that occurs in the union or in individual member countries.   Consumer confusion includes acts of targeting customers in the territory of the union, but it excludes the mere accessibility on a website of the territory covered by the trademark.

The European Union itself seems to define consumer confusion in a way that reaches acts abroad, putting up a website, taking down a website, as long as it has particular effects. And the German professors' brief also gives the example of negligent causation of a patent -- of patent infringement within the German territory, if you're causing it from abroad, but the infringement is within.   So I do think that -- I'm not saying that our law is on all fours with the laws of European countries, but this question of exactly what acts from outside that reach the goodwill within the country, I think that -- I think we're, on a big-picture level, using similar approaches.

Why do we deem it that way? His operations and their effects weren't confined within the territorial limits of a foreign nation.   He brought component parts of his wares in the U.S. and Bulovas filtered through the Mexican border into this country. His competing goods reflected adversely on Bulova's trade reputation in markets cultivated here as well as abroad.

Hellman", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Since 1952, this Court has held and repeatedly reaffirmed that the Lanham Act's uniquely broad language reaches infringement of U.S. marks that is carried out overseas. And during those 70 years, Congress has amended the Act 36 times, and it has never pulled back on the Act's extraterritorial reach. This Court should maintain the status quo.   It should maintain it as a matter of precedent.   The Lanham Act has been this Court's go-to example of a statute whose \"sweeping language reaches to the limits of Congress's powers\" and differentiates it from other \"boilerplate statutes.\" What this Court said in Steele, in Aramco, and in Morrison should not be cast aside. The Court should also maintain the status quo because Petitioners' policy arguments fail on their own terms.   As of 2018, there were 72 cases considering the Act extraterritorially as to foreign defendants.   For all of Petitioners' predictions of conflict, not one of them granted relief under the Act where the defendant possessed superior foreign rights. Instead, what the Act has done is to protect U.S. mark-holders with a much-needed remedy in cases just like this one against foreign trademark pirates who market knockoff goods that siphon the goodwill and sales of U.S. trademark holders. Seventy years of experience shows that the floodgates haven't opened and that the Lanham Act has instead served as a bulwark against infringement that has an obvious and substantial and, in this case, a decidedly intended effect on U.S. commerce just as Congress provided. Petitioners' demand that the Act should now be weakened should be addressed to Congress, not this Court. But even if the Court were to conclude that the Act applies only domestically, it should still affirm because Petitioners' infringement implicated both concerns of the Act here: harm to mark-holders and harm to consumers. Hetronic suffered from infringement right here in the United States, and Petitioners obtained their ill-gotten gains from a web of infringing uses, all of which were likely to confuse American consumers. And with that, I'd be happy to answer the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " What are the limits of your argument?

There are going to be multiple barriers to relief, which is one reason why I think you see a relatively few number of cases. First of all, in the real world, if you'll allow me, personal jurisdiction is going to be an absolute bar to many, many cases.   But then, just with respect to the Lanham Act itself, there are multiple considerations, multiple bars.   The effect needs to be substantial.   Insubstantial effects don't count. Secondly, the nature of the Lanham Act likelihood-of-confusion test distinguishes between uses, between marks that don't look the same that aren't for the same products, where the petitioner -- where the plaintiff's mark isn't well-known in the area, where the defendant acts in bad faith. If I -- if I just may, what those factors work out to in practice is, you know, one vision of this is somebody's out there in a foreign country using the same mark that happens to be the same as a U.S. mark.   But there's no competition between those goods.   There's no confusion between those goods.   Those claims are going to fail at the liability stage. But where there's an -- often an intentional attempt to siphon that goodwill from a well-known mark, as we had in this case, that is where the courts have generally found there to be liability under the Lanham Act extraterritorially. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I think I'm -- I think I'm a bit more interested in your effects test.   You said substantial effects.

But even if you think that that is a modest limit on the -- here, you still have the nature of the Lanham Act inquiry itself, along with proximate cause and everything else my friends have been talking about this morning. But, again, the likelihood-of- confusion test distinguishes by its very nature those kinds of uses of the mark that are incidental, that aren't particularly close, versus the ones that are intended to get something very valuable from that plaintiff mark-holder. And, again, we're not writing on a blank slate here.   The question of whether or not the Act overcomes the presumption was expressly addressed by the Court in Steele.   It was the subject of the dissent, which said the Lanham Act isn't explicit enough to overcome the presumption.   That was the dissent's position in that case.   And the majority found the other way. And that's not a revisionist reading of the -- of Steele.   It's exactly what this case said in Aramco.   In Aramco, the government took the position that Title VII must apply extraterritorially just like the Lanham Act does.   And the Court said, no, that's not right, and not because it found the Lanham Act wanting. What it emphasized instead was that the sweeping language unique in the Civil Code, there is no other commerce power defined in the same way that the Lanham Act does, unique in the Civil Code made the Lanham Act different from other kinds of boilerplate statutes. Justice Kagan referred to perhaps we were underselling Steele.   I -- I agree that what we heard this morning does undersell it, but I think you can go even a little bit further with what Steele says. Steele, as Justice Kagan quoted, talked about the infringement harming Bulova's reputation not just in the United States but in markets abroad.   And there's been a lot of discussion this morning about, can you limit Steele just to U.S. defendants? I don't think that's giving the case a coherent reading.   I do -- I do not believe the Court said in Steele -- it would be quite surprising if it did say -- that U.S. statutes apply extraterritorially so long as there's a U.S. defendant.   That's not something the Court's ever said, and I don't think that makes the best sense of what Steele said. What Steele, again, pointed to the sweeping language of the commerce clause or the commerce provision of the statute as giving rise to the overcoming the presumption. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

This Court has said for 70 years that the Act applies extraterritorially.   We -- we could -- we could disagree about whether or not that was the right ruling in Steele, but it is inarguable that that's what the -- how the Court's decision has been understood by this Court and by lower courts. If there is a -- if a different balance of trademark law is called for, that is a question for Congress, which is, again, has tended to the Lanham Act with great care, 36 amendments, including ones in response to decisions from this Court in the Trademark Modernization Act of just a few years ago.

The territorial approach to trademark law -- and the Paris Convention predates Steele, so this territorial approach that everyone is talking about simply means that each nation is the ultimate arbiter of its own trademark laws. The Germans decide what a German mark is, and the U.S. decides what a U.S. mark is. But that doesn't mean -- in fact, it means the opposite -- U.S. -- the U.S. is allowed to decide that where foreign conduct has a substantial effect on U.S. commerce and -- and harms goodwill, et cetera, that is actionable under the Lanham Act.   And that's how it's been for 70 years. There's a little bit of a -- with respect to my friends on the other side -- a touch of -- an air of unreality to the discussion this morning.   We're not trying to predict how the Act would work extraterritorially.   It has been working extraterritorially for 70 years. And, again, I -- I hear my friends on the other side saying maybe that wasn't the right decision.   We certainly think it was, but no one can dispute that has been the law.

Substantial effects is baked into the test of what Congress -- when you ask how far can Congress go, substantial effects is a -- is a constitutional limitation on that, as I understand it, from this Court's cases.   So you need to have substantial effects. Then the Lanham Act just talks about the regulation of commerce to that extent.   But there -- there remain background principles, including the text of the statute talking about the remedial principles for what it would mean for when you can get certain remedies and when you're entitled to relief.   This is a liability question in the -- in the first instance. So there's no inconsistency there. And, again, this is how the Act has worked for -- I -- I -- I -- I hesitate to repeat myself, but it's important.   It's pretty rare for this Court to have 70 years of experience with a statute, Congress's acquiescence in that, and then to say -- I think my friends on the other side are suggesting that you give Steele a much narrower reading than what it actually said.

It -- it -- it -- it absolutely is. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But, of course, that wasn't really the facts in Steele, right? So we don't get that from Steele.

Hellman", "text": " That was part of Steele, Your Honor, but there's more to Steele. Steele also explains in that core passage that Justice Kagan referred to as the heart of the decision, this -- the claim is good because his competing goods could well reflect adversely on Bulova Watches' trade reputation in markets cultivated by advertising here as well as abroad. The Court understood, as I think it faithfully would, consistent with the nature of the commerce provision in the case, if -- if Hetronic, my client, isn't able to sell to those German customers, notwithstanding the fact that it has spent a lot of time and effort to become well-known to them due to infringing conduct, that's exactly what Steele was talking about, and that's exactly how Steele has been interpreted in the intervening 70 years. The -- I would also point -- you know, there's been a lot -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why didn't -- why didn't you sue in Germany? You had a strong declaration from the -- you had a declaration from the European Union that the Petitioners didn't have rights to the marks they were using. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " That's correct.   The -- the -- the defendants here don't have the rights in Europe as well.   We have brought suit in the European courts.   A couple points on that. To the extent this Court is thinking that it's always going to be available to -- to bring any sort of action in a foreign court, that's not going to be the case with many countries that don't have intellectual property rights, that are not signatories to the treaties that my friends have been talking about. And it's also the case that the Lanham Act -- Congress made the decision in the Lanham Act to provide an additional remedy.   We have sued in the German courts.   We are able to get some relief there.   But we're also able to get other relief under the U.S. laws. And, again, if that balance is out of whack, I really, I submit it's not this Court's job, having found the Act applies extraterritorially, to try to adjust it itself. And I -- you hear the troubles that the other side have had -- had articulating what should you do with Steele in light of what it said.   I've heard it should be limited to U.S. defendants only. That's not giving Steele credit for what Steele said.   It's also not -- it doesn't lead to a coherent opinion. You -- the -- Congress may have the ability to regulate Americans doing things overseas, but the question is does the Lanham Act overcome the presumption that Congress usually doesn't require -- doesn't -- doesn't allow that. Here it did, not on the basis of the citizenship test alone but on the basis of that uniquely broad commerce provision.   And, again, the very fact that Steele is citing foreign defendant cases tells you that it's not a -- it's not -- it wasn't just limiting itself to U.S. defendants. And that's exactly what the Court said in Aramco and again in Morrison.   We've talked about the modern framework.   The very case that inaugurates the modern framework holds onto Steele as saying that is an example of a statute that applies extraterritorially and not in a passing observation.   It made the -- it made the point affirmatively to rebut an argument by the government that the Lanham Act wasn't, in fact, an extraterritorial statute. So, again, Zelig-like, the Lanham Act appears in your Court's cases to say where this Court is pointing to is it being different and special, and I submit, with 70 years of experience behind -- behind us with it, the right course is to allow Congress to change it if Congress see -- so sees fit. The other point I'd make about the international nature of -- of this -- of this question is there's one entity that submitted an amicus brief that represents both U.S. and international interests in this case.   That is the INTA brief, the International Trademark Association's brief.   They, along with the other trademark associations in this case, all say that the Act should apply extraterritorially. All of them hold -- hold to that. So, again, with 70 years behind us, the proper course for -- for this Court is to -- to continue to allow the Act to apply extraterritorially. If I may, I'd like to talk a little bit about the domestic focus aspect of the case as well.   We certainly agree with the United States that uses that pose a likelihood of confusion to American consumers fall within the Act that -- under that kind of domestic focus theory.   But that's really only half the story in terms of what the Act is concerned with. The Act is also concerned with harm to mark-holders.   That's right there in the intent, the enacted intent statement or purpose of the Act.   It's also what this Court has said time and again when talking about the purposes of the Lanham Act, its double focus, double -- doubly concerned, both harm to the mark-holders and confusion. Justice Gorsuch, I heard your suggestion that perhaps you look to when the Act or when a claim accrues as understanding when the focus might come into -- come into focus. Well, that likelihood of consumer confusion is simultaneous with the harm to -- to -- to goodwill.   Those two things are two sides of the same coin.   And so we suggest that if the Court is going to look to a domestic -- treat the Act domestically, it should not limit itself to just one focus but both focuses that are mentioned right there in the stated purpose of the Act and capture what the Act is concerned with. Loss to goodwill, harm to goodwill is just as important under the Act as consumer confusion.   In fact, it's so important that consumers aren't allowed to bring lawsuits under the Act for their confusion.   The only entity that's allowed to sue under the Lanham Act is the mark-holder.   It's a mark holder-only -- that's what the Court said in Lexmark.   Only the mark-holder has standing to bring suit. And if the Court understands the Lanham Act in that domestic way, it should affirm because the -- the evidence here showed that there was harm to the mark-holder right here in the United States with Hetronic losing diverted sales and reputational harm. Again, you know, the -- we had a whole trial in this case along with injunctive findings by the -- by the trial court.   The record in this case shows that Hetronic was plagued with complaints about devices that its customers thought were Hetronic's when, in fact, they were the infringing devices.   That kind of harm to reputation evinces both consumer confusion and -- and harm to the mark-holder. Both of them are uses of the -- are -- are -- are foci of the Act and both of them should be considered to the extent that the Court has -- treats the Act as in terms of the domestic application.

Hellman", "text": " Yes, because they -- they -- they -- they were our customers.   And that gets to another textual point that I think is important that may have gotten not the time it deserves this morning so far. The Lanham Act reaches infringing uses of a mark.   A use is not just a sale.   A use is, to quote the statute, \"the offering for sale, the distribution or advertising of the good.\" So the Lanham Act -- if -- if the Court believes that uses that are likely to confuse Americans fall within the Act, then it should -- then it should follow the Act's text and recognize that advertising, offering for sale, those are the kinds of uses Congress was concerned with just as much as the sale. And so, when you have something like a -- a trade show in this case where literally there are -- there's our booth and the -- the other side's booth and they're saying that they're us and they're offering their product for sale, it's that use that is the -- the evil that the Lanham Act looks to in the first instance, and then, if there's consumer confusion and loss of goodwill from that use because it's infringing, that's when you have a violation that accrues.

Most of them aren't, you know, marketed side by side with the real thing with someone claiming that they're the -- the actual -- the actual mark-holder.   That's what this case is, and that's why that use was likely to confuse Americans.

What if there were no Americans at this trade show? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew S. Hellman", "text": " If -- if -- if there's no -- under the government's view, under -- under the test the government is offering, the question is likelihood of American confusion.

There's initial interest confusion, there's confusion attendant with the sale, and there's post-sale confusion where the -- the good is, you know, circulating around.   Those are -- any of those uses that -- that lead to, in a -- in a causal way, those kinds of confusions are actionable under the Act. So we're -- we're just -- in -- in this part of the case, we're -- we're just simply saying apply trademark law as it's -- in fact, in every part of this case, we're saying apply trademark law as it has been applied, but particularly in this instance, yes, if someone is out there targeting Americans or -- such that there's a substantial effect on U.S. commerce due to that confusion with Americans, that is actionable. Otherwise, if -- if you don't -- if you don't hold that, you are really giving a license for all sorts of manipulation of -- of the -- of the kind that I think Petitioners were talking about, someone doesn't sell directly to Americans but knows that Americans will see it. The Lanham Act should be available, has been available.   If anybody's going to say that the Lanham Act doesn't reach that kind of thing, it should be Congress, not this Court, given the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the history of the Act in this Court to date.

The -- the only complaint that Hetronic International actually received from a customer was a European customer, and they actually, as soon as they saw the genuine Hetronic part, they said, oh, that's not the product that I have. They told them apart on site.   That's JA 34. The goods that eventually reached the United States, this was not handing someone to a messenger to carry across the border.   They were selling to foreign manufacturers of cranes and other heavy equipment.   We sold the remote controls.   They incorporate them with the cranes.   The cranes were sold into the United States or were used by the foreign buyer. It's not even clear that the controls would be seen by any consumer in the United States.   JA 5 and 6 talk about that. The -- the letters that purportedly said that we are the real Hetronic, they said: We parted ways with the other Hetronic locations.   We are Abitron now.   We're the same company.   Hetronic Germany began operating as Abitron Germany.   But they said we are not Hetronic.   Those are other guys.   That's JA 15. Now there was some dissatisfaction with the focus test, and so I think there is another way to say that the Court -- that the statute requires a domestic use in commerce, and that's just looking at the text itself. So Sections 32 and 43, the causes of action, they require the use of the mark in commerce.   And now, as the government correctly recognizes, the commerce definition does not overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.   So that means it's talking about domestic commerce.   It requires a domestic use of the mark in commerce within the United States. And that ends up reading the \"use in commerce\" consistently throughout the entire statute because the use in commerce of a mark is also required under Section 1 to register a mark.   It's also required under Section 8 to maintain a mark.   The PTO has -- for the entire existence of the Act, correctly recognizes that that's a domestic use in commerce. It wouldn't make any sense to allow a U.S. trademark right to be based on uses of the mark outside of the United States.   And that's why the statute itself says in Section 2(d) that when the PTO is examining trademark registration applications, it has to consider resemblance to other marks previously used in the United States.   If it was going to be affording protection outside of the United States, you'd want the PTO to be examining against uses outside of the United States. A couple other textual points to make very quickly.   The amendments, I think my friend said there were about 38 amendments to the Lanham Act.   There are no relevant amendments except for two.   Section 7 was amended to say that filing the application gives a right that is -- a right of priority that is nationwide in effect.   It wouldn't make any sense for that to be a nationwide right of priority if it was purporting to give rights that apply outside of this nation. Congress also amended the Act to implement the Madrid Protocol, and that is all about territorial extension of trademark protections that exist in one country into the territory of another country.   And the way it does that is not by projecting the first country's laws into the second country's territory by its own force but by obtaining rights under the domestic law of the second country.   That's the way the territorial trademark regime that the United States and 178 other countries have signed on to works. Going to the -- the -- the other proposed foci of the -- the Act, International's test ends up applying the Act the same if it's extraterritorial and the same if it's domestic, which I think is a good sign that that's not really a domestic application of the Act.   When we're talking about foreign conduct with an effect in the United States, that's historically been an extraterritorial application of the Act. But International will go a step further and essentially allow any U.S. citizen plaintiff to bring a suit because it feels any harm suffered abroad at its home.   And that not only gives it an overwhelming protectionist scope; it also violates the nondiscrimination principle of the Paris Convention, which requires the same remedies be given to both U.S. citizens with U.S. trademarks and foreign citizens with U.S. trademarks. Going to the government's test, I originally thought from their briefing that they said use the likelihood-of-confusion test that we already use to determine liability, that 13-factor or seven-factor test.   But now they say it actually needs to be actual confusion, not just a likelihood of confusion.   I'm not sure how they reconcile that with the text of the statute, but that's yet another test departing from current law.   It's not just an off-the-shelf test. And it also says, well, if there's any problems, we can go to comity.   But comity has never been a substitute for rigorously enforcing this Court's extraterritoriality doctrine, and it adds another seven judge-made nondispositive factors to figure out whether U.S. law ends up governing conduct and transactions that occur in the territories of foreign countries. The focus test might be flexible, but it favors an administrable test. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
