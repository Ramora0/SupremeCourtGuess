[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 19-930, CIC Services versus the IRS. Mr. Norris. "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: CIC Services wants to challenge an IRS notice under the APA.   That guidance document subjects an entire industry to a burdensome reporting regime, but it never went through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Congress did not exempt the IRS from the APA.   And this Court has refused to carve out exceptions to APA review good for tax law only.   While the Anti-Injunction Act bars many tax cases, it does not bar this ordinary administrative law case. CIC's suit does not have the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of taxes for three main reasons. First, CIC is challenging the notice, not the assessment or collection of any tax. Under Direct Marketing, the reporting requirements that the notice triggers do not implicate assessment or collection.   While these requirements are enforced in part by tax penalties, CIC does not challenge the penalties, the IRS has not assessed any penalties, and CIC is a law-abiding company that will never incur any penalties. At most, an order setting aside the notice would prevent the IRS from collecting future tax penalties if someone someday decided to violate the reporting requirements.   But that kind of downstream attenuated effect on taxes does not count under Direct Marketing. Second, CIC's injuries have nothing to do with tax liability.   Its injuries are the costs of complying with the notice's reporting requirements and the loss of business that comes with being labeled a reportable transaction. Third, CIC cannot raise its claims in a refund suit.   There is no tax for CIC to pay here.   The notice is not a tax, and CIC is a material advisor, not the taxpayer. To file a refund suit, CIC would have to gin up a tax by violating the reporting requirements, risking criminal and professional sanctions, and hoping the IRS agrees to assess it a penalty.   The Anti-Injunction Act cannot require this, as this Court held in South Carolina versus Regan. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, I -- I think I heard you say that you're asking that the notice be set aside.   But maybe it's a technical matter, but that's not actually what you're asking.

I think it is a technical matter.   I think the way that a court would enjoin enforcement in an APA case is under 5 U.S.C. 706, which says you set aside the unlawful agency action. But even if you didn't need to enjoin the IRS from enforcing the notice as a technical matter, that still would not be the purpose of this lawsuit.   The purpose, as this Court explained in Bray, means what the lawsuit is aimed at, not merely the incidental effect of it.   And, here, our suit is aimed at the notice. That is the thing that's being challenged and the thing we want the enforcement to be enjoined for. We did not ask for an injunction related to tax penalties.

Specifically what are its injuries? And are those injuries tax liability or not? And, third, does the plaintiff have the traditional refund suit option available?

Your complaint asks to declare the notice invalid and, hence, a declaration that penalties can't be assessed against you.

Norris", "text": " We disagree, Your Honor. I think another factor in Bob Jones and Americans United that's missing here is that the Court said those plaintiffs, because their injury is tax liability, they could simply pay the underlying income, unemployment, and Social Security taxes and then sue for a refund.

Regan plays in your argument. As I understood it coming into this argument, what you were saying is that even if I'm with the government sort of every step of the way as to what the AIA requires, that there's still a kind of back-end equitable exception that's created by that case. Is -- is that what you're saying, or are you saying something different? "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " That's our argument, Justice Kagan.   I meant to say just that, when you're assessing a suit's purpose, the fact that a tax is not available to pay for a refund suit is also relevant.   But your -- you described Regan correctly.   It is an exception to the act. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   So I -- I guess what I'd like to know is where does that exception come from, and -- and -- and what justification would we have to extend that exception to a case like yours? "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " So I think our case is maybe the easiest justification for the exception.   So I read Regan to be an application of the whole code canon, that Congress does not require you to violate one provision of the tax code in order to sue for a refund.   That's contradictory and something -- not a way that you would reasonably read the tax code to operate. And so, in a normal Anti-Injunction Act case, the Anti-Injunction Act tells you to comply with the tax code, to pay your taxes, and then go sue for a refund.   But in a case like -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You're not suggesting that that -- that that is the rationale that's used in South Carolina v. Regan, are you? To me, the rationale that is used in that case is really equitable in nature.   It doesn't refer to the statute.   It doesn't ask about how we should interpret the statute.   It just says this seems fair to us. "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " Regan may not be the most tax-based opinion, but the same could be said of -- of Bob Jones.   Sometimes I -- I think the rigor that was present in Direct Marketing is missing from these cases, but I think Regan was correct that Congress never meant the Anti-Injunction Act to apply without a refund suit because those two provisions have always been side by side.   And that was the logic of that decision.   And we think that extends neatly to the situation where the government would require us to violate the tax code in order to trigger a refund. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and -- and I guess this goes back to Justice Breyer's question, but it seems to me that your suit is different from Regan in two ways.   One is that there was a constitutional claim there, and the second was that the Court kept on saying in Regan there's absolutely no alternative remedy available.   It's not just a -- a favored alternative.   I mean, there's no alternative remedy -- remedy. Do you take issue with either of those two differences? "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " I don't disagree that those are differences, Justice Kagan.   I just don't think that they matter.   This Court has said over and over that the constitutional versus non-constitutional nature of the claim is irrelevant for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.   And I think, while South Carolina truly had no refund suit available, we are in the same situation in the sense that the only way we can get a refund is by committing a crime, risking imprisonment and massive fines, and violating our professional obligations as attorneys and accountants.

I'd like to get your response or thoughts on Judge Sutton's concurrence in the denial of rehearing en banc, and he expressed one concern that, given the fact that the Anti-Injunction Act and Tax Injunction Act are so often interpreted in parallel, that by vindicating a taxpayer -- federal taxpayer's interests today, we might slight state sovereign concerns tomorrow, creating the risk that too much haste in stopping one abuse of power might open the door to another. I'd like your thoughts in response to that. "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " Yes, Justice Gorsuch. The Anti-Injunction Act and the Tax Injunction Act have been linked for a long time, and I don't think that link is something that can be undone.   The Tax Injunction Act was modeled on the Anti-Injunction Act.   They use the same terms in the same way.   This Court has frequently linked them. But, if the concern is that by saying the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply here, that that will make it less applicable to state taxes, I think in terms of the facts of our case that ship has largely sailed.   Direct Marketing allows pre-enforcement challenges to state tax reporting requirements, and it allowed them despite an uncontested assertion from Colorado that that lawsuit would have cost it 100 million dollars in tax revenue every year. And I -- and I think what this Court has to do is look at the precise language of each statute and apply it only as far as the language goes.   And neither statute, as this Court said in Direct Marketing, was meant to cover the entire waterfront of all cases involving taxes.   They were specifically targeted to suits to enjoin assessment or collection.

And it's -- it's worse than that because most of what the IRS does via regulation and guidance documents is enforced in some way by tax penalties.   So if -- if -- if the government is correct here, then the IRS is going to be largely exempt from APA review because of the Anti-Injunction Act. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Thank you.

I wanted to give you my thought about how I'm looking at this and get your reaction. So, on the tax, I see this as a Subchapter 68 penalty that, therefore, qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. On Direct Marketing, it seems to me that that's arguably distinct because the penalty there was not a tax.   Here, it is so defined as a tax and, therefore, comes within the scope of the Anti-Injunction Act. Then we get to the question -- and there's -- and there's other questions -- but the regulatory tax question, the Bob Jones and Alexander cases, and I want to get your reaction to this, which is I think reading those cases as they are poses a problem for you, but I'm not sure those cases are -- should be read for all they're worth. In other words, I'm wondering whether those cases -- we should back away from some of the implications of those cases for challenges to regulatory taxes for the reasons, some of the reasons you've given here, that it seems somewhat unfair, as it did even in those cases, somewhat unfair to force someone to go through the process that you're talking about here. So should we back away from Bob Jones and Alexander? How would we do that best without flat-out overruling them, or -- or should we go that far? "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " So, Justice Kavanaugh, I think the way to cut through all of that is our South Carolina versus Regan argument, and I would just note that in the Florida Bankers case in the D.C. Circuit, Regan was not an argument raised by the plaintiffs, and, in fact, the government pointed out that it had been waived there. And I think that's the key difference. Bob Jones and Americans United said that those plaintiffs, because they were challenging their tax liability, really could simply pay the underlying taxes, which is a lawful act, and go sue for a refund.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But isn't -- isn't that, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, just a pleading exercise of how you frame it in your complaint? I'm challenging actually the regulatory part of the regulatory tax, as opposed to the enforcement of the liability itself? "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " I don't think so, Justice Kavanaugh.   I agree that a case involving a regulatory tax truly would be difficult.   So perhaps NFIB can be understood as such a case because, there, the statute -- the individual mandate was upheld because it was treated as a tax itself. But, here, we don't have a regulatory tax.   We have a reporting requirement that exists in an independent statutory provision that uses the word \"shall\" and has the force of law. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, it's a reg -- a regulation that's enforced by a penalty, so it is regulatory, a reporting requirement enforced by a penalty that in turn Congress has defined as a tax.   So it does seem like a regulatory tax in that sense. "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " I don't disagree with that, Justice Kavanaugh, but it is also enforced by criminal sanctions.   So that's how you know it is not just a tax.   Or it's not really a tax at all.   It is an independent regulatory requirement. I think that makes all the difference because, when you're asking what the purpose of a suit is, you want to know what it's aimed at, and if it's aimed at a regulatory tax, that's a much different case than aimed at a regulation that is not itself a tax and that merely has tax penalties as one consequence for violating it.

He asked you to state a test, essentially, to help us decide, you know, when something falls within the AIA and not.   And, you know, the government's approach in thinking about why this is different from Direct Marketing is pretty straightforward. If it's called a tax, you know, Congress put this -- it called it a tax -- even though it's a penalty, it called it a tax, which seems to indicate Congress's desire to bring it within the AIA. But you're saying it's more -- it's more subtle than that, it's more complicated, you know, this is -- we can't -- we don't have a choice of just paying it and then seeking a refund later. So could you be a little bit more specific than you were with Justice Alito of what test do we use to figure out if it's within the AIA or not? "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " Yes, Justice Barrett.   I think the IRS's position is simple in that if any regulation is attached -- has a tax penalty attached, it triggers the Anti-Injunction Act, but that largely, as I said before, exempts the IRS from APA review. So the -- the -- the text of the Anti-Injunction Act asks whether your purpose is restraining assessment or collection.   And we know what \"restrain,\" \"assess,\" and \"collect\" mean from Direct Marketing already.   So we think the way to establish the purpose of a lawsuit, which we admit is fairly unusual language for a statute, but the way to do purpose comes from this Court's cases, and what you would look at is what action is the plaintiff challenging and whether that's assessment or collection or not, what are the plaintiff's injuries and are they independent from tax liability or not, and what else -- how else could the plaintiff bring the lawsuit, did they have a traditional refund suit available or not? And we -- we get those from -- from Bob Jones, Direct Marketing, and Regan.   And I think those three questions will answer just about every Anti-Injunction Act case.   And, here, they all point in the same direction and demonstrate that that is not our purpose.

Notice 16-66 labels my client's industry a reportable transaction, a kind of scarlet letter that triggers burdensome reporting requirements and makes it much harder to attract clients. Labeling something a reportable transaction is serious, which is why Congress told the IRS to use notice-and-comment rulemaking.   When the IRS refused to do that, CIC did precisely what we want law-abiding citizens to do: It filed a pre-enforcement suit under the APA, and it is fully complying with the reporting requirements while its case is pending. According to the government, however, what CIC should have done is deliberately violate the tax code.   The government's path would require CIC's members to commit a crime, violate their ethical obligations, and convince the IRS to assess it tax penalties.   No law-abiding company or individual would ever do this. Ruling for the government, thus, does not delay judicial review, it denies it altogether.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bond. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan C. Bond", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the heart of this case are two code provisions that are unambiguous and a third whose scope is disputed.   The first clear provision is the Anti-Injunction Act, which bars a suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. That text and this Court's decisions make clear that a suit cannot proceed if the relief it seeks would legally bar the IRS from collecting a tax, regardless of the plaintiff's objective or motive for bringing suit, as I understand Petitioner now to acknowledge. The second unambiguous provision is 6671, which provides that penalties imposed in subchapter 68(b) are treated as taxes.   And by far, the most important consequence of that provision is that 68(b) penalties are subject to the AIA, which precludes pre-enforcement review and instead channels disputes to refund suits. Together, those two provisions resolve this case because Petitioner's complaint on its face at page 16 seeks to enjoin the enforcement of reporting requirements that are enforced by 68(b) penalties. Petitioner leans heavily on a third provision, Section 7203, which makes certain willful violations a misdemeanor and which it says requires committing a crime to obtain judicial review.   But Petitioner misreads that provision, which does not criminalize the very avenue of review this Court commended 93 years ago in Sullivan and has reaffirmed since, of filing a timely return that asserts a good faith objection to reporting certain information in order to obtain review. Petitioner can do that by incurring the penalty, paying it, and suing for a refund. But even if 7203's application were ambiguous, the way to harmonize all three provisions is to hold that Congress meant what it said unambiguously in 6671 and the AIA, that these penalties are treated as taxes that must be litigated in refund suits, and resolve any lingering dispute about \"willfully\" to preserve Congress's choice. Petitioner's approach of leveraging one disputed word in another provision to override the clear text of 6671 and the AIA has things backwards.   And Petitioner has offered no limiting principle to avoid subjecting many other similar requirements enforced by taxes to pre-enforcement suits. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

So I'm curious about how much weight you think that can -- can hold.

If that relief would legally bar the collection of a tax, then, yes, Congress made the determination to channel that dispute to refund suits.   It's not eliminating review. It's simply channeling it to a different forum. And we know that that review is real because that's been the case throughout the AIA's history, going back to Bailey versus George, that the same day that the Court held the pre-enforcement suit barred, the Court reached the merits in a refund suit.

And so we look, as the Court has done before, to the relief requested as the best evidence of what the suit's purpose is. So at least in a case like this one where the suit on its face seeks to enjoin enforcement, which is done by assessing taxes, you would say the suit is one to restrain those taxes. I think you get into difficult line-drawing problems when you get further and further removed.   So, for example, the example that we discuss in our brief of the EPA diesel regulations, I think you could have too attenuated a chain of connection in order to impute the purpose of the suit to be restraining the -- the downstream tax where, for example, the plaintiff challenges only an independent regulatory regime enforced completely separately by an additional agency that also is incorporated in part into the tax code in some indirect way. The first suit may have some downstream consequence, but we accept that that may be too attenuated to say that the purpose of the suit is to restrain the assessment or collection of a tax. But you don't have any of those difficult line-drawing questions here. Petitioner says you should determine what the suit is aimed at, but the complaint on its face tells you what it's aimed at. If Petitioner prevails, the IRS will be unable to enforce this -- this notice requirement and -- or this reporting requirement, and it does so by assessing taxes.

Instead, what you do -- and the Court has upheld this in the context of Fifth Amendment objections -- is you file a return and state your specific objection to particular information that you don't want to provide because you believe in good faith that it is not legally required.

Today, of course, the IRS regulates enormous swaths of the national economy, from our medical care to our pensions, to the entire nonprofit sector, a lot of the educational sector, child care.

I'm going to tell you where I'm -- I think I'm with you and where I think I have a problem. On the text of the Anti-Injunction Act, I think you have a strong argument, Subchapter 68 and how that fits here.   This penalty is designated a tax; therefore, it fits within the AIA. Direct Marketing, I think you have a good point.   That was not subject -- that penalty was not denominated a tax and, therefore, the reason the two cases would be different is that the text of the statutes is different.   You make a good point there, I think. In terms of the Regan point, how you would do this, you say you file a letter objecting to it, and you then have post- -- you have proceedings after the IRS assesses the penalty.   That all makes sense to me as well. The criminal point, Justice Alito's point, you just said the Court could flat-out say that it's not a willful violation when you're challenging the reporting requirement being unlawful.   So that -- we could -- we could say that. Here's where I think I have a concern: On Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander, those cases, you were having a discussion with Justice Kagan, either/or, are you challenging the regulatory aspect of this or the reporting aspect of this, or are you challenging the tax aspect? I think you're challenging both as a plaintiff really.   And what Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander seem to say -- and this supports you -- is that when you're doing that, you have to go -- the AIA applies.   And I -- I agree with you that those cases support you. But I also think Justice Gorsuch makes a very good point that the current philosophy that's -- those cases are from a different era. The current philosophy of challenging administrative action is different, as the Chief Justice said, with presumptions. And, here, where I really think Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander may be different is when the penalties are so high if you lose.   In other words, you have to bet, and if you bet and lose, penalties are so high that it's going to deter you from challenging the regulatory or reporting aspect in the first place. So the bottom -- long-wind up, bottom-line question.   Shouldn't -- as a matter of fairness, modern era of administrative law, presumptions, shouldn't we carve out an exception from Bob Jones, Alexander, Bailey, when the penalties for trying to challenge something are so high that it's going to be coercive and effectively deter you from bringing this kind of challenge in the first place?

And let me say a couple of things about that specifically. I don't think it's right to view Bob Jones and George as out of step with modern interpretation, in particular, because those cases applied the text of the statute and they specifically repudiated brief departures in this Court's history from following the text.   As Bob Jones explained at some length, from page 742 onward, there were periods briefly where the Court didn't follow the text, contrary to what it had done for the first 50 years of the statute.   And the Court returned to that in Bob Jones.   That's what the Court does today, and that's the way the Court should approach this. And in terms of the onset of modern administrative law, I think the APA and Abbott Laboratories are fully consistent with this. Both of those sources recognize that when Congress chooses to make an exception to pre-enforcement review or to -- to channel review in a particular way, that neither the APA nor the principles that Abbott Labs discuss stand in the way.   They expressly recognize that Congress can do that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan C. Bond", "text": " And, finally -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- Barrett. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Bond, earlier you said and you say in your brief that something like the, you know, tax penalties associated with the EPA's fuel standards might be too far downstream to come within this. What is the test for that? I mean, I understand you articulated some of the differences, that this is, you know, housed in another agency but also enforced by these, you know, penalties that are considered taxes. I mean, otherwise you have a pretty bright line.   If it's called a tax, then the AIA applies.   If it's called a penalty, it's not. So, if you're willing to say that there should be some exception or some carveout in that context, like the EPA's fuel standards requirement, well, what would it be and why should we go with a bright line in this circumstance? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan C. Bond", "text": " So I think -- well, I would put it a little bit differently.   I'd say that there is a bright-line rule that covers cases where the complaint on its face seeks relief that would restrain a tax.   That's this case. The question is, how much further beyond that, if at all, does the AIA extend? Now, in our view, it would extend to some extent beyond that where, for example, the suit seeks a declaration that a particular requirement that is backed by taxes is invalid and unlawful and can't be enforced, even if a suit on its face doesn't take the additional step of requesting injunctive relief, because, of course, that declaratory judgment will have the inevitable effect of barring enforcement by the IRS through taxes and it's still fairly imputed to the -- to the suit as a purpose. I think, as you move further along that spectrum, it does become more attenuated. And I think it depends, in particular, on how that other regime works and how it is incorporated into tax law and what relief the plaintiff seeks. But I think the easy path here is to reserve all of those questions and say when the suit on its face seeks to enjoin enforcement by taxes, and that's what Petitioner's suit seeks, it is barred.   And I think you can leave open the question of what happens when a plaintiff seeks relief against one method of enforcement of a requirement that is also enforced by other means. I think the easy way to resolve this case is to apply the text to the situation in front of you, which is straightforward, and leave any of those lingering questions for a different case.

Bond", "text": " Thank you. Petitioner is free to litigate in a refund suit its challenges to the reporting requirements, as other litigants are currently doing with respect to other similar requirements.   And as the Court explained nearly a century ago in Sullivan, pursuing that avenue will not subject it to criminal liability. The Court can avoid any doubt on that score by saying as much in its opinion.   But one thing we know for certain from the statutory text in 6671 is that Congress intended the penalties that Petitioner's suit seeks to render uncollectable to be treated as taxes, the principal effect of which is to make them subject to the AIA. That provision thus represents Congress's judgment that disputes over those penalties belong in refund suits.   Petitioner hasn't offered any way to square its position with that statutory text and the congressional judgment it embodies, nor has it offered any limiting principle that would stop short of subjecting many other reporting requirements backed by taxes to pre-enforcement suits. As it has done in its prior AIA cases, the Court should instead adhere to the statutory text.   The court of appeals' judgment should be affirmed. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Norris? "}, {"speaker": "Cameron T. Norris", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. It's not every day that the United States Government asks citizens to deliberately violate the tax code, but that's my friend's position in this case, and that's a critical distinction for purposes of reaching the right decision here. This is not, as the Anti-Injunction Act normally tells litigants, pay now, litigate later.   This is violate the tax code now, risk jail time and your professional license, and if the IRS agrees to give you a penalty, then litigate later. And the IRS, by the way, the one that has to make the decision about whether you should receive a penalty, is the would-be defendant.   And if my friend is right that we cannot file a single report and just get a $50,000 penalty instead of the tens of millions of dollars of penalties that taking an entire tax year off would cost us, then that gives the IRS a big incentive to never assess that penalty and to deny us our right to go to court. The government's only response to all of this is that it would not be a crime for us to take the route that it offers.   But criminality only really goes to our due process argument.   Our South Carolina versus Regan argument just requires that the governor -- the government's avenue be -- be illegal.   And violating the statutory reporting requirements would certainly be illegal.   My friend never said otherwise in his argument. He did cite a case, Sullivan, about the Fifth Amendment privilege, but that case actually confirms that it is, in fact, unlawful not to file your reports. And Cheek in Footnote 10 distinguishes Fifth Amendment privilege cases and says those are fundamentally different. Now as to -- this -- the government invites this Court to say that it would not be willful for us to take this path, but it has not asked this Court to overrule Cheek, and that's what the Court would have to do to reach that outcome. Cheek draws a clear distinction between taxpayers who do not understand whether the tax code applies to them and taxpayers who know that -- know that it applies to them but believe a provision is invalid. That latter camp, which is clearly where we fall, is a willful violation and would subject us to criminal risks. And I would just close by saying this Court frequently hears arguments from the government that -- don't worry, we won't apply a criminal statute according to its text, but those types of arguments rarely succeed. They've been rejected in cases like Marinello, Stevens, and others.   And this version of that argument from the government is particularly unsatisfying because it took the government until the Supreme Court to make it. It never said that it wouldn't be a crime anywhere below. And the government's argument now directly contradicts Sections 40.05 and 10.05 of the Criminal Tax Manual, which adopts our reading of Cheek and is what live prosecutors would actually use to make charging decisions. We ask that you reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
