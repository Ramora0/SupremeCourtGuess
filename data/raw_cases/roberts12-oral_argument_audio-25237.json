[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case Number 19-123, Fulton versus City of Philadelphia. Ms. Windham. "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The courts below made a simple error. They failed to understand where Employment Division versus Smith controls and where it doesn't.   Smith doesn't control when the government uses a system of individualized exemptions or when it makes other exceptions that undermine its rules or when it changes the rules to prohibit a religious practice. Philadelphia made all three of those errors here.   The City still can't identify a neutral, generally applicable law, even after six attempts.   And it now acknowledges its decisions are subjective and individualized. Yet, the courts below still applied Smith.   They even said Smith would be a dead letter if Petitioners prevailed.   That demonstrates the confusion and instability Smith has caused. Respondents, rather than defend Smith, ask the Court for a newly minted constitutional standard that's even less protective of religious exercise.   That approach has no basis in the text, history, or traditions of the Free Exercise Clause. The City has no compelling reason for excluding Catholic Social Services, which has exercised its faith by serving at-risk children in Philadelphia for two centuries.   Nor does it have any interest in refusing to allow the agency to step aside and provide referrals elsewhere. Yet, Philadelphia is refusing to place children with loving mothers, like Sharonell Fulton and Toni Simms-Busch, just because they chose to partner with an agency who shares their faith. Respondents act as if this is a zero-sum game: Either LGBTQ couples can foster, or Fulton and CSS can.   But the law and decades of experience say otherwise.   The Free Exercise Clause is at the heart of our pluralistic society, and it protects Petitioners' vital work for the Philadelphia community. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Ms. Windham, this is a case involving free exercise rights, but it's in -- they're in tension with another set of rights, those recognized in our decision in Obergefell.   And whatever you think or however you think that tension should be resolved as a matter of government regulation, shouldn't the City get to strike the balance as it wishes when it comes to setting conditions for participating in what is, after all, its foster program? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that that -- that analysis should control here for a couple of different reasons. This Court's precedents make clear that when the government is acting as sovereign using its regulatory authority, like when it's applying a city-wide Fair Practices Ordinance or the ordinances in Lukumi, then the Court does the normal Free Exercise Clause analysis.   The same thing is true when the City is deciding at the outset who's able to participate in a program, like -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So you don't see -- "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " -- Trinity Lutheran. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- you don't see any difference in terms of the analysis whether it's simply a regulation, the City issuing a rule that governs across the board, as opposed to part of the rules for participating in a program; in other words, not in its sovereign capacity but in a managerial capacity or, you know, a business capacity? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " The City isn't acting in one of those capacities here, and I think a key fact here is the fact that they are relying on the Fair Practices Ordinance.   The fact that they put that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but do you think there are -- "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " -- into a new context -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- do you think there are different rules in those two different contexts? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, if you had a situation which is unlike Lukumi, unlike licensing, unlike Trinity Lutheran or Espinoza, when the government is managing internal affairs, then the government's interests may be stronger. But, here, Philadelphia has said that CSS is an independent contractor and is not an employee or agent of the City.   That's -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " -- in its old contract. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, following up on the Chief Justice's question, this seems to involve both contractual relationships with the City, as well as, as the Chief said, regulatory or licensing. In that instance, when you have both aspects of that, do we analyze it as a government contract, again, referring back to the Chief's point, or as sort of a licensure program where the City has basically taken over an area and now it has certain requirements of the -- the regulated industry? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Justice Thomas, as Your Honor acknowledged there at the end, the City is trying to regulate an area that has historically been an area of religious practice, and so I think that that sets this case apart from many cases the City is citing.   It's correct they're using regulatory authority, they're using sovereign authority, they're using licensing authority to decide who gets to participate. Those are cases where this Court's precedents have said you do the normal constitutional analysis.   There's not some special rule. And, here, where both the old contracts and the new contracts say that we're not an employee or agent of the City, the same analysis should apply here as did in Lukumi and Espinoza and Trinity Lutheran. This is different from a case like, say, Bowen, where you're trying to reach out as a third-party and tell the City how to run its internal affairs. Here, the City is reaching out and telling a private religious ministry which has been doing this work for two centuries how to run its internal affairs and trying to coerce it to make statements that are contrary to its religious beliefs as a condition of continuing to participate in the religious exercise that they have carried out in Philadelphia for two centuries. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes.   Thank you. On pages 45 and 46 of the City's brief, they say that they aren't requiring you to endorse same-sex marriages.   They say all they're asking you to do is evaluate a couple without reference to whether they are same-sex or not. You've read that.   It says your objection is to being required to evaluate and provide written endorsements of a same-sex relationship.   But they aren't saying to do that.   Indeed, they say add something onto any response you make and say that you do not endorse same-sex marriages.   Say it. You see what it says.   So suppose pages 45 and 46 were written right into your contract, allowing you to say whatever you want about same-sex.   All they want you to do is evaluate this couple irrespective of same or different sex. What is your religious objection to that? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " So, Justice Breyer, I'm going to point Your Honor to the Joint Appendix at 210 to 211 and then 237, where that very question was asked. And the head of Catholic Social Services testified that certifying a home of a same-sex couple would be in violation of that religious belief, that a home study is essentially a validation of the relationships in the home, and that a final home study includes a written endorsement of the relevant relationships of the foster parent. And the state law as well asks an agency -- agency to assess the ability of applicants for approval as foster parents. What the City is asking CSS to do here is to certify, validate, and make statements that it cannot make.   And I'm not aware of any case where this Court has said it's okay to compel speech or coerce religious exercise as long as you can tag a disclaimer onto the end of it.   Respondents certainly haven't cited to any. It would be hurtful for CSS and for the couple, if any couple ever approached them, for them to go into their home, assess their relationships, interview them about their intimate relationships and their family, and then, at the end of that, have to say we cannot provide that approval for you and your family. CSS is making a modest request here, which is to step aside and be able to allow diverse religious agencies to serve the City of Philadelphia, as they have done successfully for many years. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, you don't have to say, according to them, whether the couple is married, whether it's not married, whether it's same-sex, whether it's different sex.   You just put that to the side, make a note that you're putting it to the side, and say, other than that, they're okay or they're not okay.   That's all you have to do. Now what's the problem? I still don't quite see it.   You said in your response that you don't want to do it, which I understand that you don't.   But they say they're imposing a requirement that does not interfere with your -- they can't figure out how does it interfere. And so we write 45 and 46 right into your contract word for word. And now tell me once again what's the problem.   You -- in your last answer, you just said they can't make you say anything.   I guess that's true.   But we write 45 and 46 and say you can say something if you want, or you don't have to if you don't want to, but just take same-sex, different sex, and put it to the side and say, other than that, are they qualified. "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " What they're still being asked to do is to evaluate, assess, and approve of a couple under -- under state law.   And in their own written report, that's something that they have testified that they cannot do. This is also not an unknown or unusual religious belief.   Eleven states have passed laws to specifically protect religious child welfare providers in this context.   As the USCCB brief points out, there have been agency closures across the country over this very issue. What we're asking here -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Let me ask you a couple of questions about what's in the record of this case about the facts of the case. To begin, as far as the record reflects, how many same-sex couples in Philadelphia have been denied the opportunity to be foster parents as a result of Catholic Social Services' policy? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Zero.   In fact, Justice Alito, none have even approached Catholic Social Services asking for this approval and endorsement. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Before the events at issue now, how many children had been placed -- were in homes that had been evaluated by Catholic Social Services? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " At the time of the referral freeze, there were well over 100 children who were currently being served, and over the years, there had been thousands who had been served by Catholic Social Services. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " How many children are awaiting placement in foster homes in Philadelphia? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " According to the City of Philadelphia, at the time when they froze intake for CSS, there were 250 children who were in group homes who needed to be moved out of those homes and into family homes.   This is in the best interests of the children.   It's actually an obligation under state law. But Commissioner Figueroa, at page 352 to 53 of the JA, acknowledged that those children were still in group homes and that those children were not going to be moved into homes that are supported by Catholic Social Services. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " One of your main arguments concerns a -- the fact that there are exemptions to the generally applicable rules under the City's policy. I'm somewhat uncertain about what the City's final position is about the availability of exemptions.   What is your understanding of that? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Justice Alito, I understand that there are individualized exemptions from provision 3.21 of the contract, and also through the Waiver Exemption Committee, that there are categorical exemptions.   Whenever an agency conducts a home study, they have to consider disability, marital status, and familial status.   That's prohibited by the City's Fair Practices Ordinance. And so those are the -- and the City itself actually deviates from the Fair Practices Ordinance, even though it is bound by it, when it is making placement decisions in foster care. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, do they make the exemptions at the initial stage or only at the placement stage? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Justice Alito, the City's exemptions are at the placement stage. But, for the agencies, those exemptions are happening when they're carrying out the home studies, so the exact same point in the process that the City is trying to coerce Catholic Social Services here. And, of course, the Waiver and Exemption Committee could, in theory, give them at any stage. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, I'm interested in why you see yourself as a licensee as opposed to a government contractor.

I'd like to take you back to the Chief Justice's opening questions and give you a hypothetical. Suppose that there's a state and it doesn't want to operate its prisons itself, so it contracts with private organizations to do so.   And in the contract, there's a provision that says that no employee can use drugs of any kind.   And -- and a -- a -- a -- a group says -- that wants to operate a prison says it wants an exemption for peyote use.   What would be the result in that case? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Well, Justice Kagan, I think, to know the result in that case, first of all, we would have to know whether the government's rules there are neutral and generally applicable.   I believe the free exercise analysis would apply. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, you know, I guess the question that I'm trying to get at is here's the government in its capacity as a contractor saying, you know, something -- a condition that's extremely relevant to the contract in its view, and shouldn't the government have leeway to do that, to just say, you know, it doesn't matter why you want to use peyote, whether it's religious or anything else; we're just going to say there -- there should be no peyote use and no other drug use. "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Justice Kagan, I think that the state would be likely to prevail in that case for a couple of reasons. One is that, unlike here, the government's interests are going to be a lot stronger.   The government there is actually taking something that's traditionally a public function and handing it out to private organizations, as opposed to here, taking -- moving in and increasingly regulating and restricting work that has traditionally been private. Second -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But there are a lot -- "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " -- there, they -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- of things that governments do now.   If you would excuse me, Ms. Windham, just to put another question on the table.   I mean, there are a lot of things that governments do now that traditionally were done by private organizations, religious organizations.   I mean, you could go through, you know, youth homes or homeless shelters.   A lot of old philanthropy is now regulated and conducted by the government. Why should that matter? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Justice Kagan, because I think that really points out the question in this case: Does the Free Exercise Clause shrink every time the government expands its reach and begins to regulate work that has historically and traditionally been done by religious groups?

Would that make a difference to you? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Justice Kagan, I think it would make a difference.   I think the history here is important.   I think that when you're looking at the government's interest in that case, that would be relevant too.

"}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Justice Gorsuch, I think that that's a very important fact here because, if we're going to take the City at its word there, what it means is that we've stepped out of the contracting context now and we are firmly in the regulating context.

The district court said that it was a generally applicable law as long as it didn't prescribe particular conduct only or primarily when religiously motivated.   You can see that at Petition Appendix 87.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " If we thought that were a finding of fact and -- and we were stuck with it, then -- then what would you argue? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " I would argue in that case, if the Court did think it was a finding of fact, that under the Court's decisions in Hurley and Bose, in a First Amendment case, the Court is going to make an independent review of the record.   And that's particularly pertinent here, where we're talking about the words of a contract, the words of a city law, the words of a state regulation.   This is the work-a-day business of the courts to interpret and apply the law. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And with respect to section -- oh, I see my time's expired.   Thank you.

I want to follow up on some of Justice Alito's questions and just make sure I have some of the facts down pat here. First, as I understand it, Philadelphia contracts with about 30 private foster agencies to find and train and support foster families, and Catholic Social Services is just one of them, as I understand it. And, second, if a same-sex couple ever came to Catholic Social Services, Catholic Social Services would refer that couple to another agency that works with same-sex couples so that the couple could participate and be a foster -- foster parents. And then, third, no same-sex couple has ever come to Catholic Social Services for participation in this program, and, therefore, Catholic Social Services' policy has never actually denied any same-sex couple the opportunity to be foster parents in Philadelphia. I just want to make sure those three facts are accurate, and you can elaborate as you see fit. "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " That's all correct, Justice Kavanaugh.   And that demonstrates, first, that CSS is not going to prevent any same-sex couple from being able to foster in Philadelphia.   There are many other agencies out there.   They're merely asking to be able to step aside and recuse if that situation ever to -- were ever to arise. It also demonstrates the City doesn't have a compelling interest here.   This is a system that has worked effectively and worked well for many years.   This is an unnecessary conflict.   The City of Philadelphia had an easy option here, which is to allow Catholic Social Services to continue the great work that it's been doing. Unfortunately, because the courts below decided to apply Employment Division v. Smith, the City thinks that it's under no obligation to consider, respect, and accommodate religious exercise, which demonstrates how far off the rails our free exercise jurisprudence has gone in this case.

So you just kind of indicated that -- you know, that maybe Smith shouldn't have been applied here, and you argue in your brief that Smith should be overruled.

So, if you're right about that, why should we even entertain the question whether to overrule Smith? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Justice Barrett, you're exactly right that we can and should win this case even under Smith.   The question then to the Court will be how it resolves the legal question and what guidance it provides to the courts below. This Court in cases like Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza looks to the text, history, and traditions of the Free Exercise Clause, and those make clear that Smith is a bad fit.   Smith has caused negative results. Developments since Smith was decided make clear that its prediction has actually not borne out, that it is possible for the government to accommodate and partner with religious organizations to do religious exercise.

In cases like the Ministerial Exception or Church Autonomy, the Court doesn't even look at the Smith/Lukumi line of cases.   In cases like Lukumi and Trinity Lutheran, the Court has looked at the non-neutrality or targeting. But, in other cases, I think the question should be pretty simple: Is the free exercise of -- is the free exercise of religion being prohibited and, if so, does the government have a compelling reason for doing so? Here, the government does not. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Last question: If we did overrule Smith or, frankly, even if we didn't, let's take this out of the same-sex marriage context and put it in the interracial marriage context.   Justice Sotomayor was indicating an example like this. What if there was an agency who believed that interracial marriage was an offense against God and, therefore, objected to certifying interracial couples as foster families? Would they be entitled to an exemption and, if so, how is that distinguishable from -- or, if not, how is that distinguishable from CSS's refusal to certify children to couples in same-sex marriages? "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " No, Your Honor.   If that case were even to get to strict scrutiny, this Court has been clear in Loving and other cases that government has a compelling interest in eradicating racial discrimination.

Windham", "text": " Philadelphia will make exceptions to its rules for lots of reasons but not for the reason of CSS's religious exercise. Regardless of the legal mechanism that Philadelphia uses, the bottom line is that CSS is breaking the City's law if it even refers same-sex couples to another agency better suited to help them. And, as a result, Philadelphia won't place children with Sharonell Fulton, Toni Simms-Busch, or CSS unless their church changes or violates its beliefs. In our pluralistic society, a properly functioning Free Exercise Clause is supposed to prevent this kind of unnecessary and harmful conflict.   There are children in need of loving homes waiting for them.   Neither Philadelphia nor Smith should stand in the way. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mooppan. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M.

The City refuses to place foster children in available foster homes certified by CSS simply because, if CSS were ever asked to certify a gay couple, it would respectfully decline and refer them to another foster agency. The City's draconian response to CSS's hypothetical position discriminates against religious exercise for two reasons. First, the City lacks a generally applicable rule because it seeks to apply a non-discrimination requirement to CSS despite having exempted comparable secular conduct, thereby devaluing CSS's religious concerns. Second, the City has not neutrally applied this rule because it has shown undue disrespect to CSS's sincere religious beliefs by pleading a win-win accommodation as too odious to tolerate.

But, on the flip side, I think it's important to emphasize that the City's rules do consider disability when certifying foster parents.   So foster parents can be denied the ability to serve as foster parents because of their disability. So, again, the City is allowing that sort of dignitary harm that Your Honor pointed to, and they're saying that sometimes that dignitary harm isn't enough, but they are not willing to allow that to happen in this context, where it's a totally hypothetical harm and whereby enforcing that hypothetical harm, they're actually harming the children they purport to serve.

The facts we have in this case are that there are dozens of foster agencies that are available to serve gay couples in the City of Philadelphia.   And there's no evidence that any gay couple has ever even tried to use CSS as its agency. So, on the one hand, what Philadelphia is doing here doesn't even help gay couples.

Mooppan", "text": " So, Your Honor, in this case, the -- the City claims to be enforcing its Fair Practice Ordinance, which list -- prohibits differentiation or preference in the treatment of a person on the basis of a string of protected traits, and they recognize exemptions for a variety of those traits. Now it's true that there isn't an example of them recognizing exemptions for sexual orientation, but unless they could say that for some reason sexual orientation discrimination is the one type of discrimination under which they can abide no exemptions whatsoever, even more so than race, even more so than disability, it reveals that those are comparable traits and they're recognizing exemptions in other contexts for the best interests of the child. But, here, when the children would be better served by recognizing an exemption for CSS that would allow CSS to continue to provide this work, the City refuses to do so. That is the sort of lack of religious tolerance and the lack of neutrality that cases like Lukumi and Fraternal Order of Police in the Third Circuit are focused on. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " What if the ordinance said expressly that there shall be no exemptions permitted with respect to the same-sex marriage anti-discrimination requirement, period, and then had another section which permitted some exceptions as the City employs here, like in considering race, for example, in the placement of a child?

I think we would still say that in that case, in the absence of any argument for why sexual orientation is the one form of discrimination that can't abide any exceptions, even more so than race, that the City was essentially making a value judgment in the same way that in Lukumi the City allowed killing for certain reasons but not other reasons.   You can always imagine parsing out the statute in a different way and sort of gerrymandering the statute so that the provision that's being applied to the religious entity has no exemptions and that it's other sub-provisions that have all the exemptions. Ultimately, though, the question is whether the government is devaluing religious interests vis-\u00e0-vis secular interests.   And we think that's what's happening here, because the government is recognizing exemptions for the best interests of the children but not doing it -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Thank you.

What it is doing is cutting off homes from the most vulnerable children in the City to spite the Catholic Church. The government itself requires, tolerates, and itself engages in various forms of discrimination on the basis of protected traits for the best interests of children.   But then it turns around and refuses to abide by any form of discrimination with respect to sexual orientation in order to deny an accommodation for the Catholic Church. And the statements that have been made by various officials make clear that the reason they're doing that is that they view this as some sort of odious anachronism rather than, as this Court has recognized, a decent and honorable view that people can recognize and accept in a country that's committed to religious tolerance.

"}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is not about private activity or beliefs.   When an FCA signs a taxpayer-funded contract, it is delegated government power to inspect and approve foster families under Section 3700 of the Pennsylvania Code. A universal clause in every contract bars sexual orientation discrimination when carrying out that delegated power.   That clause contains no exceptions, and it applies equally to every FCA, religious and secular alike. CSS says the Constitution compelled the City to give it a different contract.   There is no precedent for such a thing.   This is, as the Chief Justice said, the City's own program and its own wards of the state. The government has broad powers to impose conditions on contractors like CSS that stand in the government's shoes performing government functions. Ms. Windham even admitted that the government has more leeway as a contractor.   She just says CSS isn't one.   That's all the debate narrows down to, and the contract is clear that they are. Ruling otherwise would insert federal courts into contracting decisions in all 50 states and imperil government services in many spheres.   It means FCAs could discriminate against LGBT kids or categorically against foster parents on gender or religion. Justice Sotomayor asked that question, apart from race, and I didn't quite hear a response from the other side. And this is not a hypothetical.   The district court's hearing revealed CSS to require a clergy letter showing foster parents were active members of a congregation.   Other FCAs discriminate by religion, such as against Catholics and Jews in South Carolina. Petitioners' rule would compel governments to permit all these practices, balkanizing foster care agencies and ending their openness to all. And, finally, CSS says it was targeted for its beliefs, but the district court found, after three days of live testimony, that never happened.   The Third Circuit agreed.   And nothing my friends have said comes close to the very obvious and exceptional showing of error that the two-court rule requires to reverse that. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And we certainly, I think, have come across the idea of foster parents, and we said they can't request a particular race.   I'm not sure if we've had the question of the child itself. But I do want to say that's a very different thing.   As Justice Alito was saying, that child matching stage, at that stage, you're looking to the best interests.   This case is about the pool stage and who is eligible at all to be a foster parent.   And the record is clear -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I suppose you -- there are certainly different contexts, but the question is at least in certain contexts, you are comfortable with the concept -- concept of discriminating in this program on the basis of sexual orientation, but you have a very strict rule, you've said there will be no exceptions to CSS's similar taking into account of the sexual orientation status of the would-be parent -- foster parents. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " No -- no, Mr. Chief Justice, it's the same rule at both stages.   So, at the pool stage, there's no -- there's -- there's a categorical bar against any discrimination.   It's always up to the parents' choice to work with an FCA. Now, at the child matching stage, that looks to the best interests of the child, like the federal standard and that in all 50 states. That doesn't categorically exclude anyone.   It looks to all potentially relevant considerations. And what my friend on the other side is doing is taking one thing, which is the very, very narrow, limited use of race, that's taken into account as part of the best interests of the child, which is mandated by state law.   And I asked the City, when have you ever taken race into account? They could only find one instance, and that was when a kid used racial slurs, so they avoided that placement of the kid with someone of that race. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

"}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Absolutely, Justice Thomas.   That would be a very different case, that because this is the contracting circumstance, the government has far more leeway in what is actually similar when you heard all of those things about race and disability and the like.   Umbehr says courts must give deference to the government's reasonable assessments of its interests as contractor. And so, when you're looking to what is similar and what is different, I think it's very important to understand that it's not similar in the Lukumi sense. The government is saying that that -- those distinctions made on the best interests of the child are made at a point when their interests are very different.   It's about matching kids, not growing the pool of safe foster parents. And it's not discrimination.   The government is saying, at that point, it's done to protect the welfare of an individual child and is nothing like the across-the-board flat refusal that they wanted here. So, look, if a Catholic teen wanted to be with a Catholic family at the teen -- excuse me -- at the child matching stage, that could be taken into account.   Lots of things can be taken into account at that stage. But, here, we're talking about that first stage, as Justice Alito said.

What's actually bothering me quite a lot about this case is I think that no family has ever been turned down by this agency.   Indeed, none has ever applied, no gay family, no gay couple.

And you're willing to have them say, but taking gay into account, you don't have to take it into account at all, but they don't want to do that. Now that seems to me a very narrow ground for deciding a case that has enormous implications.   Could you not say, hey, we think if there ever were a gay couple and it really was a problem, you'd have to do something about it, like look into it and don't say gay?

I mean, the natural thing for me would be to say, okay, you say what you want, we'll say what we want, and if it ever comes up, we'll deal with it.   But it never has. Now is there any way that that has anything to do with how we would decide this case? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Justice Breyer, this has actually come up.   Bethany, the other FCA, turned a couple away.   That's what led to the newspaper article in this entire set of events. And in response, I think the City acted reasonably.   It had been aware of CSS's religious beliefs for decades -- that's Joint Appendix page 165 -- but had never stopped the contract because it thought that CSS was operating within the contract terms.   They took CSS at its word, until they learned otherwise. And it was at that point that the City said: We're worried about being -- making the City itself a party to discrimination.   And even then, they didn't declare a breach.   Rather, they just said the next annual contract we won't renew because they're telling us, after our investigation, they won't fulfill the terms of the contract. But, notably, of the 17 -- 19 million dollars they gave CSS for foster care, they took two away for this child pool -- excuse me -- the parent pool function, but they left the rest intact.   And to this day, CSS is getting 26 million dollars a year from the City, which is hardly something demonstrating religious hostility, and that is for foster care and -- and child services. So I think the City took that reasonable, limited action, and they certainly don't need to wait for an instance of discrimination with respect to this particular entity.   I mean, in NASA versus Nelson, there was no evidence of drug abuse, but the government still insisted on tests, and this Court was unanimous in saying that was okay. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

That's why we're giving them 26 million dollars a year to do so.   We tremendously value what they're doing. We weren't looking for some sort of fight here.   Obviously, the City was torn up about it.

You wouldn't even need it because I think we would win even in the sovereign context, but I think the fact -- what you'd be asking is, is this really a similar circumstance at the pool stage or at the child matching stage.   And there are really different interests -- that's what the government is saying -- and different harms. An across-the-board flat refusal of a government agency to say, hey, the doors are closed to you entirely is very different from the sort of individualized best interests of the child determination that they are focusing on. And, you know, they focus on disability as well, but that absolutely misstates the record because it's state law that requires foster care agencies to have a special license for disability needs.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Katyal, I'm concerned about Section 3.21 of the contract. So the 2019 version of the contract says -- and I'm quoting here -- \"that an agency shall not reject prospective foster or adoptive parents for services based on sexual orientation unless an exception is granted by the Commissioner in his or her sole discretion.\" So why isn't that exactly the kind of exemption that CSS wants here? And why doesn't its presence, you know, undermine this -- the -- the state's purported interests? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Your Honor, the district court looked into this and found that DHS has never made an exception to its non-discrimination requirement, including under 3.21, because, with 3.2 -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, let's say that that's true, Mr. Katyal, I mean, that no exemption has ever been granted under that provision.   I mean, I read Smith and Lukumi to say that you -- you can't get out of it so easily, that as long as there is an exemption, as long as it exists, as long as you could rely on it in the future, that there is not neutrality here. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, I disagree both on the law and then with respect to the facts. So, with respect to the law, Your Honor, Smith doesn't say that the mere existence of a system triggers strict scrutiny. It says you can't give exemptions discriminatorily.   So, if the City was exempting secular organizations from non-discrimination rules but not religious ones, that would be what would trigger strict scrutiny. And we know this because Smith said an across-the-board criminal prohibition is paradigmatic of something that is generally applicable, but that's also obviously the paradigmatic example of something with exemptions and broad discretion, as this Court's opinions in Armstrong and McCleskey recognize. And with respect to 3.21, Your Honor, it does two basic things. First, it says that it bars FCAs from rejecting a referral from DHS.   And a referral can only be from DHS.   And, indeed, their blue brief at page 13 admits that. And then the second thing it does is it says DHS can make an exception to that.   It says, \"providers shall not reject a child unless an exception is granted by the Commissioner.\" So that's about, like, if the child lives far away or something like that, we're not going to force the FCA to take it, but there's nothing about any sort of categorical or classified -- classification on race or gender or anything like that with respect to 3.21. And it certainly hasn't happened in practice, which is actually, I think, the standard of Smith. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Katyal. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

There seems to be some lack of clarity about which stage we're at here, whether we're at the matching stage or at the screening stage.

And at least in the government contracting case, it's not similar in the Lukumi sense because the City is saying -- and I think it gets a lot of deference -- under Umbehr, our City interests are different.   We're about trying to grow the number of maximum safe foster parents, and policies like this deter and block LGBT parents from coming in and send signals to LGBT youth. At the matching stage, of course, it's -- first of all, you're complying with state law, so it's a very different thing, the best interests of the child, but, second, that's a much more particularized inquiry. And, again, it applies evenhandedly. It just may be that it's in the really rarest of instances, like the one example I was able to give you, you know, you might take a protected classification into account. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Good morning, Mr. Katyal.   I have kind of a bigger picture thought to express, and you can react as -- as you wish. It seems like this case requires us to think about the balance between two very important rights recognized by this Court, the religious exercise and belief right, obviously, in the First Amendment, and the same-sex marriage right, as recognized in Obergefell. And it seems when those rights come into conflict, all levels of government should be careful and should often, where possible and appropriate, look for ways to accommodate both interests in reasonable ways.   It's a very -- you know it's very sensitive, controversial. There are strong -- very strong feelings on all sides that warrant respect. And it seems like we and governments should be looking, where possible, for win-win answers, recognizing that neither side is going to win completely on these issues given the First Amendment on the one hand and given Obergefell on the other. But, when I look at this case, that's not at all what happened here.   It seems like Philadelphia created a clash, it seems, and was looking for a fight and has brought that serious, controversial fight all the way to the Supreme Court even though no same-sex couple had gone to CSS, even though 30 agencies are available for same-sex couples, and even though CSS would refer any same-sex couple to one of those other agencies. And to be clear, I fully appreciate the stigmatic harm.   I completely understand that, fully appreciate it.   But we need to find a balance that also respects religious beliefs. That was the promise explicitly written by the Court in Obergefell and in Masterpiece, explicitly promised that respect for religious beliefs. And what I fear here is that the absolutist and extreme position that you're articulating would require us to go back on the promise of respect for religious believers. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So, Justice Kavanaugh, four things. First, we absolutely agree with you that these are feelings that warrant respect, and, you know, both of these rights are important, and we share that same spirit. Second, I don't think the framing of this as religion versus same-sex equality is the right one.   The way the City sees this is actually a case about religion versus religion because, if you accept what the -- what their argument is, then they'll allow -- you know, another -- another FCA can say we won't allow Baptists, we won't allow Buddhists, or we'll only allow those things. And in that sense, religion will be pitted against religion.   Foster care agencies will be balkanized.   And this will be true not just in foster care but in any number of other areas in which the government contracts. Third, practically, I don't think you can look at this and just say, oh, this is a small, tiny accommodation, what's the harm in it, because any individual accommodation will look reasonable. The problem is, as Chief Justice Burger's unanimous opinion in United States versus Lee says, once you do it for one objector, the Court's going to be stuck doing it for all. I mean, the accommodation there was a pittance.   It was someone objecting to paying Social Security.   But the Court said income tax will be next, and you can't have a workable system, either for Social Security payments or now for FCAs, with so many religious accommodations. And then, lastly, when you say the City was looking for a fight or something, we couldn't profoundly disagree more.   We certainly didn't rush this case to the Supreme Court. Indeed, we won it in both courts below and the first one, after a three-day hearing looking at live testimony, looking at precisely the allegations you said about religious hostility, and all of those dissolved. And, indeed, I think -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Barrett. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Katyal.   I just want to be sure that I'm clear in thinking about this question of whether the City was functioning as a contractor or whether it was granting licenses. Is it possible for any entity to participate in the recruitment and certification of foster families without a contract from the City? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Not with respect to this function, and so I think that's a very important point about what Ms. Windham said.   She kept on saying we've been doing this for two centuries, this.   Private entities have never done this because whatever these entities did before, like CSS, they never selected who cares for kids in City custody, applying state criteria. Indeed, the whole point of the modern foster care system is to bring responsibility for those kids inside the government and not to leave it into the private hands.   I mean, these are wards of the state, and the City has the highest interests in screening parents. So this isn't an example at all of something that could be described as a licensee function, because a licensee is someone, you know, when someone's licensed, like to practice law or run a barber shop, they're not carrying out the government's work, they're performing their own work, a private profession, with the permission of the government. This is the opposite of that, Justice Barrett.   This is about the City's own kids, and the City's interests here are at their zenith. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well, let's imagine that the state takes over all hospitals and says from now on, you know, we are going to be responsible for hospitals, but we will contract with private entities to actually run them. And so there's a Catholic hospital and gets a contract with the City to run it.   In fact, it's a -- a Catholic hospital that's in existence before the state adopts this policy. And its contract with the state provides that there are -- in the contract the state gives everyone is that you can get some exceptions for some medical procedures, but every hospital has to perform abortions. In that context, do we analyze this as a licensing question, or, given that the Catholic hospital can't even enter the business without this contract, do you still say that this was the provision of a contractual service? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So three things, Your Honor. First, this isn't -- just factually, this is not a monopolization case at all, contrary to what my friend says.   After all, they still have 26 million dollars, the lion's share of their foster care budget.   So it's not as if we're occupying the field or something -- something like that. With respect to your hypothetical, I think there are two problems.   One is I think the real thing that does the force in the hypothetical is the government somehow monopolizing a private care system, a healthcare system or hospital system.   That itself would raise any number of constitutional problems. And I think our intuition as to why that hypothetical sounds so horrible is because of that.   That's what does the work. And secondly -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " A minute to wrap up, Mr. Katyal. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " I'd say three things are notable. First, this case, I think, as Justice Scalia might say, comes as a wolf.   Petitioners' rule would enable an FCA to exclude parents of any religion, from Buddhist to Baptist.   And this Court, because it can't second-guess the reasonableness of a belief, it opens the door to all sorts of claims, indeed, this very case, the clergy letter, and it radiates far beyond foster care to all government contracts in all 50 states. Second, the City would act the very same way if a secular FCA discriminated, and the flip side is true too.   The City contracts with Bethany, which is open to same-sex couples despite its religious opposition.   And the City continues to contract with CSS to the tune of 26 million dollars. These three indicia -- a uniform policy, continued contracting with Bethany, and continued contracting with CSS itself -- are strong evidence the two courts below got it right. And, finally, my friends never overcome the two-court rule on neutrality. After three days of live testimony, the trial court found the preponderance of evidence favored the City. For these reasons, we ask the unanimous judgment of the Third Circuit be affirmed. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think what makes this feel like a hard case is that CSS is doing valuable work, it is acting based on traditional religious beliefs, and it may appear that the costs of accommodating it would not be too high. But that overlooks two serious problems with CSS's claim. First, CSS is not acting in its private capacity but, rather, as a government contractor.   Its claim, therefore, implicates the government's managerial interests, as well as the imperative that governmental services are made evenhandedly available to all citizens. And, second, free exercise claims cannot turn on judicial assessments of whether religious views are honorable or offensive.   If the Constitution requires an accommodation here, as Mr. Katyal said, all manner of other allowances must be made for foster care and other service agencies. And because there's no constitutional difference between independent contractors and government employees, CSS's position would also imply, for example, that police officers could decline on religious grounds to enforce particular laws, prison guards could insist on evangelizing to inmates. The implications go on and on, but the upshot is this: Whatever rules might govern free exercise claims outside of government contracting, the City's anti-discrimination requirement is constitutional because it is a reasonable rule governing the selection of those who will care for children in the City's custody. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Fisher, suppose that the City of Philadelphia decides that it doesn't like the message that the church having an all male priesthood -- the message that that conveys.   It doesn't want to expose foster children to that belief in foster parents.   And so it terminates CSS's contract because of the church's -- that church -- the church's belief in that respect. Are they free to do that? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " I think there would be two big differences between that and this case, Mr. Chief Justice. Number one, as the Court recognized in Hosanna-Tabor and the like, clergy members of the church and the way that they are structured within the church raise Establishment Clause questions and free exercise questions that are entirely different from a government contracting scenario like this on -- on their own terms. And, second of all, I don't understand any way that that rule would relate to the carrying out of foster care services.   The core problem, the core question here is whether the government is imposing a reasonable condition -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

But the most important thing I would tell you here is that you don't even have to ask that question.   The Court recognized before Smith itself, in cases like Lyng and Roy, that when we're dealing with internal affairs of the government and its own operations, that a simple -- a different test applies. And the test that I would say governs this case, which is really quite narrow in this sense because it's a government contracting case, is the test the Court made -- laid out in NASA versus Nelson, where the Court asked whether it was a reasonable rule that the government was insisting for its contractors. And, actually, the Court in that case used the phrase \"internal operations.\" So all you have to do is put Nelson together with Lyng and Roy, which tell you that the Free Exercise Clause allows the government the same power when it deals with its internal operations.

And the government, as Justice Kagan said earlier, can take over certain operations. Indeed, the City, as Justice Sotomayor said, could do the certification itself. But also I want to answer, Justice Alito, in terms of the history, and I want to echo what my friend, Mr. Katyal, said, which is that, yes, the same term, \"foster care,\" is used that was used historically, but it's a completely different program now because the children are in city custody and we're talking about selecting people -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And this goes back to Justice Barrett's earlier question about how to define the field.   There are still foster parents that -- private placement with foster parents that CSS can still engage in.   The only children that in the -- in the state's custody are those that have been essentially abandoned or taken away from their parents, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L.

But -- but the thing I would want to make sure I stress, Justice Sotomayor, is that even if the other side were right that the City, however you would want to look at this, has occupied the field of parental certifications, it would make it no different than Lyng.   It would make it no different than Nelson.   It would make it no different than Garcetti, where the government occupies the field of prosecutions. The government occupies the field of law enforcement.

If one wanted to find a compromise in this case, can you suggest one that wouldn't do real damage to all the various lines of law that have been implicated here? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Well, I think, Justice Sotomayor, the place to start in that respect would be where Justice Breyer started earlier today with the City's concession at pages 45 and 46 of its brief that if what CSS is concerned about is a perception that by participating in this program they are endorsing marriage for same-sex couples, that they can disclaim that and make very clear that all they're doing is following state law and to carry out a government function on the government's behalf and they're not purporting to speak for themselves in any certifications. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Fisher, the -- the solicitor general's main argument here is that the City has undermined its asserted interests in non-discrimination by having a series of other exemptions to the one that's at issue -- to the one that -- other exemptions that -- similar to what CSS wants. And I talked with Mr. Katyal about 3.21.   The solicitor general also references various policies that have to do with placing children, consideration of race and disability at that stage. So I was wondering if you could explain to me why those are permissible, but -- but the City should not be able to give an exemption to CSS? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Of course, Justice Kagan. Let me say one thing about the law and then give you a broad-stroke answer and any specifics I'm happy to answer. First, the solicitor general, I think, somewhat strangely tried to put entirely aside the contracting context of this case in asking these questions about general applicability.   As the Court said in Umbehr, the Court has to give reasonable deference to government's assessment of its own interests in the contracting space. So even in this general applicability context, Justice Kagan, I want to stress that the government contexting -- I'm sorry, the government contracting context is highly relevant to this comparability inquiry that is required.   And I don't think the solicitor general even denied that. And I'll just say in broad strokes the purported exemptions that the other side points to when it comes to the certification process simply do not exist.   The closest they've come is to talk about disability being taken into account, but it's not disability that's taken into account.   It's just the criteria that I discussed with Justice Thomas that are neutral and secular as to the ability to care for a child to which disability is sometimes relevant. That leaves child placement.   And in child placement, it's just a different set of rules that apply because that's a different stage of the process.   And so the key answer there is that the City has reasonably concluded that that's just not a comparable setting because the best interests of the child in matching somebody on an individualized basis kicks in.   And that's not the scenario at the certification stage, where all we're asking is whether somebody can care for children. And back to the question about a compromise, CSS has not disputed that same-sex couples are equally able to care for children. And so we think the placement scenario is just entirely different. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Fisher. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Gorsuch. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I'd -- I'd like you to expand on that just a little bit further, Mr. Fisher. One of the challenges of Smith, of course, is asking whether there's an exception, and that raises all sorts of questions about at what level of generality should we look and what's comparable enough. Why isn't the 3.21 matching process in that contract process sufficiently like the screening process that we should consider it? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Justice Gorsuch, I think for two reasons that I'd stress. One is, as I understand Section 3.21, it applies to referrals from DHS.   That is not the certification process.   That is the matching process or similar situations. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I -- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " And so the same answer that I just gave to Justice Kagan -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'll -- I accept the legal point that they're different stages in the process, formally speaking, legally. But why -- why -- why shouldn't we take cognizance of it when we're doing the Smith analysis? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Okay.   Well, let me answer it this way then.   Smith did not say the mere availability in the air of the individualized treatment is enough to make it not a generally applicable law because, as Mr. Katyal said, then the criminal law itself would not be a neutral, generally applicable law. You have to have some disparate treatment of religious reasons versus secular reasons.   That's what Justice Alito said in the Fraternal Order of Police opinion the solicitor general relies on, that it's not okay to let people wear beards for medical reasons but not for religious reasons. And so, as the -- as the Volokh brief also described, it's not just whether in the air there's a possibility for exceptions or different -- differential treatment.   It's whether you've actually had such treatment, because otherwise you just simply don't have a workable system of law. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Good morning, Mr. Fisher, and welcome.   Thank you for your -- and I want to thank all the parties for their excellent briefs and arguments and all the amicus briefs, which have all been very valuable in thinking through these issues. Just a couple questions to just confirm a couple things factually here.   You agree, I assume, that Catholic Social Services does important, valuable work for vulnerable foster children in Philadelphia? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Of -- of course, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And then do you agree that a same-sex couple in Philadelphia can become foster parents by going to one of the 30 agencies?

"}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh, no, I don't as a factual matter, but remember that a same-sex couple was turned away from Bethany. And the -- and the caution I would give you to rely too heavily on this 30-agency idea is that, remember, we don't know how many agencies will discriminate against people based on sexual orientation, religion, or other characteristics if the City is required to grant exemptions. And I don't think the Court wants to go down a road of having to count up how many agencies at the end of the day are discriminating on what basis.   As you yourself asked, what if there were just one agency? What if there were two or three or five? I think that's a really difficult area for the Court to have to get into. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, I -- I agree to that, but, arguably, the other -- the response to that might be we shouldn't be looking for problems before we confront them. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Fair -- fair enough, Justice Kavanaugh, but remember you don't even get to this set of questions because this is a government contracting case. And as the Court said in Nelson, you just ask whether the government's position here is reasonable.   And the government has two eminently reasonable interests it's seeking to vindicate here.   One is to treat all citizens equally when people are carrying out the government's own programs and not to balkanize its services. And, secondly, the government just has a managerial interest.   As I was just describing, if you have to start granting exemptions, all of a sudden running a program through the government gets very, very hard, even to the point where the City might just say, the heck with it, we're going to take this in-house and do it ourselves. And I don't think anybody disputes that the City could do that.   And once you've admitted the City could just do these certifications itself, it seems very odd to conclude that CSS is entitled to insist on own rules when it's carrying them out on the City's behalf. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Barrett. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Good morning, Mr. Fisher.   I have a question about something that some of the amicus briefs brought up, which is this third-party harm principle, the principle that religious beliefs can never give a believer the right to harm a third-party even slightly. I'm wondering if you agree with that and, if so, if you could tell me where in law the principle comes from. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Justice Barrett, I'm not sure that that's true as a categorical rule.   I think that, as some of the questions have pointed out this morning, when you get into situations like this, you need to balance the free exercise interests on the one hand against whatever the governmental interests are on the other at least in the abstract. So I think that, as I was just saying to Justice Kavanaugh, you don't get to a balance of the harms in this particular case because it's a government contracting case, and all you ask under Nelson is whether the government's rule is reasonable. But even if you did get to that and even if it were relevant whether there were third-party harms, as I was just describing, we would say there are serious governmental harms and there are also private harms.   We've talked about people being turned away in Philadelphia, and the amicus briefs tell you they're turned away elsewhere. But, remember, there's also a deterrent effect.   If people are aware that the government program allows discrimination, they may never enter the pool in the first place. There's no brochure that tells people, you know, this agency prefers people of this -- of your kind and these other agencies prefer people of the other kind.   And, frankly, if there were a brochure in that respect, it would just make it all the worse. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " I wanted to sneak in one -- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " So I think there are very harms here, Justice Barrett.   I wouldn't take the categorical view, though. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " I want to sneak in other question.   I think we would agree that there's really not any circumstance we can think of in which racial discrimination would be permitted as a religious exemption. Can you think of any example in which saying, as, you know, CSS has done here, that they, you know, will not certify same-sex couples, that -- where an objection to same-sex marriage would justify an exemption? Or is it like racial discrimination? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Well, Justice Barrett, I think, for purposes of your analysis here, it is like race discrimination.   I understand that race is special in many ways in the Court's jurisprudence.   But, as Justice Gorsuch stressed in Masterpiece Cakeshop, it is the proudest boast of free exercise jurisprudence that we do not judge the legitimacy or the offensiveness of religious beliefs if they are deeply felt, which, as we know from the Bob Jones case, for example, some religious organizations do have deeply felt views about interracial marriage. I think the Court would have to accept them.   Then the only question would be whether the compelling interest test applies differently in that scenario, and I don't think it would. As a matter of just compelling interest law, the Court has said not just that governments have an interest in eradicating race discrimination, but also, in Jaycees, the Court said sex discrimination, as we know from last term in Bostock, this could be thought of as sex discrimination.   And so I just don't think you could draw a line in this context between sexual orientation -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " A minute to wrap up, Mr. Fisher. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think I would just leave you with the -- with the last -- a couple of the last points I was making, which is I don't think anybody can dispute that if the City wanted to do this work itself, it could.   And so the any -- only question that you have is whether the analysis is any different because the City is operating through an independent contractor. And cases like Nelson and Lyng tell you the answer is no.   Also Rust v. Sullivan, a case we haven't yet discussed today, tells you the answer is no.   And so that just leaves the arguments the solicitor general is making about neutrality and the like. And I think the irreducible fact in that respect is that the City here would not allow race discrimination -- I'm sorry, would not allow this discrimination for any reason. The district court found this at page 85a to 88a.   I don't think anybody really thinks that this kind of activity would have been allowed in 2018 or going forward for any provider for any reason. And for that reason, we think that this is a case -- one way to think about this is a case about equal treatment versus special privileges.   The City has satisfied the equal treatment requirement, and it's not required to give special privileges here. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Three minutes for rebuttal, Ms. Windham. "}, {"speaker": "Lori H. Windham", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Three quick points. First, the discussion this morning has confirmed that Philadelphia does not have a neutral and generally applicable law.   They have waivers and exemptions.   They let agencies consider factors that are prohibited under the Fair Practices Ordinance, and they don't follow that ordinance themselves. Philadelphia now admits it's applying its public accommodations law, and the analysis would be different if the Court analyzed the use of sovereign authority under that law.   Even under Smith, that triggers strict scrutiny, and the City loses. Second, Respondents ignore the long history of Catholic Social Services doing the work it does today, partnering with foster parents to provide children with a family, walking with and supporting those families through a years-long and difficult process. This is the ministry that the City of Philadelphia is trying to extinguish.   The fact that CSS carries out other ministries and provides services at a loss, subsidizing the City, does not change the fact that the City is trying to extinguish this ministry. And it has done so in the most restrictive manner, sending the message that Sharonell Fulton must be excluded because she partners with an agency who shares her faith. Respondents urge the Court to decide some other case, not this case.   They claim all kinds of harms.   But religious foster agencies continue to serve in most states, and multiple states have even protected those agencies by law without negative results. Longstanding protections like RFRA's protect religious exercise and, yes, even government contractors.   Yet, Respondents cannot identify where their parade of horribles has come to pass. Finally, none of this was necessary. It all could have been avoided by a properly functioning Free Exercise Clause.   The courts are struggling to parse the exact contours of general applicability, while loving foster families remain excluded. The text, history, and traditions of the Free Exercise Clause teach that when the government wants to prohibit a longstanding religious exercise, it needs a compelling reason to do so.   That's a straightforward approach, and Philadelphia can't hope to pass it here. In our pluralistic society, this Court has repeatedly said that there should be room for those with different views.   But Smith's narrow view of the Free Exercise Clause stands in the way of that sensible result. Under Smith, particularly as applied by the courts below, government officials have no incentive to reach sensible accommodations, knowing they will be shielded by the flimsiest claim to have a generally applicable law. Our pluralistic society is at its best when it has a Free Exercise Clause that protects free exercise, not just of those who agree with the officials in charge. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
