[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Ysleta del Sur Pueblo versus Texas. Mr. Martin. "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question this case presents is whether the Restoration Act subjects the Pueblo to Texas's time, place, and manner restrictions as it relates to games that Texas does not flatly prohibit. It does not.   In the Restoration Act, Congress codified the Cabazon Band framework and specifically foreclosed Texas's regulatory authority over the tribe's gaming activities. The plain language of the Act provides us with clear support for this interpretation. On the heels of this Court's decision in Cabazon, Congress changed the language of the Restoration Act to replicate the prohibitory/ regulatory dichotomy struck in Cabazon.   Section 107(a) incorporates the Cabazon framework.   It federalizes Texas law but only as to prohibited games.   And bingo, in the State of Texas, is not a prohibited game. Section 107(b) clearly forecloses any interpretation of Section 107 in its entirety where Texas would have regulatory jurisdiction over tribal gaming.   And Section 107(b) must have meaning in the Act. The problem with the State of Texas's interpretation and the Fifth Circuit's interpretation in Ysleta I is that it reads 107(b) out of the Act entirely. This interpretation is also consistent with Congress's extension of the Cabazon framework to IGRA.   The two statutes are not in conflict, and you don't have to choose one over the other.   And even if that were the case, and we don't think it is, the plain language of the Restoration Act allows my client to engage in non-prohibited gaming activities. In Sections 107(a) and 107(b), Congress was sending the clear signal that it was incorporating the prohibitory/regulatory construct from Cabazon into a test applicable to these tribes.   The final text of the Restoration Act reflects the bargain that Congress struck. Each side got something but not everything. Texas was allowed to prevent prohibited games from being played by these tribes.   Meanwhile, the tribe was allowed to retain its sovereignty and its freedom from regulation as it related to gaming activities. And, with that, I'd be pleased to answer any questions from the Court. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Yes, counsel, the -- in the -- Cabazon was a grant of jurisdiction, right? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Is there any difference -- where -- is there a grant of jurisdiction in 107(a)? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Your Honor, looking at the text of 107(a), it's specifically dealing with the tribal gaming activities.   There's not a specific reference to the grant of the jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So what do -- just standing alone, what do you think it's doing? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Your Honor, I think it's dictating -- it's showing that Congress was extending the Cabazon framework to this fact pattern where Congress was federalizing state law as to prohibited gaming activities. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " It's taking the Public Law 280 structure that was explicated in Cabazon and extending it to this fact pattern. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So exactly how does it -- how is it doing that? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Your Honor, in the text itself, the first sentence: \"All gaming activities which are prohibited by the laws of the State of Texas are hereby prohibited on the reservation and on the lands of the tribes.\" "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " That seems almost as though it's adopting it as federal law. "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " It's adopting Texas's prohibitory laws as to prohibited gaming activities.   It's -- one of the things that's interesting, Your Honor, is that, compared to previous versions of this Act, this final -- one of the final changes in Section 108 was changing it from \"gaming\" and \"gambling\" and those broader terms to the concept of \"gaming activities\" and specifying prohibited gaming activities. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I mean, you say that 107 was enacted in light of Cabazon.   But it was directly enacted in light of the tribal resolution, which said that the tribe was willing at this point, after all the back and forth -- they obviously weren't happy about it, but they were willing to provide that all gaming, gambling, lottery, bingo shall be prohibited.   All, regardless of whether there's some that's permitted and some that's -- that's not according to the laws of -- of Texas. So, I mean, this is an odd case.   I haven't seen in decades briefs that were so full of legislative history and, you know, pre-enactment this or post-enactment that, but, I mean, if that's what we're going to -- if that's the game that's on, I mean, it looks to me like the tribal resolution had a much more direct connection to the legislation that was actually passed. "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Your Honor, if I may, I think the tribal resolution had a much more direct connection to previous versions of it. And I would agree with you there's a lot of legislative history in here, and some of it's legislative history and some of it is almost textual evolution on what was actually enacted. And one of the things that I would point out to Your Honor is the tribal resolution, which, again, was dated March 16th of 1986, that total ban or what the State of Texas calls the \"operative request\" -- and -- and that would have been a total ban.   There -- there's no way to deny that. However, that part of the text was incorporated into the Restoration Act into a version that never actually passed, and that was a version that was set forth in its -- this is in our brief on page 9, Your Honor -- that version was September 23rd of 1986.   Now that's interesting because Cabazon comes down and Cabazon is handed down on February 25th, 1987, so well after that version which reflected the tribal resolution was handed down.   After -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, do you think the law would have been passed without the tribal resolution, regardless of the particular form that it was enacted? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Your Honor, I think I'm focused on the law that was actually passed and the changes that were made by Congress.   I -- I don't know that I want to speculate on what would have happened or would not have happened. All I know is I have the text that -- we have the text that we have. And -- and the point that I was going to make was the final version of it is the one that -- no one here thinks that the final version in 107(a) is a total ban.   There's no way you can construct it to where it reflects a total ban. So it can't reflect what Texas calls the \"operative request.\" It has to mean something else.   And the final changes that were made to 107(a) talk about the prohibited gaming activities, and that's a different story than the prohibited gaming. And, Your Honor, if I may -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I don't know -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I was just going to say I don't know who you're including in everybody here, but it says prohibited.   And just -- I mean, if you had -- under Texas law, you can have bingo games sort of up to $100 at stake, okay, and then what -- what's happening is the tribe is having bingo games up to $1,000. Now, if you told somebody that, that they have games up to $1,000, it would be perfectly natural for that person to say, well, that's prohibited because there's a $100 cap. "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " And you would tell me that, no, you would say they would be able to, you know, gam- -- have the bingo games up to $1,000. "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Your Honor, those are the exact type of restrictions that this Court analyzed in Cabazon and determined to be regulatory.   And we believe that that's the exact same application that Congress was -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, suppose that that's right, Mr. Martin, but I think what the Chief Justice is suggesting is that it's not the normal term -- use of the term \"prohibited.\" What you're really relying on is the idea that Cabazon turns this language into a kind of term of art and that Congress was aware of that and that when Congress used the word \"prohibited\" it was incorporating this distinction that had been made in Cabazon.   And let's say that your argument really does depend on that.   It's not the normal use of the word \"prohibited.\" It's a Cabazon use of the word \"prohibited.\" So then the question is, what's your best evidence that this Court -- that the -- that Congress, when it passed this statute, really did have Cabazon in mind rather than was using the normal use of the word \"prohibited\"? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Your Honor, first of all, I -- I think that under Williams versus Taylor, we certainly can assume that Congress was taking language from one of this Court's opinions and incorporating it, especially in the exact same context of Indian gaming, and that they knew what it meant. The second aspect on how I would answer your question, Your Honor, is that under 107(a), we set up the prohibited structure and then, in 107(b), we set up the restriction on Texas's regulation.   And I think that that clearly evidences -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I don't really see 107(b) as doing that.   I mean, if I look at 107(b), it seems to me like much more of kind of the mirror image or flip side of 107(c) that says, you know, the federal courts have jurisdiction in -- in 107(c), and in 107(b), it says the state courts don't have jurisdiction. Why shouldn't -- so, on -- on that reading, 107(b) doesn't really help you, does it? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " I -- I think 107(b) helps us greatly, Your Honor, and I think that's the issue that we had with the Fifth Circuit's opinion. Regulatory jurisdiction within 107(b) is hearkening back to the -- the broader term of the state's inability to tax, regulate, license. It's the Bryan versus Itasca County test.   They don't have that regulatory authority. Whereas, in 107(c), in the title alone, it says jurisdiction over enforcement.   I don't think that you can combine -- and this is where I -- I respectfully disagree with -- with my friends from the State of Texas.   I don't think you can combine 107(b) to say that's enforcement.   I think that's confusing jurisdiction with the -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Could -- could we go back to the first way you answered the question? Because your first sentence was something like, you know, we presume that Congress knows about the law.   And, you know, sometimes we do, and then again, sometimes we don't. Do -- do you have a view of -- of -- of when we should make that presumption and why this case fits within that sphere? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " My view, Your Honor, would be that if Congress is using the exact same language, such as the use of the word \"prohibit,\" you can then dictate that, whether you call it a term of art or using the same term in the exact same context -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Counsel, \"prohibit,\" though, how many times does \"prohibit\" appear in the Code, and -- and, you know, one of the briefs counted how many times.   I mean, it's not a term of art in that sense, right? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " It is a term of art, Your Honor, when it's six months after Cabazon and you're talking about Indian gaming.   That -- that would be the distinction I would make. I believe that the cite that they gave you, and that was the State of Texas's brief, it talked about it appearing 8,800 times. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But what would they have -- if you were in Congress and you were aware of Cabazon and you wanted to use \"prohibited\" in the normal sense of the word and you said, well, I'm afraid that if I use this word \"prohibited,\" people are going to think it has the Cabazon meaning, what would you have -- how would you have written this? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I -- if I -- I would answer it by saying I think that we're talking just about \"prohibited\" and the use of the word \"prohibited.\" We also need to see what it modifies, which is prohibited gaming activities, because that was another change -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, maybe what -- "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " -- that affected Cabazon. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Martin", "text": " I -- Your Honor, my submission would be that by using the word \"prohibited\" in 107(a) and then using no regulatory jurisdiction in 107(b), that it was clear that they were intending to implicate Cabazon.

There seems to be a dispute whether this type of bingo by machine is the same as the bingo we know, people in a room calling out numbers. You dispute that.   You say it's the same.   But assuming that there's -- and I do -- that there's a genuine dispute on that issue, that still would be subject to federal jurisdiction, a court would then decide below whether this type of slot machine is actually bingo, correct?

But, if Texas continued -- if this Court remands it back down to the trial court for a finding, Texas brought -- continued its action under 107(c) for an injunction, the federal trial court would determine whether or not it was a prohibited gaming activity under Section 107(a). And I'm trying to be very careful and precise with my words here.   Whether or not that's bingo, whether or not that's not bingo, I think that there's a number of factors that would factor into the consideration by the trial court, but that would be under the federal court's jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Martin, could I take you back to Justice Gorsuch's question about IGRA? If -- if you prevail, the tribe is regulated under IGRA.

The third sentence of 107(c), it -- it has a very interesting construction.   It's not -- you can't read it as an affirmative grant of an injunctive relief. It says \"nothing herein shall preclude the State of Texas from bringing an injunction,\" almost suggesting that there -- if there was a preexisting right from the State of Texas to have that injunction, that they would still have it.   I'm not opining on that, but I'm saying that that would still exist. And to the extent that it was read as an affirmative grant or an additional remedy, that the State of Texas would still have that under the Restoration Act. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I guess what I was asking about is it would still be true that Texas -- or is this wrong -- that -- that -- that the -- that when 107(c) gives jurisdiction to the federal courts, is that different from the scheme that prevails in IGRA?

You're talking about sovereign tribes and Congress being the only one that has the plenary power to decide certain aspects of it. If you remember in Cabazon, it talked about the fact that Congress made the decision to help -- have the tribes do this in terms of their self-sufficiency. So I think the sovereignty aspect of it shouldn't be and can't be overlooked because that's where 107(b) comes in.   That's where the resolution is answered, right? The tribe was willing to give up a certain amount of gaming activities in order to not have Texas state law apply directly and not be subject to its resolu- -- regulation.   Congress ultimately decided not to accept their offer and to give them less restrictions than they could have in response to Cabazon. So I think all of those fits as a piece, and it is also why, you know, you could talk about the -- the opioid hypothetical, you could talk about other hypotheticals along those same lines, but this concept of the sovereignty and the tribe's ability to engage in gaming activities I do think is a different story. It's not just here's Cabazon, live with it, right? As you put it, Your Honor, and much more succinctly than I have in a month of prepping for this, it's not just that.   It's more there are questions of the sovereignty aspects of it and the regulatory aspects of it, the Public Law 280 aspects of it that I think Congress was answering when it wrote the Restoration Act in response to Cabazon.

Section 107(a) forbids a tribe from engaging in gaming activities that are prohibited under Texas law, and Section 107(b) further provides that Section 107(a) does not grant the state civil or criminal regulatory jurisdiction. Texas has conceded in this Court that Section 107(b) restates the limits of Public Law 280.   Those limits draw directly from Cabazon, they limit state regulatory jurisdiction, and they make clear that Section 107 adopts the Cabazon framework.

This is exactly the distinction that Congress -- that this Court in Cabazon drew.

You need to preserve tribal sovereignty and tribal government and that if you allow state regulatory power on tribal lands, you would destroy tribal sovereignty.   That principle in Bryan was extended in Cabazon specifically to the gaming context, where the Court drew this prohibitory/regulatory distinction. We don't think this is a problem with respect to all of 18 U.S. Code -- C because, when you're interpreting a -- a statute like this, particularly a statute enacted directly on the heels of a Supreme Court decision on the same subject matter using the same language, what you look to is not some general understanding of the word \"prohibit;\" you look to the way that this Court has used the term \"prohibit.\" "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Yang, just to follow up on the Chief Justice's point, I -- I -- I take your argument that this is a unique context and -- and we have to read the language in that context.

Two, you cover those numbers when they are drawn or somehow identified.   And you win by covering an arrangement of numbers. This is in 2703(7)(A)(i).   This is a kind of understanding of what bingo is.   And you would ask, is this bingo, or is it a method of conducting bingo when you use a computer? Even Texas, by the way, allows card mining devices, which are these devices where you can, instead of tracking five cards, you can track up to 66 cards under state law at one time.   The problem that the district court found was not that this wasn't bingo; it was that Texas law requires that you not submit -- put the money in the device or get paid out by the device.   That was the problem under Texas law. There's a legitimate question whether this would be Class II or Class III bingo under IGRA, but, you know, that's not presented here. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

"}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " You know, I think it would depend on how the Court wrote the opinion.   This is a Texas-specific statute, so it might be possible. But I would -- you know, so there are some questions that I'd like to still address. One was about the meaning of 20 -- 107(b).   I think 107(b) has to be read in conjunction with 105(f).   105(f) is a grant of civil and criminal jurisdiction to the state under Public Law 280. When they use jurisdiction there, Justice Kagan, it's not with respect to courts. It's with respect to authority, and the use of that term is generally used -- you know, post-Arbaugh we're trying to get away from using jurisdiction when we don't mean court jurisdiction, but this is before Arbaugh and it's quite common both in legislation and in the Court's decisions. Then, if you look at 107(b), it uses that same phrase \"civil and criminal jurisdiction\" but inserts \"regulatory.\" And that was the exact distinction that Cabazon drew. Remember Cabazon was already writing on top of Bryan, which said there's no crim- -- civil regulatory jurisdiction, and it said just because you add a criminal sanction doesn't convert it to a criminal law that you can enforce under Public Law 280.   107(b) directly draws on that same Cabazon distinction, and it says nothing in Section 107 shall be interpreted to grant that authority, which means 107(a), when it says gaming activities prohibited by state law, does not grant regulatory authority, and that is the second half of the Cabazon framework, prohibited, not regulated. The -- I think also, you know, IGRA is worth considering here because Congress enacted IGRA, same Congress, and as the Court -- Justice Scalia explained in Branch versus Smith, when you have a similar statute and the same body of law, you can look at that to clarify the meaning of another statute because it's within the same body of law.   You read it in pari materia. And I don't think there's really any dispute that by using the same regulated and prohibit language and the provisions that we've talked about, which are at page 9 of our brief, that Congress in IGRA was adopting Cabazon, Congress was doing the same thing here.

The text of the statute cannot be read as applying the -- the final request in the resolution because no one thinks and the text does not allow you to read 107(a) to prohibit all gaming prohibited under Texas law.   It's just not what happened. There was also a significant textual change.   When Congress first adopted the reference to the tribal resolution, it said pursuant to the tribal resolution -- this is on page 4 of our brief -- all gaming is prohibited if it's as defined under Texas law.   Cabazon came, Congress retooled 107, and then it said -- instead of said pursuant to the resolution, it said this is enacted in accordance with the resolution.   We think that has some more flexibility, and what it really reflects primarily is the tribe's strong opposition to the direct application of state law.   That's why Section 107 is federal law, and that's why federal enforcement generally prevails, with the exception of state enforcement, if the state has a preexisting cause of action that it can assert for an injunction against a tribal officer.

But Justice Alito raised what to me is an interesting question that I've been thinking about a good deal about what these substantive canons of interpretation are and when they exist and when they don't exist. They're all over the place, of course. It's not just the Indian canon.   Next week, we're going to be thinking about the supposed major questions canon.   There are other canons. I mean, if you go through Justice Scalia's book, you'll find a wealth of canons of this kind, these sort of substantive canons. Some of them help the government.   Some of them hurt the government. Is there any way that the government has of coming in and saying, like, how do we reconcile our views of all these different kinds of canons? Maybe we should just toss them all out, you know.

"}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " Well, I think our briefs generally grapple first with the text, right, as we've done here.   And canons, I think, can play an important role in certain contexts.   I think, for instance, Bryan recognized that in the Indian tribal sovereignty context, there is a very important principle that kind of underlays the body of the law there. You do not want to read statutes to grant state regulatory authority on tribal lands without kind of a clear expression of that.   And I think that those types of principles reflect a background body of law that one brings when reading statutes. So it's true, you know, I think I've seen the Court's decision that, you know, sometimes you get canons that conflict, right, that run in contrary directions.   These are aids in interpretation, but we always start with the text. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Gorsuch?

In the specific context when you're talking about the application of -- of state regulatory authority in -- on Indian lands, you know, you need to be more cautious. Now, admittedly, this is a federal statute that implied -- that applies federal law, but I think some of the caution that Bryan reflects, I think, should -- should guide the Court.

Pettit", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the 1980s, everybody in this case wanted something.   The tribe wanted federal recognition and was willing to cede some of its sovereignty.   Texas wanted to avoid high-stakes gambling, which it saw as an invitation to organized crime, and was willing to cede some of its jurisdiction. The federal government was split about how to balance these sovereign interests.   So every -- so everyone made concessions, which are embodied in the Restoration Act.   The tribe got its recognition and may offer gambling to the same extent as other Texans, but further gambling is banned under federal law. The tribe asks to rewrite this legislative bargain based on Cabazon Band, but it's admitted that Cabazon Band did not address how to interpret a statute that federalizes state law.   Its effort to extend Cabazon Band suffers from three primary faults. First, it ignores that when it comes to gambling, the Restoration Act departs from the Cabazon Band framework by treating both civil and criminal penalties and civil and criminal regulatory jurisdiction the same way. Second, it overlooks that the Cabazon Band test was written to avoid a form of state encroachment into tribal affairs that isn't possible when a federal court is applying federal law. And, third, it depends on a definition of jurisdiction that disregards the close tie between that term in the 1980s and an adjudicator's ability to decide a case.   That's how it's used in Public Law 280, in Section 105(f), and, as Justice Kagan noted, in Section 107(c). Applying that same definition to 107(b), regulatory jurisdiction encompasses a state administrative agency's ability to exercise oversight through, among other things, reporting requirements, inspections, and ultimately enforcement actions, not the state's larger ability to set substantive limits on gambling. I welcome this Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Counsel, could you give me an example of a regulatory law or rule that applies -- a gaming -- a regulation of gaming laws that applies to tribes that do not fall under 107(a)? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " I'm not -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I'm sorry, that would be covered -- would not count as a prohibition under 107(a)? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " To the extent -- so 107 -- prohibition, as it's generally understood, means it's unlawful.   There is -- a regulation that would apply to somebody who's not the tribe that wouldn't be a prohibition would, for example, be that the Texas Lottery Commission can typically get access to passwords so that people -- they can -- would have an ongoing oversight into the way that software functions. That's a regulation that wouldn't apply to the tribe because it's not a prohibition relating to gaming activity. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Now we -- there's been some discussion as to the -- the difference between prohibition and regulation. Would you comment on that? I mean, you've heard all the arguments. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So prohibition in this context and as generally understood can include a regulation except for, as Justice Barrett noted a couple of times, Cabazon Band. So the regulation distinction made in Cabazon Band was specific to Public Law 280, which was trying to decide the difference between criminal and civil laws, which is a question not presented by the Restoration Act. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So there seems to be by counsel a suggestion that the mere fact that any group could participate in bingo, for example, the veterans organization or the churches, that even if it's outlawed, as to other organizations or for profit, that that is not a prohibition. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Under their view, that's my understanding.   But it's still a prohibition under Texas law because it goes to a fundamental problem with the public policy shorthand for the criminal/civil jurisdiction distinction that Cabazon Band was trying to make because, as Justice Alito pointed out, a -- a prohibition is still a matter of public policy, even if it includes exceptions when it's not -- when the activity is not prohibited. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry, counsel.   Could you explain that more clearly to me? Just earlier you said to Justice Thomas that a regulation that wouldn't apply to the Indians would be one that required their passwords to play the game, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And I assume that's because you recognize that the prohibition is on -- on playing bingo, not on how you play bingo, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " On the gaming activity, yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So how is that different than what you just said? Meaning -- "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- a financial requirement, the password requirement, I don't know how you can read that into gaming activities which are prohibited by, because bingo's not prohibited by.   What does it matter whether it's a not-for-profit or not? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So the bingo outside of the limited affirmative jurisdiction -- sorry. The offense to prosecution is what the Bingo Enabling Act is.   So any bingo that is not -- that is not conducted pursuant to the Bingo Enabling Act is prohibited as a matter of Texas criminal law. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You can't play bingo unless you give the password? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " No, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You can't play bingo unless you meet certain financial requirements.   You can't play bingo because you're not a not-for-profit. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " No, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I don't know where I draw those lines. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So the password example that I gave was a regulation applicable to the bingo -- to the -- in the larger bingo regulatory framework of Texas law that does not apply to the tribe because it doesn't go to the gaming activity.   The gaming activity could for -- to take the Chief Justice's example, be a distinction between low-stakes bingo under $100 or the distinction in Texas of over 750. The state's regulatory interests or the state's prohibitory interests, however you want to frame it, is different between low-stakes and high-stakes gambling. So the use of the term \"law\" is another -- is another focus under 107(a), and both the tribe and the United States focused on a earlier version of the bill that ultimately became the statute that included the terms \"laws\" and \"regulations.\" But, under this Court's precedent, the term \"laws\" typically includes regulations, so you can't really interpret anything by the deletion of redundant language in a draft bill. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Counsel, what about the other laws that were passed contemporaneously with this one for other tribes that used broader language like \"prohibit\" or \"regulate\"? Why shouldn't we look at the contrast between this more precise or narrower language and those? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " By looking at the context of each of the statutes, each of the statutes they cite is a settlement act that is enabling a preexisting agreement between the parties to litigation. So those -- the language that Your Honor is citing is maybe the language that the parties determined was necessary, but it doesn't give much of an indication, if any, about what Congress would have determined was necessary if it was on its own. And this also goes to the larger context of the Restoration Act because the term \"prohibit\" and the term \"regulate\" were in the Restoration Act before Cabazon Band. After Cabazon Band, in the Senate, there was two -- there were two distinct changes to both 107(a) and 107(b) that show a departure from Cabazon Band which expressly linked the concept of civil and regulatory and criminal and prohibitory, that is, the insertion of civil and criminal penalties in respect to prohibitions in 107(a) and the phrase -- and the insertion of \"and criminal\" into a preexisting statute that said civil regulatory jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So, if I -- I take it the difference is you think the words \"prohibit\" -- \"prohibited by the laws\" refers to all the prohibitions by the criminal laws.   And they think it refers to the -- there is a distinction between regulatory and prohibiting it outright. Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And the whole key here is are they referring to Cabazon, as they think, or are they thinking back to -- back to the resolution, where they said we don't even want Texas.   You know, that's the big difference. And everybody is looking at different other statutes which may or may not cast some light.   Okay.   I think I know the answer, but, look, I'm in an odd position.   I'm like the light brigade.   I have cannons to the left of me and cannons to the right of me, and I'm going into the valley of death, charged the 400, but, I mean, there used to be ways of finding these things out. You went and you read the report of the Senate committee or the House committee or the conference committee, and you read the testimony before the committees, and you read what the Justice Department told them or the Department of the Interior, and you read what other people said on the floor perhaps, and sometimes but not always that, in fact, shed some light on the proper answer. So my question is, if, pursuing my odd single path perhaps, I did that here, would I find anything? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " You would find the Senate report, which is the only report that deals with the final version of the statute, and the Senate report said that the addition of civil and criminal penalties, what I just mentioned, was designed to build upon what the House was making -- what the House had originally amended to say just prohibit to make clear that civil penalties were also applicable, which we respectfully suggest supports our cause. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I pressed your friend, Mr. Martin, a little bit on the tribal resolution, which I think is very strong evidence for you.   On the other hand, his answer that, well, that wasn't addressed in the final bill, it was a predecessor bill, also seemed pretty good. Do you have an answer to that? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Your Honor, the resolution may have been passed in response to the -- to a prior bill, but it is incorporated into the text or it's at least referenced in the text of the actual bill that was passed and became law, so that has to be given some meaning.   And the fact that it was aimed at a different bill is not dispositive one way or the other. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Ms. Pettit, if -- if, you know, this just said \"prohibit\" and we were in a world where we didn't have any context on the page or otherwise, I think you would win. The question is, do we have so much context about \"prohibit\" being used in a specialized way that you lose? And I -- I guess I would just point you to a few things and ask you to address them one by one. So the first is 105(f), which I take it you acknowledge incorporates Public Law 280, and Public Law 280 had just been interpreted in Cabazon as having this prohibitory/regulatory distinction. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The second is 107(b), which specifically talks about criminal regulatory jurisdiction.   Now there's a question as to what kinds of -- what kind of jurisdiction it's talking about here because jurisdiction is used in two different senses in this statute, but I think that Mr. Yang has an awfully good argument that when they're talking about regulatory jurisdiction, they're not talking about it in the which court sense, they're talking about it in the Cabazon sense. So -- so it says, you know, we don't want to give the state regulatory jurisdiction, meaning the state doesn't have any regulatory power here. Then the third thing would be what Justice Barrett said, I think you've responded to that, the other statutes passed around the same time, actually, on the same day, right, that clearly understand the Cabazon prohibitory/regulatory distinction. So you take all of those together, and this is what I meant when I said to Mr. Yang Cabazon is, like, written all over this statute. It's not just like we have a world in which we say: Oh, didn't they know about Cabazon? Would that have affected what they were doing? I mean, Cabazon is in this statute in multiple places.   So why isn't it in this statute in a way that defeats your claim here? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So, in Cabazon, this Court used the phrase \"regulatory authority,\" not \"regulatory jurisdiction.\" When referring to the power to set laws, this Court has typically used the term \"legislative jurisdiction,\" which is tellingly not the word that Congress had selected. Moreover, the -- and I would point -- he made a comment post-Arbaugh that you try to be more careful about jurisdiction.   I think that in the 1980s there was a very clear tie between jurisdiction and an adjudicative officer, not necessarily a court.   And I would point you to the Fifth Edition of Black's Law Dictionary, which was published in about 1983, which specifically discusses jurisdiction in those terms. So it may not be a court-specific term, but absent the phrase \"legislative jurisdiction,\" it does tend to have an adjudicative meaning.   So that is where -- and it's used consistently in 105(f), which Your Honor referenced, in that -- in that sense.   And it's used in 107(c) in that sense.   And so it would make sense to use it in 107(b) in that sense to avoid the charge of the light brigade with various cannons. So, in that -- in reading it in the larger context of how that term was used in the '80s, as opposed to, for example, in the mid-2000s, after this Court's case of City of Arlington against FCC, where you equated authority and jurisdiction, helps to clarify any ambiguities. So that's all I have.   I'm happy to answer any -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Given -- given Cabazon -- sorry to interrupt.   Given Cabazon, why wouldn't it have been obvious to members of Congress to say something like the following if you wanted to do this, like \"all Texas law regulating gaming activities applies to gaming activities on the reservation and lands of the tribe\"? Why -- "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " I mean, in other words, boy, there's this case, we better be careful.   And we're in the world where we're assuming Congress is responding to the case. So why wouldn't the people who wanted this broader authority to extend have been -- we need to -- we need to be careful about this and doesn't the -- then the absence of that suggest something that -- that hurts your case here? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Two responses. First, I heard a lot from both the United States and from the tribe that said that Cabazon Band was -- was especially informative because of the context.   But Cabazon Band addressed -- may have the facts of Cabazon Band, may have been relating to gambling, but it addressed a statute that applied across the board equally to Texas and to regulation of pharmaceuticals or a number of the other hypotheticals we've had today. So why Congress would have necessarily said: Well, Cabazon Band defines exactly what term we have for gambling, it -- it's not nearly as close as that. And I believe Justice Alito asked a few minutes ago how you determine whether you are going to apply a canon about assuming Congress -- or it might have been Justice Kagan -- I apologize -- about when you assume Congress was understanding the particular context. Normally, this Court does that when you have a well-established term that's been used a number of times, whereas, here, you have just the term \"prohibit,\" which is a commonly used statutory term, it's been interpreted once in a case that respectfully is not the most precise case this course -- Court has ever issued.   And so assuming that Congress enter -- intended to enact and make permanent for all tribes for all uses of \"prohibit\" based on this one case would be taking that canon too far. And the best way I think I can point this to is differences between the language of IGRA, which, for example, does track Cabazon Band in that it says prohibits as a matter of criminal law or public policy in 2701(5). That's not the phrase that we have in -- in the Restoration Act.   That is -- what we have simply is the use of the common term \"prohibit.\" You see that again in 2710 when you're talking about when -- when Congress is talking about when the state can or the tribe can engage in activity which is whether the state prohibit -- permits it for any purpose, for any person, entity, or organization. Again, that tracks the Cabazon Band prohibition -- prohibition language much more closely than here, where we just have that term \"prohibit.\" "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Was -- wasn't it obvious or wouldn't it have been obvious that what happens when a state allows an activity but regulates it heavily, can those regulations apply to the tribes? Wasn't that an obvious question and wouldn't that have been addressed in a different way, I guess, again, if we're in this world where we're trying to speculate what Congress was thinking? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " This is why it's always dangerous to speculate what Congress was thinking. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yeah, that's a good answer. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " But laws -- laws typically does include -- does -- do -- the term \"laws\" typically does include regulations, unless Congress specifies otherwise, which it didn't do here. And this goes back to a number of the questions we've had today about the signage that is at -- at casinos and whether that would apply to the tribe.   And it doesn't because it doesn't go to the gaming activity as this Court defined that in Bay Mills, where it was the -- the -- I think the words of the Court were the throw of the dice or the turn of the wheel, the actual game that's being played and not the offsite administrative or regulatory body, so -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But, Ms. Pettit, why would it make sense? You know, here, in 107(c), the federal court is given jurisdiction if the state wants to bring an action for an injunction to stop, in your view, regulatory violations on the gaming activity. Why would it make sense to enlist federal district courts to police all these aspects of gaming? It -- it just seems to me like that would be an odd system. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So the -- we are only entitled to bring a -- an injunctive action for violations of the substantive limitations on gambling, not the regulations that don't go to the gaming activities, but it does make sense because, as the United States pointed out, the tribe was very against the direct application of state laws in state courts, which was the issue in Cabazon Band. So there isn't the direct application of state law here.   There's this third party, a federal judge that is a -- neutral might be a loaded term for this context, but I'll use it anyway -- a neutral arbiter to apply the issue rather than having to, for example, go into the state's home court. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But it's a huge -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Let me clarify.   I think I misspoke.   I didn't mean -- I mean, I know that you concede that you don't have regulatory jurisdiction in the sense of an agency oversight and all these other aspects, but I'm talking about the disputed number of things, once bingo is allowed, is it, you know, allowed by non-charitable organizations? Is it allowed for profit? Is it allowed above this amount, those kinds of things? I mean, the district courts in Texas have complained about all of these things heading to the district court. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So the district courts have said that a version of the -- a previous injunction issued in 2002 had turned them into a sort of pre-clearance type of regime that hadn't been contemplated by the Restoration Act.   We agree that wasn't contemplated by the Restoration Act, but it was necessitated by the tribe's actions, who had not attempted to comply with the Restoration Act. But, fortunately, we're no longer in that regime.   We have brought a separate complaint, and most of the issues that are covered in the current injunction before the Court are statutory ones, not regulations. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   But your position requires you to accept the idea that, for example, if Texas has a statute that says bingo has to end at 1 a.m. and instead it goes to 1:10, that all of a sudden that's a federal crime adjudicable in federal court. I mean, that's your position.   It's not -- you know, the other person -- side's position is essentially no, the federal courts are there when Texas has a statute that says no table games, and all of a sudden a casino opens up with craps, but your position is like everything, you know, the -- the -- the -- the amount of the betting, the hours, the -- the -- the -- I mean, everything that relates to the turn of the wheel or whatever, and that's a lot of stuff. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " But it does create a blight -- a bright-line rule, Your Honor, which gets the federal court out of the second question that would be necessitated by applying Cabazon Band, namely whether one particular restriction or another is a matter of fundamental state public policy, and there are law and order concerns that sometimes drive issues like closing down gambling halls at midnight or limiting the amount of money that is at stake because there is a -- there -- it's a different regulatory and a different public policy and a different just risk involved in some term -- in some forms of gaming.

Are you asking us to overturn Cabazon? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C.

So -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Wouldn't that logic seem to suggest, if that's true, then -- then -- then Cabazon, we should just get rid of it and scrap it and -- and the consequences for IGRA be damned? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So the consequences for IGRA, I respectfully disagree with the United States, would not be significant because IGRA incorporated the pieces of Cabazon Band that it thought were necessary in the language that I previously quoted.   But the Court doesn't need to revoke the or repeal -- overturn the Cabazon Band distinction for the -- for the circumstances to which it applies.

But just this is the one area where we're not going to apply Cabazon? That's -- that's your view? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C.

Mr. Yang said, look, this has been humming along, everybody's been living with Cabazon Band and this distinction between \"prohibit\" and \"regulate\" in Public Law 280 and in IGRA.   So why is it so uniquely unworkable in this context? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So the lower courts have suggested that Mr. Yang is incorrect on that point, that, in fact, it's difficult to derive a single rule between what is prohibitory and what is regulatory precisely because many of the things that are nominally prohibitory are very close -- very close concerns of state public policy, so they just don't track.   And to -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, isn't that an argument for overturning it in IGRA too and just getting rid of it? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So IGRA incorporated a specific part of Cabazon Band that allows the tribe in 2710 to engage in Class II gaming, which permits them to -- if the state permits it under any person, any purpose, any organization. So that is a different term than prohibitory or regulatory and trying to combine -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I understand that. But -- but -- but if -- you're -- you're -- you're saying it doesn't work well under IGRA. You're disputing Mr. Yang on that. "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " So I'm -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But you're saying this is somehow unique, and I guess I'm struggling, like -- like -- like my colleague, to understand how -- how it's uniquely problematic here but -- but less problematic, I guess, under IGRA? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Maybe I misspoke earlier. IGRA -- the Public Law 280 prohibitory/ regulatory distinction itself is problematic outside of IGRA because it doesn't have that any purpose, any person, any language.   That creates a bright-line rule, whereas this Court recognized in Cabazon Band itself that the distinction based on what is or is not a matter of fundamental state public policy does not create a blight -- bright-line rule.

Pettit", "text": " Texas doesn't have that much experience under IGRA, so I'm not able to answer that question. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It has some experience.   It has the Kickapoo Tribe that's operating under Class II gaming pursuant to IGRA.   So, right now, what you have is one tribe under IGRA, another tribe completely out of IGRA, and even worse, you're saying it wasn't even intended to be run like the regulatory prohibition line that Cabazon approved, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Correct.

That, and the Kickapoo -- the -- my response earlier was that we do not regulate the Kickapoo, so we do not have much insight into what they're doing inside their casino, so it's very difficult for me to say whether it's been a problem.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Suppose you scrapped your laws about bingo and you enacted a statute that says that under specified circumstances, a type of gambling called Texas Traditional Board Game is allowed, and you defined that involving a board and et cetera, et cetera.

Pettit", "text": " If we scrapped the Texas Bingo Enabling Act, it would fall within the constitutional prohibitions on lottery and it would be prohibited.   It's still prohibited outside the Bingo Enabling Act, but it would be flatly prohibited under state law. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And it may be useful to answer your question to distinguish this from the facts in California's instance in Cabazon Band, where they generally permitted gambling except that which we prohibited. Texas has the exact opposite presumption.   We have a strong public policy and all gambling is banned under the constitution unless specifically authorized.   The Bingo Enabling Act specifically authorizes small-stakes bingo under very limited circumstances as a defense to prosecution. But, if -- if we were to scrap that Bingo Enabling Act, it would -- the contact -- the conduct of the tribe in this instance would fall within the state's constitutional ban on lotteries.

If you lost and we vacated and remanded and so then the district court has to face the question of whether these electronic bingo games count as bingo, you just revert to the Texas definition and I gather it's Texas's position that these electronic machines would not count as bingo? "}, {"speaker": "Lanora C. Pettit", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, because they are slot machines.   They -- they do not have the competitive aspect of bingo because what -- I believe somebody referred to their grandmother earlier, that is a -- you are matching numbers and the first person to reach a particular pattern wins.   And, here, you have one card and it is an instant game that is drawn against a historic -- a historic bingo draw, and that's just not bingo.

It's the same issue under IGRA, which is why the United States was very careful to say that the question of whether or not this is actually bingo under IGRA is a very close one. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martin, rebuttal? "}, {"speaker": "Brant C. Martin", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.   Four quick points. First of all, in response to a question from the bench, I -- I think that the Justices -- you certainly understand the distinction and the difficulty that the State of Texas has with making the distinction as to where the regulatory line starts and where the regulatory line stops. If they wanted the passwords, they had to get the passwords.   When is that not regulation and when is it if they can, in fact, regulate? And the problem is is that their position requires them to take the position that the entirety of the regulatory construct of Texas law, and this is the same thing the Fifth Circuit said in Ysleta I, is that the entirety of the regulatory construct applies to the tribes.   That's not what 107(b) says. And in response to some of the jurisdictional questions, Section 105(f) grants civil and criminal jurisdiction to grant the Public Law 280 authority.   Jurisdiction there means the substantive authority; it's not limited to court jurisdiction. Section 107(b)'s use of the jurisdiction is the same.   Section 107(c) is different, and it specifically says jurisdiction over enforcement. And there was one other aspect of -- of what the State of Texas has -- has argued just now in this case that I think is -- deserves to be said.   There's been a lot of discussion about whether or not Cabazon applies, you know, are we stuck in the Cabazon context, et cetera. Two things I would point out.   Justice Breyer, I would point out that Representative Udall, who was the chairman of the applicable subcommittee, stated on the House floor this is intended to incorporate Cabazon. That's important.   The Senate report that was cited by the State of Texas references the old language that Congress excised, and that should be taken into account. Finally, Your Honor, I would point out I can't remember exactly how the State of Texas just put it, but they were talking about Section 107 and they said that it applies to everything, not just gaming.   Section 107 is entitled \"Indian Gaming.\" It is entitled -- it is intended to govern that exact situation in response to Cabazon. And if there's no further questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
