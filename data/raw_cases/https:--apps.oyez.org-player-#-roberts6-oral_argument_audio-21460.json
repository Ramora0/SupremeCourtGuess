[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case 12-307, United States v. Windsor, and we will begin with the jurisdictional discussion.   Ms. Jackson? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is no justiciable case before this Court.   Petitioner, the United States, does not ask this Court to redress the injuries it asserts.   The House of Representatives' Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, the BLAG, which does seek redress in the form of reversal, asserts no judicially cognizable injury.   While it is natural to want to reach the merits of such a significant issue, as in Raines v.--   Byrd, this natural urge must be put aside because, however important the constitutional question, Article III prevents its decision here and requires this Court to await another case, another day, to decide the question.   In the district court, Ms. Windsor alleged classical Article III injury for which she sought redress.   Other persons injured by DOMA's operation could likewise sue in a first instance court and, if their challenge succeeds, obtain relief.   But to exercise jurisdiction on this appeal when the United States asked for the judgment below, fully agrees with it, and-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Who else is going to be aggrieved if she is not?

In addition, the issue of DOMA-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me.   If there is no jurisdiction here, why was there jurisdiction at the trial level? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C.

If you have a, let's say, a lawsuit on an -- on an indebtedness and the alleged debtor comes in and says, yeah, I owe them money, but I'm just not gonna pay it, which is the equivalent of the Government saying, yeah, it's unconstitutional but I'm going to enforce it anyway.   What would happen in that -- in that indebtedness suit is that the court would enter judgment and say, if you agree that you owe it, by God, you should pay it.   And there would be a judgment right there without any consideration of the merits, right?   Why didn't that happen here? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " --Your Honor, the -- the two questions that you asked me, why did the district court have jurisdiction, the first answer is that the party invoking the district court's jurisdiction was Ms.--   Windsor, who did have an injury.   As to why the district court didn't enter judgment when the United States switched its position, I -- I imagine that the Court was -- would have wanted to have development of that issue, which was achieved through the intervention of the BLAG in the trial court, so that the judgment of unconstitutionality and of refund would have had a robust hearing-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Really, that's very peculiar.   When -- when both parties to the case agree on what the law is?   What, the -- just for fun, the district judge is -- is going to have a hearing? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C.

In Kentucky-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I'm not talking about jurisdiction now.   I'm talking about why the district court, without getting to the merits, should not have entered judgment against the Government. "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " --I am not sure I have a wonderful answer to that question, Justice Scalia, but I do think the case bears some similarities to Kentucky against Indiana, which was discussed by the parties, where Kentucky sued Indiana in this Court's original jurisdiction on a contract.   The two States had a contract.   Indiana agreed it was obligated to perform, but it wasn't performing.   There -- it was worried about a State court lawsuit.   This Court exercised original jurisdiction to give Kentucky relief.   And I think that's analogous to what the district court did there.   The issue before us today, I think, is an issue of appellate jurisdiction.   And the U.S. is seeking to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of Article III courts, notwithstanding that it doesn't seek relief; it seeks affirmance. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, the Solicitor General's standing argument is very abstract.   But here is one possible way of understanding it, perhaps the Solicitor General will disavow it, but it would go like this: The President's position in this case is that he is going to continue to enforce DOMA, engage in conduct that he believes is unconstitutional, until this Court tells him to stop.   The judgment of the Second Circuit told the Executive Branch to comply with the Equal Protection Clause immediately.   The President disagrees with the temporal aspect of that, so the Executive is aggrieved in the sense that the Executive is ordered to do something prior to the point when the Executive believes it should do that thing.   Now, wouldn't that be sufficient to make -- to create injury in the Executive and render the Executive an aggrieved party? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " I think not, Your Honor.   I think not, because I don't see how that would be any different from any party saying, well, we really don't want to pay this judgment until we're sure all of the courts agree.   And I think this Court's -- this Court doesn't have a lot of case law where a party seeks review to get affirmance.   But in the Princeton University against Schmidt case, there was a State court conviction, Ohio State Court overturns it, Princeton University seeks review, because its regulations were at issue.   New Jersey joins in seeking review, but does not ask for relief; does not take a position on what relief would be appropriate. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why -- why wouldn't -- imagine -- there in Article II, it says that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.   So the President has worked out -- I, personally, and for reasons in -- in my department, others think that this law is unconstitutional, but I have this obligation.   And because I have this obligation, I will not, I will continue to execute this law.   I will continue to execute it though I disagree with it.   And I execute it until I have an authoritative determination not to.   Now, how is that different from a trustee who believes that he has an obligation to a trust to do something under a certain provision that he thinks doesn't require that, but, you know, there's a debate about it, but he says, I have the obligation here.   I'm going to follow this through.   There'd be standing in the second case for any fiduciary, despite his personal beliefs, to continue.   We'd understand that and say there was standing.   Why don't we here? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " Well, the trustee, I think, would be able to go to a court of first instance to get an adjudication of the claim.   What I'm submitting to you that the trustee could not do, after getting the first -- the judgment in the court of first instance stating what the remedy -- what the liability is, then seek review of that judgment, but ask only for it to be affirmed. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And that's the part I don't understand.   For -- if, in fact, as you agree, the trustee or other fiduciary in my example would indeed have standing to act according to the law, even though he thinks that that law is unconstitutional because of his obligation such as under Section 2.   You agree he has the -- he has -- there is standing when he goes into court in the first place, which surely he could interpret Article II as saying and you follow it through as long as you can do it, which includes appeals, until the matter is determined finally and authoritatively by a court.   If you could do the first, what suddenly stops you from doing the second? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " In the first instance, the obligations are uncertain the trustee is presumably subject to potentially adverse competing claims on his or her action. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I would have thought-- "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " Those are-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --I would have thought your answer would be that the Executive's obligation to execute the law includes the obligation to execute the law consistent with the Constitution.   And if he has made a determination that executing the law by enforcing the terms is unconstitutional, I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute, but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution, rather than saying, oh, we'll wait till the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice. "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " --Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's a hard question under Article II.   But I think the Article III questions that this Court is facing turn on what the parties in the case have alleged, what relief they're seeking, and what the posture is. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " In Federal court's jurisprudence, are you saying there's a lack of adversity here? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " I am saying primarily-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Can you give us a pigeonhole? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " --I -- it's a little difficult, because the circumstance is unusual, Justice Kennedy, but I think the most apt of the doctrines, although they are overlapping and reinforce each other, the most apt is standing.   This Court has made clear that a party on appeal has to meet the same Article III standing requirements of injury caused by the action complained of and redressable by the relief requested by the parties. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But it seems to me there -- there's injury here. "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I do not agree that the injuries alleged by the United States should be cognizable by the Article III courts, because those injuries are exactly what it asked the courts below to -- to produce.   But even if we treat the injuries as sufficiently alleged, Article III requires that the party complaining of injury ask the court to remedy that injury.   And that's a very important requirement, I think, under Article III for several reasons.   The idea of the case or controversy limitation, as I understand it, is part of a broader separation of powers picture, to make sure the Federal courts perform their proper role.   Their proper role is the redress of injury, and it is the need to redress injury in ordinary litigation that justifies judicial review of constitutional issues.   But-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Ms. Jackson, I mean, to go back to Justice Kennedy's point, we have injury here in the most classic, most concrete sense.   There's $300,000 that's going to come out of the Government's treasury if this decision is upheld, and it won't if it isn't.   Now, the Government is willing to pay that $300,000, would be happy to pay that $300,000, but whether the Government is happy or sad to pay that $300,000, the Government is still paying the $300,000, which in the usual set of circumstances is the classic Article III injury.   Why isn't it here? "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " --Justice Kagan, there is a three-prong test.   Even if you treat that as injury, it does not meet the requirements for standing on appeal, because the Government has not asked this Court to remedy that injury.   The Government has not asked this Court to overturn the rulings below so it doesn't have to pay the $365,000.   It has asked this Court to affirm.   And the case or controversy requirement that we're talking about are nested in an adversarial system where we rely on the parties to state their injuries and make their claims for relief.   If the Government or any party is not bound with respect to standing by its articulated request for a remedy, what that does is it enables the Court to fill in, to reshape.   And for a doctrine that is supposed to be limiting the occasions for judicial review of constitutionality, that is troubling. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But don't we often separate those two things, ask whether there's injury for Article III purposes and causation and redressability, as you say, but then say, well, sometimes when all of those are met, there's not going to be adequate presentation of the arguments, and so we will appoint an amicus or we'll restructure things?   And we do that when the Government confesses error, often.   I mean, we do that several times a year in this courtroom. "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   But concession of error cases, with respect, are quite different, because in concession of error cases typically both parties at the appellate level end up being adverse to the judgment below and they are asking relief from this Court from the judgment below.   But here we have a situation where, putting BLAG to one side for the moment, between the United States and Ms. Windsor there is no adversity, they're in agreement, and neither of them is asking this Court to reverse or modify the judgment below.   And so I think the confession of error cases are quite different from the perspective of Article III. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, they're -- they're not in agreement about whether to pay the money or not.   They are in agreement about what arguments are correct legal arguments, and I can't think of a case other than the sham cases which -- which this isn't, where -- where you would find no standing or other obstacle.   And I can think of one case, which you haven't mentioned, namely, Chadha, which seems about identical. "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " Your Honor, I don't think that Chadha is identical, with respect.   In -- for two main reasons.   In Chadha, the Court was I think quite careful to avoid deciding whether the United States had Article III standing.   It intensively analyzed a statute, since repealed, 1252, which gave this Court mandatory jurisdiction in cases in which a Federal statute was held unconstitutional and the U.S. was a party.   And it framed its analysis of whether the statute permitted the appeal.   What I think was -- oh, may I reserve my time for rebuttal? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You can finish your sentence. "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " Thank you.   What was -- what was going on there was the Court said: Well, the statute wanted to reach very broadly, perhaps implicit, not stated, perhaps more broadly than Article III.   Congress said whenever you have this configuration, you go up to the Supreme Court.   Then the Supreme Court in Chadha says, of course, in addition to the statute, there must be Article III case or controversy, the presence of the congressional intervenors here provides it.   And that-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   That was more than a sentence. "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " --Oh, I'm sorry.

There are two issues that have been -- that have been brought up this morning and I'd like to address each in turn.   One is whether there's a concrete case or controversy -- case or controversy in the sense of adversity in this Court; and the second is the question of whether there's Article III standing for the Government to bring this case before the Court.

Now, Your Honor is, of course, correct that the -- the Court didn't affirmatively engage on the issue of jurisdiction, but that is a scenario-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   So putting Lovett aside, since none of this was discussed, is there any, any case? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --No, I don't know of one.   But these -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, with all due respect-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So this is totally unprecedented.   You're asking us to do something we have never done before to reach the issue in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --Let me say two things about that if I might, Your Honor.   First is that it's -- it's unusual, but that's not at all surprising, because the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, it's not just -- it's not unusual.   It's totally unprecedented. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --Well, it's totally unprecedented in one respect, Your Honor.   If you look at Chadha -- okay, the second point I'd make.   Let me make one point at the outset, though, which is that whether it's totally unusual or largely unusual, I grant you that it doesn't happen.   But the reason it doesn't happen is because -- I wouldn't confuse a numerator with a denominator.   This set of circumstances just doesn't arise very often.   Now, it's true that when this set of circumstances-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It has not arisen very often in the past, because in the past, when I was at the Office of Legal Counsel, there was an opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel which says that the Attorney General will defend the laws of the United States, except in two circumstances: Number one, where the basis for the alleged unconstitutionality has to do with presidential powers.   When the presidential powers are involved, he's the lawyer for the President.   So he can say, we think the statute's unconstitutional, I won't defend it.   The second situation is where no possible rational argument could be made in defense of it.   Now, neither of those situations exists here.   And I'm wondering if we're living in this new world where the Attorney General can simply decide, yeah, it's unconstitutional, but it's not so unconstitutional that I'm not willing to enforce it, if we're in this new world, I -- I don't want these cases like this to come before this Court all the time.   And I think they will come all the time if that's -- if that's -- if that's the new regime in the Justice Department that we're dealing with. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --Justice Scalia, one recognized situation in which an act of Congress won't be defended in court is when the President makes a determination that the act is unconstitutional.   That's what happened here.   The President made an accountable legal determination that this Act of Congress is unconstitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But then why does he enforce the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Well, that's an option that's available to him, Justice Kennedy.   In certain circumstances, it makes sense not to enforce.   But I don't think the take-care responsibility is an all or nothing proposition such that when the President reaches a determination that a statute is unconstitutional, it necessarily follows that he wouldn't enforce it.   That's not what happened in Lovett.   That's not-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But let me ask you, suppose that constitutional scholars have grave doubts about the practice of the President signing a bill but saying that he thinks it's, unconstitutional -- what do you call it, signing statements or something like that.   It seems to me that if we adopt your position that that would ratify and confirm and encourage that questionable practice, because if the President thinks the law is unconstitutional he shouldn't sign it, according to some view.   And that's a lot like what you're arguing here.   It's very troubling. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --I -- in the -- in the signing statement situation, Your Honor, one example in the past is Turner Broadcasting.   In Turner Broadcasting, that was a circumstance in which it was -- it was a veto, but in the course of the veto the President made the determination that a particular aspect of that statute was unconstitutional.   And what happened as a result of that is that the Department of Justice didn't defend that aspect of the statute in litigation.   Now, a subsequent President reached a contrary conclusion.   But -- but my point is simply that when the President makes a determination that a statute is unconstitutional, it can follow that the Department of Justice won't defend it in litigation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sometimes you do and sometimes you don't.   What is the test for when you think your obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed means you'll follow your view about whether it's constitutional or not or you won't follow your view? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, I'd hesitate to give you a black-and-white algorithm.   There are -- there are several considerations that would factor into it.   One of the considerations-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me.   It's not your view.   It's the President's.   It's only when the President thinks it's unconstitutional that you can decline to defend it?   Or what if the Attorney General thinks it's unconstitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --No, no.   Of course-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Or the Solicitor General, is that enough? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --28 U.S.C. 530(d) presupposes -- Congress presupposes that there are going to be occasions in which a statute is -- is not defended because of a conclusion by the Attorney General that it's unconstitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Oh, it can be either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " It could be, but this is a situation in which the President made the determination.   And when the President makes that determination, there are a few considerations that I think would factor into the mix in determining whether enforcement will follow.   One of them would be the consequences of enforcement for the individuals who are affected.   And so, for example, I would assume that if it's a criminal statute that we're talking about, an enforcement would require criminal enforcement against somebody and -- which would beget criminal sanctions.   That may be-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So when Congress enacts a statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor General in his view thinks it's unconstitutional?

You're right that either of those scenarios is possible.   The reason that the Government appealed in this case is because the President made the determination that this statute would continue to be enforced, and that was out of respect for the Congress that enacted the law and the President who signed it, and out of respect for the role of the judiciary in saying what the law is.   The point of taking an appeal here is that the Government suffered an injury because a judgment was entered against the Government in the court of appeals.   That's a classic case for injury.

So don't run out of time on that. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " I -- I won't, Your Honor.   I'll be happy to turn -- turn to BLAG standing.   I would like to make a couple of points on the question of our own standing to bring the petition before the Court.   And I think Justice Breyer was right.   The key precedent here is Chadha.   Chadha establishes a couple of things.   First, Chadha establishes that there is aggrievement in the circumstances of this case.   And I don't see what the difference is between aggrievement for purposes of statutory -- the statutory analysis at issue in Chadha, and injury for purposes of Article III. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, how are you aggrieved?   \u201c Aggrieved \u201d means that you are deprived of your legal rights.   And you don't think that you've been deprived of your legal rights because your rights -- your obligations under the Constitution supercede DOMA, and you haven't been deprived of anything that you're entitled to under the Constitution.   So how are you aggrieved? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " I guess we'd -- I'd subscribe to the aggrievement analysis that the Court made in Chadha at pages 929 to 931 of its opinion.   And what the Court said is this:   \"When an agency of the United States is a party to a case in which an act of Congress that it administers is held unconstitutional, it is an aggrieved party. \"   \"The agency's status as an aggrieved party is not altered by the fact that the Executive may agree with the holding that the statute in question is unconstitutional. \"   That description is on all fours with the circumstances of this case. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could I just -- before you go on to the House group, could I just clear up something?   In your brief, you argue that you are representing all three branches of the Government, is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

I certainly would like to be able to do that, but I don't think I can, in all fairness, do that.   But I-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It seems very strange.   So in -- in a criminal case where it's the United States v.--   Smith, appearing before an Article III judge, the United States, the prosecutor is representing the court as well? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --Well, I think -- I guess what I would say is this: The United -- the United States -- the Executive Branch represents the sovereign interests of the United States before the Court.   It's not -- I think the point of this is that it's not that the Executive Branch is representing the Executive Branch alone.   The Executive Branch is representing the sovereign interests of the United States, and those interests would include the interests of the Congress that enacted the law, the interests of the President that signed it, and the interests of the Judiciary in pronouncing on what the law is.   And the course of action that the President chose to undertake here is in keeping with all of those considerations. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Srinivasan, Chadha says what you said it said about what it means to be aggrieved-- "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --but Chadha also left open the Article III question.   Why did Chadha leave it open if it's the same thing? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " I don't -- I don't know why Chadha didn't engage on it in particular.   I think part of it, Justice Kagan, is that the Court didn't have the methodology at that point in time that it does now.   I--   don't know that it neatly divided between those questions in the same way.   So yes, it left the Article III question open, but I think the question of Article III injury necessarily follows from aggrievement and I haven't -- I haven't heard a persuasive argument to the contrary.   If we were aggrieved in the circumstances of Chadha, it seems to me it necessarily follows that we're injured.   We're injured in a couple of ways.   An act of Congress has been declared unconstitutional, which Chadha itself says constitutes aggrievement and therefore constitutes injury.   In this case also, we're required to pay a judgment-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Didn't Chadha -- didn't Chadha suggest that Congress could have standing in -- in Chadha?

The second discussion at page 940, I think, deals with prudential considerations that this Court ought to take into account to make sure that it has a sufficient adverse presentation of the competing arguments before it.   And that's accounted for by an amicus type role, and I think that's what the Court had in mind in Chadha, because the two cases that are cited in support of that proposition were both cases in which there was an appointed amicus.   So that -- that deals with that aspect of Chadha.   The other aspect of Chadha is the sentence that I alluded to earlier.   And I guess I'm not -- I'm not going to tell you that that sentence doesn't bear on the issue at all, but I will say this: What's cited in that is 28 U.S.C. 1254.   So I think the point that was directly -- directly being made is that the House and Senate were parties for purposes of the statute and they were parties because they had intervened and so they had party status.

My point is that this was talking about whether they're a party for statutory purposes under 1254.   I don't read this to address the question of Article III standing.   On the question of Article III standing, I guess what I would say is this: Chadha at most, if it says anything about Article III standing -- and I don't know that it does with respect to the House or Senate -- at most what it would say was in the unique circumstances of that case, where you had a legislative veto that uniquely affected a congressional prerogative-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you take the position that Congress-- "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --there might be standing in that situation.

But what I would say is I just -- I would continue to resist the premise, which is that the House's prerogatives aren't at stake here.

But to say that any legislator has an interest on his own without that delegation to defend the law is to import in that context the public action into the Federal Government.

The cases I would point to help are Coleman v. Miller, Karcher v. May, and Arizonans for Official English.   And all of those -- I don't think Coleman involved any specific legislative authorization, but you can distinguish it, I suppose.   But in trying to distinguish it, keep in mind that this Court gave those 20 Senators not just standing to make the argument about the role of the lieutenant governor, but also gave them standing to make the separate argument, which is the only one this Court reached, because it was divided four to four on the lieutenant governor's role, the only issue that the Court reached is the issue whether prior ratification disabled them from subsequent legislation action, which is just a way of saying what they did was unconstitutional.   So I think Coleman is quite close.   Karcher, Arizonans against English, there was an authorization.   We would say H. Res.   5 is enough of authorization for these purposes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can you tell me where the authorization is here?   I know that there is a statute that gives the Senate specifically authorization to intervene and that there was consideration of extending that right to the House.   But the appointment of BLAG is strange to me, because it's not in a statute, it's in a House rule.   So where -- how does that constitute anything other than a private agreement among some Senators, the House leadership?   And where -- from where do they derive the right, the statutory right, to take on the power of representing the House in items outside of the House?

What -- Chadha makes the critical flipping of the switch that gives the House the ability to intervene as a party is that the Executive Branch declines to defend the statute.   So if the Senate wants to come in and basically take -- share argument time or something as an amicus, they can, but there's no need for them to participate as -- as a party.   And I would want to emphasize that in the lower courts, participation by a party is absolutely critical.   It doesn't make sense to have the party that wants to see the statute invalidated be in charge of the litigation in the district courts, because whether the statute is going to be invalidated is going to depend on what kind of record there is in the district court.   It'd be one thing, Justice Scalia, if all that happened is they entered consent judgment.   I suppose then the thing would end, and then in the long run, the Executive would be forced to do their job and actually defend these statutes-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And so yes, it takes two of them to make the law.   But each of their's participation is necessary to repeal a law.   So if the Executive wants to go into court and effectively seek the judicial repeal of a law, it makes sense that one house can essentially vindicate its role in our constitutional scheme by saying, wait a minute, we passed that law; it can't be repealed without our participation. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if the law is passed by a bare majority of one of the houses, then each member of that -- of that house who was part of the majority has the same interest in defending its constitutionality. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I don't think that's right after Raines, Justice Alito.   In Raines, this Court carefully distinguished between the situation of an individual legislator and the situation of one of the houses as a whole.   And it specifically said this might be a different case if we had that kind of vote.   And that's what you have here.   That's what you had in Chadha.   And again, I do think that -- I mean, the only alternatives here are really to say that the Executive absolutely must enforce these laws, and if they don't, I mean, because after all -- you know, I -- I really don't understand why it's -- if they're not going to -- if they've made a determination that the law is unconstitutional, why it makes any sense for them to continue to enforce the law and put executive officers in the position of doing something that the President has determined is unconstitutional.   I mean, think about the qualified immunity implications of that for a minute.   So that's problematic enough.   But if they're going to be able to do that and get anything more than a consent judgment, then the House is going to have to be able to play its role, and it's going to have to play the role of a party.   An amicus just doesn't get it done.   And I really think, in a sense, the Executive gives the game away by conceding that our participation as an amicus here is necessary to solve what would otherwise be a glaring adverseness problem.   Because once you recognize that we can participate as an amicus, you've essentially recognized that there's nothing inherently executive about coming in and defending the constitutionality of an act of Congress.   Or more to the point, there's nothing inherently unlegislative about coming in and making arguments in defense of the statute.   And if that's critical, absolutely necessary to ensure there's an adverse presentation of the issues, well, there's no reason the House should have to do that with one hand tied behind its back.   If its participation is necessary, it should participate as a full party.   And as I say, that's critically important in the lower courts so they can take depositions, build a factual record, and allow for a meaningful defense of the statute.   Because the alternative really puts the Executive Branch in an impossible position.   It's a conflict of interest.   They're the ones that are making litigation decisions to promote the defense of a statute they want to see invalidated.   And if you want to see the problems with their position, look at Joint Appendix page 437.   You will see the most anomalous motion to dismiss in the history of litigation: A motion to dismiss, filed by the United States, asking the district court not to dismiss the case.   I mean, that's what you get under their view of the world, and that doesn't serve as separation of powers. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " That -- that would give you intellectual whiplash.   I'm going to have to think about that.   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " It -- it does.   It does.   And then -- you know -- and the last thing I'll say is, we saw in this case certain appeals were expedited, certain appeals weren't.   They did not serve the interest of defending the statute, they served the distinct interest of the Executive.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Ms. Jackson, you have 4 minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Vicki C. Jackson", "text": " Thank you, Your Honor.   I have five points I'll try to get to.   Just very quickly, Justice Breyer, I only answered part of a question you asked me earlier, and I just want to say, the U.S. is asking this Court to tell it to pay money.   It's not asking for relief.   Justice Sotomayor, you asked me about how the issue could come up otherwise.   I don't think I had a chance to mention, private party litigation, employees against employers, there's an interpleader action right now pending that was cited in the brief of the 287 employers -- on page 32 at note 54 -- giving examples of how the issue of DOMA's constitutionality could arise in private litigation.   In addition, State and local government employees might have, for example, FMLA claims in which the issue could arise.   So I think that there are a number of ways in which the issue could arise.   On the question of what the purpose of 1252 could be if it wasn't to coincide with Article III injury that was raised by my -- my friend in his argument, I wonder whether the Court in Chadha wasn't saying something like this: 1252 was Congress's wish list.   It was like -- like a citizen suit provision, to be exercised only to the extent that Article III power was there.   That's a way to make sense out of what the Court is doing in the text and footnote there.   As to the question of BLAG, which has been very fully discussed already, I do want to say that after-the-fact authorization seems to me quite troubling and inconsistent with this Court's approach in Summers v. Earth Institute, and in the -- I think it was in the plurality in Lujan, where you -- you -- if a party has standing, they need to have it in the first court that they're in, either when it starts or certainly before judgment.   And the rule as Justice Sotomayor observed just doesn't seem to say anything about authority to litigate.   I think that in addition, the -- the big problem here is the injury being complained of is inconsistent with the separation of powers.   Bowsher and Buckley make very clear that once the litigation is enacted, Congress's authority to supervise it is at an end.   It goes over to the Executive Branch.   And whether the Executive Branch does it well or badly in the view of Congress, it's in its domain.   And separation of powers will not be meaningful if all it means is the Congress has to stay out unless it thinks that the President is doing it badly.   So I think Article II helps give shape to what kinds of injuries alleged by parts of Congress can be cognizable.   Finally, the three -- two or three cases cited by my colleague who last spoke: Coleman, Karcher and Arizona, all involved State level of government, where the Federal separation of powers doctrines articulated in cases like Bowsher and Buckley were not at issue.     Unless there are other questions, I will sit down. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

I would submit the basic principles of federalism suggest that as long as the Federal Government defines those terms solely for purposes of Federal law, that the Federal Government has the choice to adopt a constitutionally permissible definition or to borrow the terms of the statute.

But with the basic question of even whether to recognize the marriage -- or probably the best way to put it is just whether the Federal law treats you as married for a particular purpose or not, there always have been differences between the Federal law treatment and the State law treatment.

The Federal Government has long said, look, we are not going to allow you get a divorce every December just to get remarried in January so you'll have a filing tax status that works for you that is more favorable to you.   So the Federal Government has always treated this somewhat distinctly; it always has its own efforts; and I do think for purposes of the federalism issue, it really matters that all DOMA does is take this term where it appears in Federal law and define it for purposes of Federal law.   It would obviously be a radically different case if Congress had, in 1996, decided to try to stop States from defining marriage in a particular way or dictate how they would decide it in that way.

But when it has 1,100 laws, which in our society means that the Federal Government is intertwined with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at -- at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the State police power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody.

First of all, the very fact that there are 1,100 provisions of Federal law that define the terms \u201c marriage \u201d and \u201c spouse \u201d goes a long way to showing that Federal law has not just stayed completely out of these issues.   It's gotten involved in them in a variety of contexts where there is an independent Federal power that supported that.   Now, the second thing is the fact that DOMA affects all 1,100 statutes at once is not really a sign of its irrationality.   It is a sign that what it is, and all it has ever purported to be, is a definitional provision.   And like every other provision in the Dictionary Act, what it does is it defines the term wherever it appears in Federal law in a consistent way.   And that was part and parcel of what Congress was trying to accomplish with DOMA in 1996. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, but it's not really uniformity because it regulates only one aspect of marriage.   It doesn't regulate all of marriage. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, that's true but I don't think that's a mark against it for federalism purposes, and it -- it addressed a particular issue at a point, remember in 1996, Congress is addressing this issue because they are thinking that the State of Hawaii through its judicial action is about to change the definition of marriage from a way that it had been defined in every jurisdiction in the United States.   And what that meant is that when Congress passed every one of the statutes affected by DOMA's definition, the Congress that was passing that statute had in mind the traditional definition.   And so Congress in 1996 at that point says, the States are about to experiment with changing this, but the one thing we know is all these Federal statutes were passed with the traditional definition in mind.   And if rational basis is the test, it has to be rational for Congress then to say, well, we are going to reaffirm what this word has always meant for purposes of Federal law.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Suppose we look just at the estate tax provision that's at issue in this case, which provides specially favorable treatment to a married couple as opposed to any other individual or economic unit.

"}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I think for these purposes actually, Justice Alito, if you go back to the beginning of the estate tax deduction, what Congress was trying to do was trying to provide uniform treatment of taxpayers across jurisdictions, and if you look at the brief that Senator Hatch and some other Senators filed, they discussed this history, because what was happening in 1948 when this provision was initially put into Federal law was you had community property States and common law States, and actually there was much more favorable tax treatment if you were in a community law State than a common law State.   And Congress didn't want to have an artificial incentive for States to move from common law to community property; it wanted to treat citizens the same way no matter what State they were in.   So it said, we will give a uniform Federal deduction based on marriage, and I think what that shows is that when the Federal Government gets involved in the issue of marriage, it has a particularly acute interest in uniform treatment of people across State lines.   So Ms. Windsor wants to point to the unfairness of the differential treatment of treating two New York married couples differently, and of course for purposes of New York law that's exactly the right focus, but for purposes of Federal law it's much more rational for Congress to -- to say, and certainly a rational available choice, for Congress to say, we want to treat the same-sex couple in New York the same way as the committed same-sex couple in Oklahoma and treat them the same.

Or some States had a residence requirement of a year, some have six months, some have four months.   So Congress passes a law that says, well unless you're there for a year, no medical deduction, no tax thing, no benefits of any kind, that that would be perfectly constitutional.

I guess the question that this statute raises, this statute that does something that's really never been done before, is whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " --A couple of responses, Justice Kagan.   First of all, I think I would take issue with the premise, first of all, that this is such an unusual Federal involvement on an issue like marriage.   If you look at historically, not only has the Federal Government defined marriage for its own purposes distinctly in the context of particular -- particular programs, it's also intervened in -- in other areas, including in-state prerogatives.   I mean, there's a reason that four state constitutions include a prohibition on polygamy.   It's because the Federal Congress insisted on them.   There is a reason that, in the wake of the Civil War and in Reconstruction, Congress specifically wanted to provide benefits for spouses of freed slaves who fought for the Union.   In order to do it, it essentially had to create state law marriages, because in the Confederacy, the slaves couldn't get married.   So they developed their own State -- essentially, a Federal, sort of, condition to define who was married under those laws.   So where there was the needs in the past to get involved, the Federal Government has got involved.   The other point I would make -- but I also eventually want to get around to the animus point -- but the other point I would make is: When you look at Congress doing something that is unusual, that deviates from the way they -- they have proceeded in the past, you have to ask, Well, was there good reason?   And in a sense, you have to understand that, in 1996, something's happening that is, in a sense, forcing Congress to choose between its historic practice of deferring to the States and its historic practice of preferring uniformity.   Up until 1996, it essentially has it both ways: Every State has the traditional definition.   Congress knows that's the definition that's embedded in every Federal law.   So that's fine.   We can defer.   Okay.   1996-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, is what happened in 1996 -- and I'm going to quote from the House Report here -- is that   \"Congress decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. \"   Is that what happened in 1996?

We're going to look, and under rational basis, we look: Is there any rational basis for the statute?

Now, this statute is not called the Federal Uniform Marriage Benefits Act; it's called the Defense of Marriage Act.   And the reason for that is because the statute is not directed at uniformity in the administration of Federal benefits.   All -- there is two equally uniform systems, the system of respecting the State choices and the system of -- that BLAG is advocating here.   And what BLAG's got to do in order to satisfy equal protection scrutiny is justify the choice between one and the other, and the difference between the two is that the Section 3 choice is a choice that -- Section 3 choice is a choice that discriminates.   So it's not simply a matter sufficient to say, well, uniformity is enough.   Section 3 discriminates. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So as soon as one State adopted same sex marriage, the definition of marriage throughout the Federal code had to change?

Not that they were making the specific choice that my friend suggested they were.   But whatever is the case, when Congress enacted DOMA that choice of exclusion has to be justified under appropriate equal protection principles.   So the issue of uniformity just doesn't get you there, because there is no uniformity advantage to Section 3 of DOMA as opposed to the traditional rule.   The issue of administration doesn't get you there.   I mean, at a very basic level administrative concerns ought not be an important enough interest to justify this kind of a discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.   But even if you look at them, there are no genuine administrative benefits to DOMA.   If anything, Section 3 of DOMA makes Federal administration more difficult, because now the Federal Government has to look behind valid state marriage licenses and see whether they are about State marriages that are out of compliance with DOMA.   It's an additional administrative burden.   So there is no -- there is no administrative -- there is no administrative advantage to be gained here by what -- by what Congress sought to achieve.   And the fundamental reality of it is, and I think the House report makes this glaringly clear, is that DOMA was not enacted for any purpose of uniformity, administration, caution, pausing, any of that.   It was enacted to exclude same-sex married, lawfully married couples from Federal benefit regimes based on a conclusion that was driven by moral disapproval.

It may well have been what Garrett described as the simple want of careful reflection or an instinctive response to a class of people or a group of people who we perceive as alien or other.   But whatever the explanation, whether it's animus, whether it's that -- more subtle, more unthinking, more reflective kind of discrimination, Section 3 is discrimination.   And I think it's time for the Court to recognize that this discrimination, excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from Federal benefits, cannot be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law.   This is discrimination in its most very basic aspect, and the House Report, whether -- and I certainly would not suggest that it was universally motivated by something other than goodwill -- but the reality is that it was an expression of moral disapproval of exactly the kind that this Court said in Lawrence would not justify the law that was struck down there.

Moreover, Justice Alito, in connection with a whole host of Federal litigation, there has been Federal litigation for hundreds of years with respect to the residency of where people live or don't live, or whether they are divorced or not divorced throughout the Federal system.

No one has identified in this case, and I don't think we've heard it in the argument from my friend, any legitimate difference between married gay couples on the one hand and straight married couples on the other that can possibly explain the sweeping, undifferentiated and categorical discrimination of DOMA, Section 3 of DOMA.   And no one has identified any legitimate Federal interest that is being served by Congress's decision, for the first time in our nation's history to undermine the determinations of the sovereign States with respect to eligibility for marriage.   I would respectfully contend that this is because there is none.   Rather, as the title of the statute makes clear, DOMA was enacted to defend against the marriages of gay people.

States that have already resolved the cultural, the political, the moral -- whatever other controversies, they're resolved in those States.   And by fencing those couples off, couples who are already married, and treating them as unmarried for purposes of Federal law, you're not -- you're not taking it one step at a time, you're not promoting caution, you're putting a stop button on it, and you're having discrimination for the first time in our country's history against a class of married couples.

There is little doubt that the answer to the question of why Congress singled out gay people's marriages for disrespect through DOMA.   The answer can't be uniformity as we've discussed.   It can't be cost savings, because you still have to explain then why the cost savings is being wrought at the expense of married couples who are gay; and it can't be any of the State interests that weren't discussed, but questions of family law in parenting and marriage are done by the States, not by the Federal Government.

And only two of those referenda have ever lost.   One was in Arizona; it then passed a couple years later.   One was in Minnesota where they already have a statute on the books that prohibits marriages between gay people.   So I don't think -- and until 1990 gay people were not allowed to enter this country.   So I don't think that the political power of gay people today could possibly be seen within that framework, and certainly is analogous -- I think gay people are far weaker than the women were at the time of Frontiero.

"}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Ms. Kaplan.   Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, just three points in rebuttal.   First of all, I was not surprised to hear the Solicitor General concede that there is no unique federalism problem with DOMA, because in the Gill litigation in the First Circuit, the State of Massachusetts -- the Commonwealth of Massachusetts invoked the Tenth Amendment, and on that issue the United States continued to defend DOMA because there is no unique federalism problem with it, as the Chief Justice's question suggested.   If 10 years from now there are only 9 States left and Congress wants to adopt a uniform Federal law solely for Federal law purposes to going the other way, it is fully entitled to do that.   It has the power to do that.   I would say also the Federal Government has conceded in this litigation that there is a rational basis for this statute, something else to keep in mind.   I would also say that this provision is not so unique.   The very next provision in the Dictionary Act-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Rational basis, Mr. Clement -- is a problem in your briefing.   You seem to say and you repeat it today that there is three tiers, and if you get into rational basis then it's anything goes.   But the history of this Court is, in the very first gender discrimination case, Reed v. Reed, the Court did something it had never done in the history of the country under rational basis.   There was no intermediate tier then.   It was rational basis. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " --Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And yet the Court said this is rank discrimination and it failed. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " --And, Justice Ginsburg, applying rational basis to DOMA, I think that there are many rational bases that support it.   And the Solicitor General says, well, you know, the United States is not the 51st State to be sure, but the Federal Government has interests in uniformity that no other entity has.   And we heard today that there's a problem; when somebody moves from New York to North Carolina, they can lose their benefits.   The Federal Government uniquely, unlike the 50 States, can say, well, that doesn't make any sense, we are going to have the same rule.   We don't want somebody, if they are going to be transferred in the military from West Point to Fort Sill in Oklahoma, to resist the transfer because they are going to lose some benefits.   It makes sense to have a uniform Federal rule for the Federal Government.   It is not so anomalous that the term \u201c marriage \u201d is defined in the U.S. Code.   The very next provision of the Dictionary Act defines \u201c child \u201d.   These terms, although they are the primary province of State governments, do appear in multiple Federal statutes and it's a Federal role to define those terms.   The last point I would simply make is in thinking about animus, think about the fact that Congress asked the Justice Department three times about the constitutionality of the statute.   That's not what you do when you are motivated by animus.   The first two times they got back the answer it was constitutional.   The third time, they asked again in the wake of Romer, and they got the same answer: It's constitutional.   Now the Solicitor General wants to say:   Well, it was want of careful reflection?   Well, where do we get careful reflection in our system?   Generally, careful reflection comes in the democratic process.   The democratic process requires people to persuade people.   The reason there has been a sea change is a combination of political power, as defined by this Court's cases as getting the attention of lawmakers; certainly they have that.   But it's also persuasion.   That's what the democratic process requires.   You have to persuade somebody you're right.   You don't label them a bigot.   You don't label them as motivated by animus.   You persuade them you are right.   That's going on across the country.   Colorado, the State that brought you Amendment 2, has just recognized civil unions.   Maine, that was pointed to in the record in this case as being evidence of the persistence of discrimination because they voted down a statewide referendum, the next election cycle it came out the other way.   And the Federal Congress is not immune.   They repealed \u201c Don't Ask, Don't Tell \u201d.   Allow the democratic process to continue.   Thank you, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
