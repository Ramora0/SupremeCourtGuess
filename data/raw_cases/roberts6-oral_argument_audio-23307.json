But because Peggy Young's 20-pound lifting restriction resulted from her pregnancy and not from one of those conditions, UPS rejected her request.

"}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " --Well, I think the vehicle to bring the claim of the kind that I articulated is the second clause of the PDA.   The second clause of the PDA says that,   \"Women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions shall be treated the same as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work. \" "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " --You read that as an accommodation provision basically, and maybe -- maybe it is.   But let me ask you this question, which goes to the the issue of -- of whether the types of accommodations that you would say are required have to meet some reasonableness standard.   Let's say there are two categories of employees who have lifting restrictions in their job descriptions.   One consists of people who work alone and they lift all the time.   A driver who is driving a truck by herself and has to lift heavy packages all the time would fall into that category.   The second category would consist of people who lift more occasionally, and they do it in a place where there will always be lots of other employees in the same class available to do the lifting.   Now, if an accommodation is provided to the workers in the second category, would you say that one must also be provided to workers in the first? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " No, I don't think so.   So our point is precisely that a driver who is pregnant and who has a limitation related to her pregnancy is entitled to the same accommodation her employer would have given her if she had sought it for a different medical condition with the same effect on the ability to work. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But why -- why doesn't that fit why doesn't that second class fit within your reading of the statutory text? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " Well, so because, in our -- in our view, the statutory text, by saying -- by drawing this distinction between employees affected by pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions and not so affected, saying employers can't draw that distinction, excuse me, and saying instead they look only at the ability to work, what it does is it prohibits discrimination based on the source of the disabling condition.   It doesn't prohibit discrimination based on different job classifications.   If you have a driver -- if an employer says no driver who drives alone is going to get an accommodation whether for an on-the-job injury, a DOT disqualifying injury, or pregnancy, that's fine because it's the same treatment.   Because, Justice Alito, we do not read this statute as an independent, reasonable accommodation-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But why then I -- guess I'm not quite understanding why you pin get the source classifications into a different category from all other classifications.   So explain that to me. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " --Well, so, I mean, I think it -- it goes to the statutory text.   So, I mean, the statutory text says,   \"Women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same. \"   et cetera,   \"as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability to work. \"   What that -- what that text is saying -- is to an employer, don't consider whether this person is affected by pregnancy or not so affected.   That's not the basis on which you can compare this employee to other employees.   Instead, compare this employee based on ability to work.   And remember, this statutory text was adopted in response to General Electric v. Gilbert which upheld an employer policy that distinguished based on the source of the disabling condition, treated some kinds of disabling conditions differently from pregnancy-related disabling conditions. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But I think you're reading you have admitted that other persons can't really be read literally.   Other you have to read things into it.   And you would read into it people in the same job classification.   But if you can do that, then why can't you also read into it people whose injuries, whose disabilities have the same source? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " Because once you do that, then the second clause of the PDA doesn't occupy any space and then -- and Congress should have stopped with the first clause.   Congress was doing something with the second clause.   It was trying to overturn the Gilbert situation, where you had an employer that adopted a policy that, as a formal matter, treated pregnant people the same way it treated nonpregnant people.   If you were pregnant, but the reason that you weren't able to work was an off-the-job illness or injury, the General Electric policy in Gilbert would have given you disability benefits.   And what this Court said in the Gilbert case was that's not discrimination; it -- it simply doesn't include coverage for pregnancy, but pregnant women aren't fenced off.   What this statutory text does is it says: No, employers have to treat pregnancy-related conditions as favorably as they treat nonpregnancy-related conditions.   And that's in fact how this Court has read the statute since it's very first PDA case.   In Newport News, what this Court said was that the Act makes clear that it's discriminatory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably than other medical conditions.   And here UPS, with the three very large classes of employees that it provides accommodations to who are not pregnant, is treating pregnancyrelated conditions less favorably than other medical conditions. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So you do assert it's a -- it's a most favored nation provision.   You -- you have to give the benefits that you give to any other class of employees, right? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " To any other class of employees, I think that's right. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " How long -- it doesn't matter whether that class is enormous or small, right? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " Well, I -- so I think this is -- this is text that obviously requires some degree of interpretation.   I think Your Honor articulated one way of thinking about it, which is providing it -- providing this accommodation or benefit to employees generally.   And certainly, when an employer provides accommodations or benefits to such large classes of employees who are not pregnant, who are similar in the ability to work-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Does -- does the record show what you have asserted here, that the classes that are given special treatment is almost everybody? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " --Well, I think that we have-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Does the record show that? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " --I think -- I think the record is sufficient to show that.   Remember, summary judgment was granted against us. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I understand. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " Yes.   So I think the record is sufficient to show that in the following sense: So, number one, obviously, there's all the on-the-job injuries, which -- which UPS acknowledges they provide accommodations for.   Number two, DOT-disqualifying conditions that UPS provides accommodated work for; we have presented examples in the record of individuals who have off-the-job injuries, who are similar in their ability to work as Peggy Young, who have been given accommodated work, and UPS hasn't pointed to in its briefing here any driver with a similar lifting restriction to Peggy Young who was not pregnant who didn't get the accommodation. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You can win your case with that argument, perhaps. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " And I hope so, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes, assume that.   But that isn't going to help me, which I'm rather selfish about.   [Laughter]   Because my -- my job here is to write what this statute means for a lot of cases.   And writing the words, what it means is if you give a lot of benefits to a lot of employees, but not to the pregnant women and you don't give it to some employees and not to the pregnant women, and the employer says, look, pregnant women are like the few we don't give it to, not to the lot we do give it to, employer, you lose.   But by the time I've written that into the U.S. Code, nobody knows what I'm talking about.   Do you understand?   I -- I need to know how to interpret the words such that they would do, in your view, what you want them to do, which is just what I said. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " Yes.   And so -- and I think the important point is if an employer provides accommodations as a matter of policy to a class of employees who are not pregnant, who are similar in their ability or inability to work to the pregnant plaintiff and does not provide the same accommodation or benefit to the pregnant plaintiff, it is violating the plain text of the statute, which says that women affected by pregnancy-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Most favored nation.

But to return to Justice Scalia's response there, I mean, the point is the text contains no such limitation.   And on-the-job/off-the-job distinctions were certainly known to Congress at the time it adopted this -- it adopted this statute.   In fact, General Electric v. Gilbert involved a policy that contained an on-the-job/off-the-job distinction, although the flip side of the one in this case.   If Congress meant to say that employers have an exception from the general \u201c shall be treated the same \u201d requirement for an on-the-job/off-the-job distinction, it could have said so.

The second clause of the PDA advances that interest in a narrow but important way.   I say the second clause is narrow because it is not a freestanding accommodation requirement like the religious provision of Title VII or like the ADA.   And I say it is narrow because there's only one thing that an employer can't do when it affords benefits or accommodations.   It can't draw distinctions that treat pregnancy-related medical conditions worse than other conditions with comparable effects on ability to work.

And if I could turn to that, I think -- and I hopefully in doing so will answer your question, Justice Alito, and also yours, Justice Kagan.   Here's why we think the statutory text -- and if -- maybe it would help if I restated what I think the rule is and then explain where the textual basis comes from.   We think the one thing an employer can't do as a result of the second clause is draw distinctions that treat pregnancy-related medical conditions worse than other conditions with comparable effects on ability to work.   It's that single thing.   And so seniority, fulltime work, different job classifications, all of those things would be permissible distinctions for an employer to make to differentiate among who gets benefits.   Now, as for the textual basis, I'm looking at the -- at the statute here, which is -- we've got it at page 12 and 13 of our brief and it's also in the last page of the appendix to the petition.   It says that -- what it says is that among the class of people who are comparable in their ability to work,   \"in other words, similar in their ability or inability to work, as the statute says, women with a pregnancy-related medical condition, in other words, women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition, as the statute says, can't be treated worse on the basis of their condition -- that's what we think. \"   treated the same   \"means in the statute -- than other workers with nonpregnancy-related medical conditions that impose comparable limitations. \"   \"Those are other persons not so affected. \" "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Would you give me your interpolation again?   You -- you altered the phrase and the words you added were? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B.

"}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, but you start -- you've got -- at the very beginning, you listed three things that you said were reasonable distinctions.   Because the word I'd like you to focus on is \u201c other workers \u201d and the problem is which other workers?   Because it is easy to construct hypothetical cases where the work -- the employer treats some other workers the same as the statute and doesn't others.   And which distinctions are reasonable and which ones are not, and how do we tell? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " I'd like to make two points in response, Justice Breyer.   The first about the nature of the Title VII claim and the second about the nature of this kind of an antidiscrimination provision.   With respect to the first, I think it's helpful to differentiate between a direct claim of discrimination, disparate treatment, versus a claim proven through the McDonnell Douglas framework.   Now, we think in order to prove a direct claim without going through the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis, what you've got to show is that an employer offers an accommodation to a significant class of employees and that that accommodation fails the test I described earlier.   It's got to be a significant class.   Now, we think that's this case.   We think that's going to be most cases.   But in the kinds of examples that Your Honor identified, the one guy driving across the mountain, for example, I think you'd have two issues there: First, when it's one person, you're not going to be able to make a direct case.   You go through McDonnell Douglas and the employer may well have an explanation for that accommodation that would take it outside the source of the disability limitation and mean there's no liability.   And then with respect to that example there's a second point to be made, I think, which is that that person who has to drive the particularly dangerous route, for example, may just well be in a different job category and, therefore, not similar in ability or-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I would have thought it's those types of cases that present the starkest example of discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, the idiosyncratic one.   Oh, well, he's doing this, yes, but he's doing that and then the pregnant woman comes in and says, ah, you know, that's not the same thing.   I thought maybe it's the the sort of the isolated examples that would be particularly glaring in their discriminatory treatment. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " --Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I guess what I would say about that is that you could certainly bring a McDonnell Douglas claim against an individual idiosyncratic difference, but then if the employer can show that the accommodation was granted to one not on the basis of a criterion that this sentence in the PDA would forbid, then the employer's -- then the -- then the accommodation is fine, there's no violation.   And to get back to the point-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's the -- that's -- I used the idiosyncratic example, not because I'm interested in it, because I think it illustrates something that isn't idiosyncratic.   And what I use it to illustrate is the fact that, as here, employers will have classes of people and the classes may be based on all kinds of different things.   But this is a case where there are classes and some get the benefits equivalent to the pregnancy and some don't.   And how are we supposed to tell which are the criteria that are consistent with the statute and which are not?   That's what I found as the difficult question in the case.   And that's why I ask it using the idiosyncratic, simply to illustrate what I think is the problem. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " --Yes, of course.   Let me get to the second point I wanted to make in response to your question, and then I'll try, after I do that, to give you a very specific response to what you just asked me.   The second point is, you know, it is true that some classes are going to be in and some classes are going to be out, but that's how discrimination law operates.   If an employer is discriminating against women in promotions, the fact that an employer is also discriminating against overweight men in promotions doesn't make the discrimination against women any less actionable because it just reflects the choice Congress made about whom to protect and whom not to protect.   And here, the choice Congress made on whom to protect and whom not to protect is the choice to protect women who have conditions -- pregnancy-related medical conditions.   That's the congressional judgment here.   They didn't choose to protect everybody who gets injured off the job.   They chose to protect those with pregnancy-related medical conditions.

It's about on the job versus off the job plus the DOT certification category, which can include people who lose their DOT certification and can't drive as a result of physical conditions other than pregnancy that prevent them from doing the job they have to do, which could include lifting.

What Congress said in the second clause, the key words are \u201c the same as other persons \u201d.   What \u201c other \u201d means is simply distinct from whatever is mentioned first.

What I'm saying is that in a pregnancy discrimination case, instead of comparing women with men as you would in a typical sex discrimination case, because what the first clause does is bolt pregnancy on to sex discrimination.   And so if you compare women and men in a pregnancy discrimination case where you have a policy that facially discriminates against pregnancy, you will nonetheless conclude that there's not sex discrimination because there will be women who are pregnant in the disfavored group, but there will also be women who are not pregnant in the favored group along with men.

What Petitioner's interpretation and the government's interpretation would do would actually be to rewrite those words in one of two ways.   Initially, Petitioner seemed to be suggesting that if a plaintiff could identify any other single employee who was accommodated that the pregnant employee would be entitled to the same accommodation.   What that would mean is the statute would have to read   \"the same as any other person. \"   It does not.   Now Petitioner and the government are both suggesting that the only restriction that this bars is a restriction based on source.   Any other restriction, rank, seniority status, outside legal obligations, are acceptable.

Which is -- what we ought to be thinking about is McDonnell Douglas.   In other words, this -- this provides the comparator.   It says an employee can find a class of people who are being given an accommodation notwithstanding that those people are similarly situated with respect to work.   An employee points to that class.   And then in a typical McDonnell Douglas fashion, the employer comes back and says: No, there is a good reason why I'm treating that class differently that has nothing to do with pregnancy.   It has something to do with I always treat more senior employees differently or something like that.   And at that point, if the if the employer makes his case, the employee gets to come back and say, no, that is a pretext, in just the way we do with every other discrimination case.   And that's what this is all about.   It's identifying the comparator that the employee has to identify in the first instance in order to shift the burden to the government to come back with a reason.

The words in the first clause are \u201c because of \u201d.   And this Court has consistently understood those words across protected traits to require that discrimination -- in an intentional discrimination case, that you have discrimination that is actually motivated by the protected trait.   If the second clause does the work Petitioner suggests, even if you could find the word \u201c source \u201d in that where it's not in the text, it would mean that you don't need to show that the protected trait, pregnancy, actually motivated the adverse treatment.

With respect to the EEOC guidance, the guidance which was issued two weeks after this Court granted certiorari is 180-degree change from the position that the government has consistently taken and that the postal service, which UPS fairly looked to in trying to ascertain what appropriate conduct was under federal antidiscrimination laws, the policy that it still has in place today.   In addition, the process in issuing that guidance was incredibly rushed.   It was not until 2012, as one of the amicus briefs point out, that the EEOC even identified the question of pregnancy accommodations as an emerging or developing issue.   There was no notice and comment.   The three-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The original -- the--   --The original the original guideline, as I understand EEOC, what they did in 2014, they said, we were terse the first time around.

Halligan", "text": " --'79 guidelines, the '79 53 guidelines simply mimic the language of the statute.   In 2012 the EEOC, in its strategic plan, said that it was looking at addressing the very issue that it opined on in the 2014 guidance as emerging.   If the 1979 guidelines stood for what Petitioner suggests, there would have been no need to treat it as emerging.   It would have been settled 30 years ago.   Finally, I want to point out that this is an area where the democratic process is working as it should and as this Court instructed it should in Cal Fed. In Cal Fed, this Court looked at the question of whether or not state statutes which provided preferential treatment to pregnant employees, the statute there provided extra leave and reinstatement rights to pregnant employees, was preempted by the PDA.   The Court said the PDA sets a floor.   That floor is that you can't single out pregnancy for adverse treatment.   States can go beyond that as additional and new challenges are identified. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Ms. Halligan, for the democratic process to work as it should, the PDA has to be given a fair reading.   And what we know about the PDA is that it was supposed to be about removing stereotypes of pregnant women as marginal workers.   It was supposed to be about ensuring that they wouldn't be unfairly excluded from the workplace.   And what you are saying is that there's a policy that accommodates some workers, but puts all pregnant women on one side of the line.   And what you are further saying is that the employer doesn't even have to justify that policy ala McDonnell Douglas.   That seems to me a reading of the statute, the PDA, that ignores two-thirds of the text. "}, {"speaker": "Caitlin J. Halligan", "text": " I'm not saying that the employer isn't subject to a suit under McDonnell Douglas.   I'm saying that there are no valid comparators here.   That's -- that's all -- all that we're saying in that regard.   The states that-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --So essentially it says any group that doesn't get the benefit, a group that is nonpregnant, then pregnant people are any group at all? "}, {"speaker": "Caitlin J. Halligan", "text": " --If you had a policy, I'm not sure what one would look like, that singled out pregnant employees plus one other employee, my guess is that you'd find-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What category of employees? "}, {"speaker": "Caitlin J. Halligan", "text": " --The policy that's at issue here, Justice Ginsburg, distinguishes on-the-job versus off-the-job injuries.   That's a distinction that's echoed in state and in federal law.   That's a far cry from a policy that singles out pregnant women.   There are nine states that-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Singling out is in the first -- is what the first-- "}, {"speaker": "Caitlin J. Halligan", "text": " --Or targeting or otherwise primarily disadvantaging.   That distinction tracks what workers' comp requires, which is payment for employees who are injured on the job, and many employers, including the U.S. Postal Service, have found it advantageous to provide lightduty accommodations so their employees can be at work while they are rehabilitating and provide some productive work for the company.   That distinction is as legitimate as you could get.   I see my time is up, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Bagenstos, you have four minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   So I'd like to begin, if I could, with the facts, because Justice Alito did ask, and, yes, we certainly do disagree with UPS's -- UPS's assertion here.   This case was on summary judgment and UPS does point correctly to some very general statements in the record by UPS managers that they never authorized these accommodations.   However, we point to specific examples in the record of people with off-the-job injuries or illnesses who were DOT decertified who were given accommodations, and not just accommodations that remove them from driving but also remove them from heavy lifting.   That's a factual dispute that has to go to trial. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You really think that you could prove at trial that if somebody is injured in a recreational activity over the weekend that they get light duty but a pregnant women does not maybe? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " So if someone is injured over the weekend in a way that leads them to be DOT decertified, yes, and in fact, the UPS manager so testified about his sports injury.   We cite that in our opening brief.   So yes, we think so.   The second point I'd like to make is about what the two clauses do, and I think this is very important.   So the first clause of the PDA, as this Court has said in Newport News and Cal Fed, overturns the reasoning in General Electric v. Gilbert.   So what the first clause says is where Gilbert said, look, discrimination based on pregnancy isn't sex discrimination because there are pregnant women and nonpregnant persons, that's wrong instead because a pregnancy is because of sex definitionally.   That's not what the second clause does, that's what the first clause does.   The second clause, as this Court said again in Newport News and Cal Fed, goes further and overrules the holding.   And I think Justice Kagan was exactly correct in describing the facts of Gilbert, that the Gilbert holding would not be overturned by -- under UPS's reading here because the Gilbert policy, the one thing we know that Congress meant to say was illegal, the Gilbert policy itself acted, drew lines in pregnancy neutral ways.   It said if you have an off-the-job injury or accident, defined as an off-the-job illness or accident defined as an accidental injury, then you get disability benefits.   It just so happens pregnancy isn't an illness and pregnancy isn't an accident in the sense of an accidental injury.   And what Congress -- we know Congress was trying to do, because Congress said it and this Court has said it, is to overturn the holding there.   But UPS's rule simply reprices the rule at issue in Gilbert.   If I might return to the point Justice Breyer's made a couple of times at various points in the argument-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Actually I think the reverse.   The second sentence is what does that.   The second sentence says you don't worry about whether it's between sexes.   You worry about whether the same class of people, people who are injured off-duty, are being treated differently when they have the same ability to work. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " --Well, I think, Justice Sotomayor, the first clause says you don't worry about whether they're the same sex or not.   You don't look at-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, you do have to worry about it because it still has to be sex discrimination. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel R. Bagenstos", "text": " --Well, no.   But the first clause definitionally defines pregnancy discrimination as sex discrimination.   It says if you're discriminating because of pregnancy, that is because of sex.   And that's the -- that's overturning the Gilbert reasoning coming from Geduldig that pregnancy discrimination isn't sex discrimination.   The second clause goes further, as this Court's explained, and overturns the holding, overturns the holding upholding the General Electric policy.   And so -- and I think under -- under UPS's rule it wouldn't do that.   On Justice Breyer's question, basically how do we deal with a world where there's an employer that treats two different groups of people who are nonpregnant differently?   Does \u201c shall be treated the same \u201d mean shall be treated the same as those who get the better deal or those who get the worst deal; right?   And I think Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan I think articulated this well, that their position really would give least favored nation status to pregnant workers and we know that that can't be something that Congress intended.   We know that in part because of what General Verrilli said, that that's not how antidiscrimination law works, the fact that someone else was discriminated against doesn't mean I lose.   Justice Alito's opinion for the Third Circuit in the Fraternal Order of Police of Newark case articulates the same rule.   We know that as well because the purpose of this statute is to say to employers, as Justice Kagan said, you have to treat pregnant workers as just as valued employees as anybody else, and if you think it's valuable to keep these employees on the job who are injured on the job because they keep valuable work -- valuable knowledge within the company, do that for pregnant women.
