Waxman", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a defendant maintains his innocence and insists on testing the prosecution on its burden of proof, the Constitution prohibits a trial court from permitting the defendant's own lawyer, over the defendant's objection, to tell the jury that he is guilty. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a personal defense that belongs to the accused, and whether to admit or contest guilt is the paradigmatic example of that personal defense, not only because it singularly affects the life and liberty of the accused, but also because making that decision requires weighing subjective aspirations and value judgments that are unique to every individual.   How -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Suppose the -- the charge is murder and -- and the lawyer says: Based on what I've looked -- I think your best case is self-defense, you know.   And -- and the other guy's -- the defendant says: No, I didn't shoot the person.   And the lawyer says: Well, I think the evidence is going to show that you did, self-defense. If the lawyer goes ahead and presents that defense, is -- does that fall under your theory? "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, I think your question raises a question both of what defense counsel may constitutionally do and also what defense counsel may not constitutionally do. I'll also note first that your hypothetical, in dramatic contrast to this case, involves, at a minimum, the shared objective of obtaining a -- an acquittal on the charged crimes. But, in addition, our position is that the one thing that counsel in that case and in no case may do is -- this isn't about what counsel can argue.   It's not about what evidence can be introduced.   It's that counsel may not stand up and affirmatively vouch, admit that his client is guilty. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " That was -- "}, {"speaker": "Seth P.

So recognizing that that is not this case, our position is -- and I think the framers utterly would agree -- that if a defendant stands up and says, look, I did not shoot that guy, as Mr. McCoy said, I did not kill my own family members and I do not want my lawyer standing up and telling the jury that I did -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

"}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " No, no, no.   You don't -- the -- the client doesn't get to decide what you will affirmatively say.

Crossing state lines, that's clearly proved, but we want to talk about these other things.   So that violates this fundamental right? "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " Just so that we're -- you and I are very clear about this, we don't think that this case presents the question because this is a case in which -- in which there was not an agreement on whether to pursue acquittal.

And I just want to make sure that I understand that your position is that the lawyer cannot vouch for any element of the defense, not just that, you know, it was self-defense, not that you didn't shoot him, all that, but any element of an offense, if the lawyer tells the jury that that's satisfied contrary to the client's wishes, that violates the -- "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " Our position is that the defense that the framers enshrined in the Sixth Amendment and that is recognized in the entire rest of the common law world is that, whether it's admitting guilt or not, if the defendant says I did not do X, I did not kill my parents -- my family members, defense counsel may not affirmatively tell the jury that he did and ask that he be required to spend the rest of his life in prison.

The defense lawyer doesn't have to say to the jury -- he doesn't have to say one word about crossing state lines. What he can't say is: I am telling you that Mr. McCoy killed these three family members. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Your answer is that -- this is fairly simple.   The -- the defense attorney cannot concede any element of the defense -- of -- of the offense. "}, {"speaker": "Seth P.

Breyer", "text": " Right there is the problem.   I mean, that's the problem in my mind. Faretta itself poses a problem because a large percentage of the people that insist on representing themselves, particularly in death cases, are going to walk right into the death -- the death chamber.   A lot of the people there are just not really capable of managing their own defense. So now we have a lawyer.   And, suddenly, we come in with a constitutional rule that's going to tell the lawyer how to argue his case.   How do I know what you say is true? The people who know this are the trial bar, if anybody.   But how do you know whether there are cases where, in fact, to make a sensible defense for this person who might have one, the lawyer has to say to the jury, because of what other witnesses have said and so forth, that letter did cross state lines? And if we agree with you in this, which is a very different case, the argument against agreeing with you in this is it will be like a balloon expanding into we don't know where what, because they're filled with elements, the federal code.   And before you know it, lawyers will have a hard time defending this person.   And you're walking right into jail when you start telling your lawyer how to run his case. Now, that's the concern that I think is there in the Chief's question.   And I -- I would like to know your response to what I consider a very practical concern. "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " My response, as Your Honor's question noted, is there is -- there is no need for this Court to decide the elements question or any other hypothetical in which there is a shared objective of acquittal in order to decide this case.

And our position is simply this: We are talking about the defense that was enshrined in the Sixth Amendment, and there is no contest from the state about the contemporary understanding of this at the time. But if -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But, Mr. Waxman, if we have to draw a line, it seems to me we have at least two axes we have to worry about.   One is, where do we stop on the concession? You say it goes down to elements. I -- I -- I press you why it wouldn't go further than that, if the client instructs the lawyer not to accede to admission of a piece of evidence as particularly damning but the lawyer sees no good faith basis for objecting. "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- why -- why doesn't it go down to that level? That's one axis. "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " The -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " The other axis would be you say it's -- the lawyer can't admit the element.   But what if the lawyer casts doubt on the element? I mean, what if the lawyer here hadn't admitted guilt but had presented a mens rea defense that really cast aspersions on the actus reus defense, right, it really cast -- any reasonable person would know what the lawyer is up to.   He didn't use the magic words \"I admit,\" but he did, in fact, essentially do that. So we have ambiguity on both these axes.   Where would we draw the lines? "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " So I think this Court has been -- as to your first axis, the Court has been very, very clear that decisions, once a -- once a defendant chooses to be represented by counsel, decisions about what evidence to admit, what objections to raise, what witnesses to call, with the exception of the defendant, and what witnesses not to call and what arguments to be made are for the lawyer, reviewable if at all under the ineffective assistance of counsel defense. So evidence, arguments, witnesses, this case is only about -- and you say there's a small difference, but this is all the difference in the world. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But sometimes -- sometimes -- sometimes, though, a piece of evidence is far more important than an element. Take -- take the Chief Justice's example of a Hobbs Act.   I mean, the interstate commerce element is usually not that big a deal in those cases.   But admission of a piece, a letter or, you know, an admission by the defendant is a huge deal. "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " I mean, in the real world, what defendants object to -- and I've been representing death row inmates for -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I know. "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " -- this is my 40th year -- defendants are not drawing a line and saying you can't admit that something moved in interstate commerce across state lines.   What they are concerned about and what they have an -- an autonomy, dignitary right to have protected is I didn't do this, I didn't commit the actus reus. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Waxman, may I -- may I ask if we -- if we concede the general proposition that you're right, the client has a right to say I didn't do it, but that's a defense.   And what the client wants to put on to make out that defense, the lawyer says I can't present that because you say there are witnesses, I've talked to the witnesses, they say the opposite.   I can't put on the defense. So if -- if -- take this very case. So the lawyer can't say: My client shot these three people.   But then what? What -- what -- how -- how does the lawyer back up that defense, I didn't do it, when, in the lawyer's view, there is no basis for taking that position? "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, the defendants, and even clients in civil cases, all the time do things that make counsel's job either difficult or impossible. The defendant can say: Look, I don't care, I am going to testify and I am going to give my side of the story, or I don't care, I've instructed all of my family members not to talk to you, not to provide you any information. The lawyer's professional responsibility, nonetheless, is just exactly how Justice White explained it at pages 257 and 258 of his opinion in United States versus Wade. What happens in these cases is that the lawyer doesn't have -- the -- the principle at stake here is not in any way a restriction on how the lawyer presents evidence, what defenses he actually does present, how he goes about cross-examining witnesses.

Waxman", "text": " The -- the lawyer will cross-examine the government's witnesses, as Justice White explained, attempting to find holes in their testimony even if the lawyer believes that they are testifying truthfully.

And if the judge or someone objects that your -- that this person's rambling on, you say to the judge: I cannot ask questions.   My client has directed me to put him or her on the stand.

So let's imagine a case where the evidence of the actus reus is overwhelming, there's not a chance in the world that the defense is going to be able to convince a jury that the defendant did not commit the actus reus, but there's a plausible defense, maybe a pretty good defense, on mens rea. So -- but the client insists: I didn't do it, I did not commit the actus reus. Now, two ways of -- of approaching this on the part of the defendant -- defense attorney, and I want you to explain whether one is required or whether -- whether both are permissible or only one is permissible. One is for the attorney to concede in the opening, yes, he committed the actus reus, but there's a good mens rea defense, and develop that. I take it you would say that's not permissible?

There's no attempt to put the government to its proof, to try to poke holes in the witnesses who are going to be called to establish the actus reus. Is the latter permitted? "}, {"speaker": "Seth P.

But there are different levels of generality, right? One is you can't say that I didn't kill my family.   One is you -- you -- you can't say that I committed the actus reus no matter what the actus reus is.   And another is you can't say that I committed any element of the offense, actus reus or otherwise.

And we -- we go over this at some length in our brief.   There's no controversion about this.   I think that at the time in the 18th century in England and common law jurisdictions and at the time of the framing of the Sixth Amendment, the frame -- people would have been astonished, as the -- as the amicus brief of the bar of England and Wales expresses, that the notion that the defendant could say this is my defense and my decision to contest this invokes my own subjective judgments about what is important to me and what is not important to me, that it would be -- they would be astonished to hear that in that circumstance defense counsel could stand up and say -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Waxman, I -- I -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

There was very little more that they could do to protect the record once trial had started, once they were at the point where they were choosing a jury. So -- so I think that it was a very, very complicated situation and that when we get to that point, then it needs to be a Strickland question -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I -- I still -- "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Murrill", "text": " -- because it's too hard. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- and when you say Strickland question, the -- the client says I didn't do it and I have a right to take that position.   You agree that the client has a right to take that position? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Murrill", "text": " Certainly, Your Honor, I think the client can take that position. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So the client can do that.   And the client can say: When my lawyer tells you that I did it, he has violated my privilege against self-incrimination.   He has incriminated me.   He has said I've done something that I haven't conceded that I've done.   What happened to my Fifth Amendment privilege? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Murrill", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, I think that the Fifth Amendment could be implicated in certain factual scenarios.   I think in this particular case what we saw were a -- a repeated, consistent sequence of waivers of the Fifth Amendment so that everything he said was already in the record; that he had repeatedly put this information with his alibi statements and his statements in the court where the court continued to Miranda and read him his rights over and over and over again. And -- and so all of this information was in the record, and now counsel has to cope with it.   And that was part of the problem too. So it -- it -- it is a -- a situation where you certainly had a very difficult client.   You had a death penalty case.   We are very near the -- two days before trial, and that's where we are suggesting you draw the line and treat it as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but not that it doesn't implicate other rights potentially, depending on when it happens.

I'll try to make five points: First, Justice Gorsuch, this is structural error.   The fact of the matter is that this was presented to the trial court not once but twice on the record that what the defendant was asking for is: I don't want my lawyer to admit that I am guilty, and the trial court's ruling in this case made that structural error and not ineffective -- not properly viewed as ineffective assistance of counsel.   Just as in Gonzalez-Lopez and in Faretta, it was structural error. Second, the notion that what Mr. McCoy was asking for was not that his lawyer not stand up and admit that he was guilty but that he -- he insists on putting on an alibi defense is simply refuted by the record. At page 398 of the Joint Appendix, this is during an argument in -- six months before the trial, the argument was all about whether his -- Mr. McCoy's subpoenas had to be enforced or not and whether Mr. English should be supporting him. Mr. McCoy tells the court: I am not asking him to validate any theory.   This was -- there was a dispute about whether Mr. English was, in fact, investigating his alibi defense. If there ever were a subsequent hearing about that, that would be tested. But this is flat out a case in which the judge was told as soon as this issue arose, twice on the record: I believe that I have an ethical duty to save my client's life; and the client telling the judge: I do not want my lawyer admitting that I am guilty.   That's structural error. Number 2, Justice Breyer, this was absolutely an admission of the charge -- guilt on the charged crime.   At opening and at closing, Mr. English got up and said: I am telling you he is guilty of second-degree murder and he should spend the rest of his life in prison. And under -- under Louisiana law, the jury -- the jury was required to be given the choice, the following choices, which it was: murder 1, murder 2, manslaughter, and not guilty.   And there is no dispute in the record that murder 1, murder 2, and manslaughter all have exactly the same mens rea defense as murder 1.   That is not what distinguishes those crimes. As to Cronic, as -- as we've said, we don't think -- I -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You can finish your third point. "}, {"speaker": "Seth P. Waxman", "text": " As to Cronic, we don't think this is an ineffective assistance of counsel case, but it surely is -- it surely is Cronic if it were because if the constitutional right to defend means anything, it means the right to decide to test the prosecution on its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
