"}, {"speaker": "Candace Cain", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Recognizing that certain offenders convicted before enactment or implementation of SORNA would be unable to comply with SORNA's initial registration requirement, Congress included section 16913(d) delegating to the Attorney General the authority to determine whether and how to apply SORNA's registration requirements to those offenders.   Mr. Reynolds is one of those offenders because he was convicted, sentenced and released from prison a year before SORNA was enacted.   But for a valid Mr. Chief Justice, and may it exercise of the Attorney General's authority under subsection (d), Mr. Reynolds had no obligation to register SORNA, could not initially register under SORNA, and therefore was not subject to SORNA's criminal penalties.   Action by the Attorney General was needed to bring offenders like Mr. Reynolds into the new system, and because those implementing SORNA, in determining whether and how SORNA would be applied to pre-enactment offenders, would require time and consideration, Congress left the Wetterling Act registration law in place for 3 years to ensure that all offenders would be covered under the old law.

If SORNA would apply to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation offenders on day 1, and the Attorney General could then modify in the future, which would in fact -- in effect repeal SORNA as to some offenders, then you could have a situation where someone was convicted of an offense and then have to be covered under SORNA, and then later the AG could decide that that group was not required to register.

Do we have other examples where Congress says, well, we don't know whether this should be a criminal offense, so we're going to leave it to the Attorney General?   It's quite different to say the Attorney General will implement it in the technical details, but to say that whether it's a criminal offense or not is up to the Attorney General, is there any other instance where that's so?

You know, it will be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it is and it won't be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it isn't.   I -- I don't know of any parallel and -- and I -- I think it's -- it's sailing close to the edge of unconstitutionality; whereas, what the other side claims is simply, it's a crime to begin with, but the Attorney General can make it not a crime.   That's sort of like prosecutorial discretion.   In -- in his -- in his judgment, if it shouldn't be a crime, you know -- I have trouble with that, too.   But it's a lot closer to prosecutorial discretion than -- than -- than what you're asking us to accept, that something is a crime only if the Attorney General says it's a crime.   seems to me very strange.

And an example of a permutation that was going to have some cloth for consideration is the one that's sort of an example in a different context, in the federal register and in the government's brief which is that certain people who had served their time and were completely out of the system, if they got rearrested for a misdemeanor, the Attorney General decided that those individuals did not have to register for a state to be deemed substantially implemented with respect to SORNA.

Justice Kagan, to get to your question about why is it all so complicated, our answer is that it really is not.   There is no reason why it couldn't have applied on day 1 to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation offenders.

They are already initially registered.   It's the very same State registry system that's created -- that's SORNA.   There is no creation of any SORNA registry and the statute itself doesn't talk about a SORNA compliant registry.   To the contrary, it defines a sex offender registry in 16911, subsection 9.   It's on page 10A of our brief.   It defines a sex offender registry as a registry of sex offenders maintained by a jurisdiction.   So these are the same registries that have been in existence in all 50 States for the last decade.   So offenders like Reynolds don't have to do anything under (b); (b) simply doesn't apply to them.   They do however as I pointed out have to comply with the other provisions.   They do have to do what (c) requires, which is when Reynolds moved from Missouri to Pennsylvania, he had to tell somebody.   That is what (c) requires; it's what he was required to do even before SORNA was enacted; and what Congress did with respect to the subset of sex offenders that haven't already registered before SORNA but that need to get on the registry -- afterwards, because, for example, their sex offense wasn't covered before SORNA.

So a person who has recently -- recently committed the crime, is in prison, is under an obligation to register, is yet not in violation because of the time for initially registration -- registering -- has not yet expired.   Now let's go back to a person who is far less certain how it applies.   He committed the crime 10 or 15 years ago.   He has long since been released from prison.   There are, as you point out, several categories.   One is a person who has to -- who should under Michigan State law register, but he didn't.   Another is a person who did, and moved.   You know, there are several categories.   Now, is he in violation of 2250?   Your point is he is immediately, even though it was much less clear that it applied to him, much less clear.   And much less clear -- in fact, it doesn't say when he is supposed to register, but still, 2250 applies to him.   I just wonder how that could be, particularly when we have three sentences, indeed, which seem to me to tell the Attorney General, certainly, please deal with that kind of a case.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --But you're suggesting, Ms. Sherry, that (b) and (c) have nothing to do with each other, and in fact, one can read (a), (b), and (c) as all integrally linked and referring only to postenactment offenders, so (a) is the umbrella provision; it says   \"a sex offender shall register and keep the registration current. \"   (B) says how you shall register initially, and (c) says how you shall keep that registration current.   So all three of these refer only to postenactment offenders.   And then (d) comes along and says, by the way, the Attorney General can apply all of this to pre-enactment offenders as well, and can specify how to do that. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " Again, I don't think that's right.   And if it helps, I'd like to walk through the different provisions.   The one thing I would say on the outset, however, is when you say that, when you read those sections, you can read them as applying to only postenactment offenders, I don't think that's right, especially because of subsection (b), because on the day that SORNA was enacted, every single person in prison at that time was be definition a pre-enactment offender, and so on its face when you read subsection (b), it quite easily applies to quite a number of pre-enactment offenders.   And the other point I would make along those lines is that fact subsection (b) just doesn't talk about pre-enactment, it talks about pre-implementation offenders.   So offenders that were convicted after SORNA's enactment but before SORNA was implemented, again quite easily fit not only within subsection (b) but within all the other subsections as well.   And with respect to the interrelationship between them, I think subsection (a) really identifies the jurisdiction in which a defendant needs to register.   So the first instance the jurisdictions in which an offender both needs to register and to keep the information current.   Subsection (b) really serves a limited purpose.   It's an intake process.   It's getting an offender into the system.   For offenders like Reynolds who are already in the very same system, there is nothing to be done.   (B) simply doesn't apply to them -- (B) is applied to people who are not already in that system, and for those that can comply with the timing, it gets them in before their release to the community.   But the inability to comply with subsection (b) for the small set of offenders that cannot comply were with the timing requirements, it doesn't immunize them from complying with all the other registries-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --In other words, you were reading (c) as saying, to go back to my example, the person who was convicted last year and has four more years to do his initial registration -- nonetheless, if he changes his name, if he stops being a student while in prison, he has to register tomorrow or the day after.   I would say if that's your reading of those two sections, it's going to confuse everybody who is in prison, as it did confuse me. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --That is not my reading of the-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Alright, then.   Then I take it your reading is he does not have to fulfill (c) until after he has to initially register, and so we're back to the question of why you treat somebody who committed the crime long ago with less clarity -- with less time to initially register, with more confusion from one jurisdiction to another than you would treat a person who was convicted last year, is still in jail, and has four more years to register.   That's why I read (d) as trying to sort that kind of thing out. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --Two points on that.   Number one, for offenders like Reynolds that are already registered, there's nothing more to be done as far as registration goes.   All that he needs to do is to keep the information current and to keep it updated.   The other point I would make, since we're talking about 2250, Congress provided other protections for offenders that were unable to comply with the timing requirements, number one -- it provided impossibility affirmative defense in 2250(b), and the other thing that Congress did is it required that any failure to register in order to be subject to prevailing sanctions, that it be a knowing failure to register.   In other words, that the offender know he has a registration requirement and know that he is not complying with that requirement.   So the idea that there are some hypothetical or maybe even not so hypothetical sex offenders out there who can't comply with the precise timing in (b) and will -- have no idea what they are required to do, they are not going to be criminally liable under 2250 because there is an impossibility defense.   And to the extent they don't know that they have a registrational requirement, they're also not going to be criminally liable under 2250.   And so-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Why isn't part of your answer to Justice Breyer's question that the one person who doesn't have to register for four years is in prison already, so presumably, he doesn't present the same type of threat that led to the enactment of these registration laws in the first place. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --That's absolutely right.   The reason -- the release from prison is the trigger and the concern and the reason we have registration is for periods of time where these offenders are released into the community.   And that's why the timing requirement in (b) is there.   The notion is that before offenders are released into the community, we want to get them on the registry rolls, we want to be able to track them from the day that they're released. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Your view is that they have to register initially when? "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " If they have not? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, no, I'm saying -- take my example.   The person is in Michigan.   Michigan does have a sex registration thing, but he never actually did, so now the Federal act comes in now when is he supposed to register.

"}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " Given the rest of the requirements something probably along the lines of give or take three business days. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Three business days he's supposed to go out and do that and if he doesn't do that he has committed a federal crime which makes no mention of it, no mention at all, and he's just supposed to guess that that's three business days because he's a lawyer, is that why? "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " No, actually it's not unique with respect to the statute, it's quite common for status offenses, and let me try to give one example.   One of the statutes that the Court looked at fairly recently 922 g 9 makes it unlawful to possess a fire arm after having a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.   That statute applied in 1996 and applies to everybody convicted of a domestic violence offense.   So if an individual had domestic violence conviction in 1990 and had a fire arm in his possession forever the last 20 years when the statute passed in 1996 he was in violation of the statute.   Of course he couldn't be prosecuted unless he was given some reasonable time to get rid of the fire arm.   But there is nothing years ago with respect to that.   And again, the criminal provision here 2250 provides additional protections it has an affirmative defers for impossibility and it requires that there be knowledge.   So for an offender that knows he is required to register he is given a reasonable amount of time to come into compliance with that registration requirement.   Reynolds in particular is an example of what Congress was trying to get at.   Reynolds knew he was required to tell somebody when he moved from Missouri to Pennsylvania.   He knew that because he signed registration forms in Missouri telling him as much.   And those are in the joint appendix after pages 16.

"}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " They were -- they were under Missouri law, but the important point for SORNA purposes is that he knew he had a registration requirement.   He doesn't have to know what law it arises under.   And again, the sex offender registries that pre-existed SORNA are the exact same sex offender registries that SORNA is using.   SORNA was enacted in 2006; it wasn't starting over; it wasn't starting from scratch.   wanted to build on the previous regime.

The registration requirement, violation of which can result in criminal penalties in certain circumstances; but again, Congress provided additional protections for those circumstances.

I think the Court doesn't give deference in those circumstances, but it certainly is within the scope of the general authority of an agency or the Attorney General in this case to reiterate the statute's requirement.   The Attorney General went -- went a step further in the interim rule in that what the Attorney General said in the preamble is I read the statute as written; I think it applies facially to all sex offenders regardless of the date of conviction but I understand the defendants are making an argument to the contrary, and in an abundance of caution to foreclose that argument to the extent I need to do something under subsection (d) I am doing it now; and I'm saying that yes, it applies to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation offenders.

I don't know if I have one in a criminal context exactly, but I think the point maybe that Your Honor's getting at; and you can certainly correct me if I'm wrong; might be a point that you made earlier.   It certainly is somewhat unusual delegation of authority to the Attorney General.   If Congress had wanted the Attorney General to decide whether or not the registration requirements at the very core of this statute had any operative effect going forward, presumably it would have told the Attorney General that he needed to do something.   That's something that Congress did in many other provisions of SORNA where Congress said the Attorney General shall do something.   In fact, more than a dozen provisions Congress used that language to direct the Attorney General to take a certain action. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, here it says shall.   It says the Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subsection. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " But it says shall have the authority.   And I think there is a significant difference between shall specify and shall have the authority to specify.   The latter is a passive delegation of authority; it's a permissive delegation.   It suggests that the Congress did not think that the Attorney General had to do something for the statute to apply as written.   It suggests that the statute applied on day 1 to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation offenders as all the other subsections that set forth the registration requirements suggest, but if the Attorney General in the future sees a need to specify the applicability going forward, then he has the authority to do that.   Not that he-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --But the question -- you are starting from a proposition, counsel, it seems to me, that Congress necessarily and under all circumstances thought that it had to include pre-SORNA convictions.   But I don't know -- yes, it wanted a uniform system, but it had State systems in place, it had an imperfect Wetterling Act in place.   It had lots of other mechanisms in place to punish non-registrants.   So you are starting from the proposition that by necessity they wanted to include preconviction felonies.   But I guess for those of us who believe in legislative history, and I know many of my colleagues don't believe in it or pay attention to it, there were two bills passed on SORNA, one a House bill that made it very clear, explicitly clear that it applied to pre-SORNA conviction felons; and the Senate bill which under the label Retroactivity had the terms that (d) now has.   Doesn't that suggest to us that Congress itself was unsure of whether it wanted to include the pre-SORNA convictions or not? "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --I don't think so, and for two reasons.   First, to address the bills themselves, I don't think the Senate bill, just like I don't think subsection (b) means that Congress meant to apply the registration requirements to all pre-enactment offenders in the registration provisions and then take away that provision in the specify the applicability provision.   In the Senate bill that you are talking about it defined a sex offender as anybody who has been convicted of a sex offense and as this Court said in Carr, that is the language that Congress quite often uses when it intends to include pre-enactment conduct.   So I think the verb choice, both in the Senate bill, in the House bill, and in the bill that was actually enacted, indicates that it did intend to include pre-enactment offenders.   The other point I would want to make is again, another point that was made in Carr, which is that the registration requirements stand at the very center of Congress's efforts to find and to register the 100,000 missing sex offenders that have fallen off the registry rolls under the previous regime.   So I think it is quite clear with respect to SORNA that Congress did want to include pre-enactment offenders; it wanted to not only find those missing sex offenders; it wanted to make sure that they got back on the registry rolls.   And as far as of the hundreds of thousands of offenders that were already on the registry rolls when SORNA was enacted, they wanted to make sure that they stayed on the registry rolls, that they kept the information current; they continued to update their information going forward.   And again, with respect to pre-enactment offenders that were in prison at the time that SORNA was enacted, it wanted to make sure to get them on the registry rolls before they left prison, before they-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I guess my problem is that you make an assumption, you continue to make an assumption that if the Attorney General hadn't acted -- that the Attorney General was incapable of acting quickly.   I mean, if the Attorney General had within a few months done what he ultimately did a year later or whatever time period after, had come out and said, it applies; this is what you do; briefly, you register wherever you were convicted or -- et cetera, if you move or change your name, then Congress would have accomplished the goal it wanted. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --If -- if the -- if Congress had wanted the Attorney General to act and to act quickly, presumably Congress would have told the Attorney General that he had to do something.   Again, that's something Congress did in many other provisions of SORNA.

"}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " Because when the Attorney General issued the interim rule, what he said was that reading it on the face, I do think it applies to everybody, but I recognize the defendants are making an alternative argument and I think it's incredibly important that it apply to everybody, and that it apply to everyone quickly, because we are talking about protecting our communities; we're talking about protecting the public and protecting our children from sex offenders, and having this uncertainty out there is -- is not only not good for protecting the public, but it's not good for sex offenders; it's not good for jurisdictions that are trying to work towards substantial implementation of SORNA.   And so I think you could look at it one of two ways.   If the idea is, well, Congress left it to the Attorney General, but the Attorney General sort of acted very quickly, I think that suggests that there probably wasn't that much for the Attorney General to do in the first place, and there is little reason that Congress would not have made that decision on its own.   To the extent you think there was a whole bunch of things for the Attorney General to do, which again we disagree with, presumably that is something that would take some time.   During the interim period those 100,000 sex offenders would remain missing; additional sex offenders would be added to that number and the community and public would continue to be at risk going forward.

"}, {"speaker": "Candace Cain", "text": " I would like to address one point the Government made, that there's no need to reregister -- someone in Mr. Reynolds' position -- once they have been registered under State law.   They acknowledge the opposite themselves in footnote 12, where they say that --   \"that a Government or a State will have been deemed to substantially implement SORNA if it registers pre-enactment and pre-implementation sex offenders who remain in the system as registrants, as well as other people. \"   So it's clear that the Government believes that -- acknowledges that people who are already registered must reregister under SORNA.   The most important thing is that this -- the SORNA statute -- the obligation under SORNA begins with initial registration, and does not begin with a State registration.   And enactment, Congress knew that certain people would be unable to register under subsection (b), and that is why they enacted subsection (d).   We ask the Court to remand to the district court, and to allow Mr. Reynolds to pursue his claim. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Counsel.   The case is submitted.
