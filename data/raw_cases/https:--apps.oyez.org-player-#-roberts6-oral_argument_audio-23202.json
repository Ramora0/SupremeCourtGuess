Fisher", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Local governments violate the in-writing requirement of Section 332 when they fail to issue a document separate from the administrative record that specifies the reasons for denying an application to construct a personal wireless facility.   Any other construction would flout the very purpose of this provision, which is to enable meaningful judicial review.   Indeed, allowing local governments to deny applications without specifying their reasons would require district courts across the country to embark-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's not actually what the court below said.

Fisher", "text": " --Justice Sotomayor, I'm not sure the Eleventh Circuit did actually specify what the reasons were.   It did pronounce that it believed that the administrative record contained reasons.   We don't deny that there are a bevy of potential reasons in the district courts -- I'm sorry, in the administrative record.   I counted nine or ten as I read the transcript and the minutes.   The problem is we don't know which one of those were the City's real reasons for denying the permit, and therefore, we can't have the expedited proceeding that Section 332 contemplates. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, how far does your argument go?   Suppose the -- suppose the instrument of denial, the letter, does not list any reasons, but it incorporates by reference or makes reference to some other document that sets out the reasons?   Is that sufficient? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " We think that if the denial letter clearly -- clearly directed us to some other document and said -- and said where the reasons were, and that document was contemporaneously available, we think that would be enough.   Now, neither of those things are present here.   There's no explicit reference to any particular reasons in the minutes.   It just simply says the reasons are available, and of course, as the Solicitor General has pointed out, the minutes were not available. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.

Suppose the letter doesn't make a specific reference to some other document, but there is some other document known to the parties that has been approved by the town council and sets out the reasons, that would not be sufficient.   There has to be an express reference in the instrument of denial. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Right.   I think the question is, what does the decision say?   That's the statutory term.   And so, the decision needs to provide the reasons.   Now, you could have a situation like the Omnipoint case in the Sixth Circuit where instead of getting a separate letter like we got in this case, you get a resolution from the city council specifying the reasons, and we think that would be enough as well.   All we want to know is why -- why the application was denied so that we can decide, first of all, whether to bring a suit or try to negotiate with the local government.   And second of all-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, that's not -- I'm sorry, go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But that's not all you want.   Let's say on Monday you get a letter that says your application is denied.   And on Friday the city council says the reasons we denied the application were because of this, this, and this.   Is that enough for you? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " No, it would not be enough-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --because the letter needs to tell us why.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It has to be in a single document.   What if it's stapled together?   You know, here's one, it says denied.   And here's one saying, the next day, the reasons we denied it is are these. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " I think stapled together would be just fine. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

No, we think that the statutory term is definition -- sorry, is decision, is a singular.   So it needs to be put together. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But decision -- decision, Mr. Fisher, often means just denied.   There -- there is one statute was mentioned in the brief at -- this is 47 U.S.C. 546 (c)(3),   \"The franchising authority shall issue a written decision. \"   That's one sentence.   Next sentence,   \"Such decision shall state the reasons therefore. \"   So the requirement of a decision alone doesn't necessitate that reasons be given. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, we think it's fine to look at other provisions of the Communications Act.   That one particular provision stands apart from the several other provisions that the Chamber of Commerce cited around page 10 of its brief and that we cite in our brief where the word \u201c decision \u201d is used by itself and in context clearly to mean a specification of reasons.   Where the Communications Act contemplates no statement of reasons, it uses words like \u201c notify \u201d or \u201c order \u201d.   And so we think it's perfectly fine to look at the whole Act.   That one provision is the only countervailing piece of evidence. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Your bottom line is because of this supposed default, you get your -- your application is granted, and that seems odd when the thrust of this arrangement is that the decision should be in the hands of the local governing board or the local council or something.   And then to say because of the procedural lapse, then you emerge the winner and it doesn't matter what good reasons the town might have had. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Well, there's two important things about that, Justice Ginsburg.   First is the ordinary remedy is an injunction.   We think that's the ordinary remedy.   That's an equitable remedy that, of course, isn't absolute.   And the second reason is, is why that's the remedy.   Remember, the whole purpose of this Act is to defeat local intransigents.   In other words, process is the problem, not the solution.   So simply requiring additional process, additional time, additional reasons, that's exactly what the Act is designed to solve, that problem that existed before 1996. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, I suppose that could be left up to the district court on remand. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Of course, Justice Kennedy.   The Eleventh Circuit didn't reach the remedy question. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Let me ask you, I think we would have a much different case if at the time of the written notice, they appended the official copy of the transcript.   Is the problem here that the transcript was too late? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " That's one problem, but it's not the only problem. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Because it seems to me you don't make the lateness part -- you don't make the lateness argument that the government makes in your 22 in your question presented.   You do say that there has to be a -- whether documents stating the application has been denied but providing no reasons.   So I suppose we can imply from that that you think that the later copy of the transcript is -- is just not applicable. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " That's right, Justice Kennedy.   We think that's one problem, but it's not the only problem.   Even if the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But do you I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --Even if the transcript had been attached, there still wouldn't have been, based on this letter, a specification of reasons.   And I'd be happy to walk the Court through exactly why that's so if you have a question. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, before you do so, why is the transcript required?   They had minutes that summarized the testimony.   Your position is not that the transcript had to be attached. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " No, it's not.   I think Justice Kennedy asked me if the transcript had been attached, and so I was saying that -- taking -- taking that question as as I got it. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But if the -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " The minutes would be enough-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I may not have followed this.   If the transcript were attached, what? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --Then that would not be enough on its own-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Oh, okay. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --because the letter would still need to tell us where in the transcript the reasons were.   And I'd like to walk the Court through-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Fisher, you're deriving all this from the word \u201c decision \u201d and \u201c decision \u201d as even the dictionary you principally cite, Blacks Law Dictionary states, \u201c decision \u201d, you know, can mean one of two things.   It can mean an opinion or it can mean a judgment, and people refer to -- it use that word to refer to either.   So why should we interpret it your way? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --For two reasons, Justice Kagan.   One is because the overall context of the Act and the substantial evidence review requirement and the overall purpose tell us that \u201c decision \u201d needs to specify reasons.   You can't conduct substantial evidence review until you know what the reasons are. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, that only suggests that you need reasons.   It doesn't suggest that the reasons have to appear in a decision as opposed to some other document. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Fair enough.   So one other part of the Act, which is the expedited review provision, I think, also is instructive.   The idea that Congress had in mind was that parties could show up in a district court and go straight to the question whether evidence in the record supported the city's decision.   Congress did not contemplate what we would have under the City's approach or even the Solicitor General's approach, which is an entire first phase of litigation devoted to figuring out what those reasons are. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But the larger problem here, of course, is that under your view, the Federal statute says that a local legislative body has to act like an administrative agency, and that raises very serious concern under Federalism.   In the in the law of zoning, generally -- forget this Act -- in the law of zoning generally, if you go to the board of supervisors and want to rezone the property from agriculture to multifamily residential, do we say that due process requires them to give some reason?   Is there anything in the law of zoning generally that says you have to give reasons? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " I don't think generally.   If there were a liberty interest or a property interest at stake-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It would be like Goldberg v. Kelley for-- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --Right.   And we cite in our brief the Wolff v. McDonnell case, which says that when liberty or property interests are at stake, minimal due process requires a specification of reasons.   And it's not the only time that cities provide specifications of reasons.   They do it on their own.   If you look at J (a)(84) and if you look at Footnote 4 of our reply brief, we cite numerous instances where the city takes it upon itself already to provide reasons for denials of permits.   They do it-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Fisher, could you explain how you are disadvantaged?   Now, first of all, what happens on remand to the district court in your view?   The Eleventh Circuit rendered its decision, the case is remanded, what happens on remand? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --Well, as the case stands now, we prevailed in the district court and the district court gave us an injunction allowing the site to be constructed.   The city took an appeal to the Eleventh Circuit which reversed on the question of whether the Act was violated.   So I think what would happen, after this Court rules, it would go back to the Eleventh Circuit with the case in that -- in that posture.   If I could say a couple more things about-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Then what would -- then if this Court should uphold the Eleventh Circuit, then what happens? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --If you uphold the Eleventh Circuit, then we go back down to the district court and are going to-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And what happens there? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --And I think there we're going to have to have one of these prolonged proceedings to decide what -- first of all, what the reasons are.   The city has already filed one brief in the district court, before this case started to go up on appeal, where it took the position that there were three reasons for its denial: Property values, the fact that T-Mobile allegedly already had sufficient service in the area, and compatibility with the neighborhood.   The city, in this Court, has offered some different reasons.   The Solicitor General offers a still different take on the transcript and the minutes.   And so, first we have to have in the district court one of these first mini hearings that I've been describing.   And then we would, perhaps, then be able to litigate the question Congress contemplated, which is substantial evidence followed by some other arguments we might make. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Fisher, assume, and just for the sake of argument, that we do say that a separate writing that clearly sets forth or sets forth the reasons for denial is adequate.   I understand you to say that this is not adequate because it's not clear presumably; am I correct? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Under this board's rules, do -- I'm assuming the board has to be unanimous, majoritarian voting rules, but why does every council member have to have the same reason?   Can't different people say no for different reasons? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " I think, Justice Sotomayor, they might be able to.   The ordinary course would be a letter that provides reasons that speak for the entire council.   But I wouldn't deem it impossible for a letter to come to us that says two city council members voted to deny the application for this reason and two others voted to deny the application for another reason.   We can still use that to go into district court and the district court could still do its job. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Oh.   So your-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But you say you can't use it in this case.   You say that that factor renders the -- the giving of reasons inadequate. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " No, Justice Scalia, it's not just the multiplicity of people on the board stating different things.   It's the fact that we don't know whether those statements constitute reasons.   And this is one thing I really would love to give you a couple of examples.   There are many problems, first of all, arising out of the first question whether or not what citizens and experts say can constitute reasons.   The Solicitor General says: Well, there has to be a clear indication that the voting members agree with that.   Well, what if somebody just says, that's a good point, we'll take it into consideration?   Or, thanks, you know, I'll -- I'll think about that?   What about the fact that a member, him or herself, might say something with an equivocal tone.   For example, Dr. Price said: I'm not sure how to assess property values here. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, doesn't that-- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Does that count as a reason? "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --All of these kinds of examples, don't they only suggest that a State or a locality would be well advised to write up a little paragraph that clearly states its reasons?   But, you know, if they want to take the risk that a district court is going to say, gosh, I just can't find the reasons in this record, it's all too muddled.   If they want to take that risk, what in the statute prevents it? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " The nature of substantial evidence review, which has a limiting principle-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " No.   But I mean, substantial evidence review requires reasons.   If they want to take the risk that their that their minutes or their transcript will not allow the district court to do substantial evidence review, then, you know, they'll lose. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --But, Justice Kagan, substantial evidence review requires them to defend only on their actual reasons.   And what the city wants to do is have a record of over a hundred pages where anything it can find a foothold in, the lawyers can come in and make an argument that that's why they denied something.   That not only frustrates process, but even, Justice Kennedy, to your question about Federalism, it starts to frustrate Federalism, because now Federal courts are deciding why local government -- local governments-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, I'm surprised that -- that you're willing to accept that there does not have to be a reason or a number of reasons that -- that the city council agrees on, that, you know, seven members of the city council, each -- each one of them has a different reason, and that's okay.   Do you think that that's what the statute means? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --Well, I'm not sure, Justice Kennedy -- Justice Scalia.   It -- you don't have to decide that in this case.   The Solicitor General reserves it in a footnote.   I'm not sure that just like this voting body can reach a decision without a single reason -- you know, these local government boards I think are really acting in an adjudicatory posture here, so I wouldn't want to preclude that. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes.   But one can interpret the statute as demanding that they have a reason.   Now, to be sure, that's contrary to normal legislative action.   Congress doesn't have to have a particular reason for a statute.   Every every congressman can have a different reason, and it's still valid.   But I -- I would read this as saying the city needs to -- when it denies, it has to have a reason for denying.   I don't -- I don't know how else you read it. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " I certainly won't argue with that. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, then what's the disagreement?   I mean, what's the disagreement between you and the Solicitor General?   Justice Brandeis said years ago, which I thought was a great statement of law which doesn't ordinarily appear: Before we can say whether an agency decision is right or wrong, we have to understand what it means. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You get some piece of paper, you can't figure out what it means, well, then they'll send it back or they say no.   That's what judges do with administrative agencies all the time.   Your question says, do they have to have reasons?   Yeah.   Their question says can it appear in a separate document?   Why not, as long as the document is given about the same time?   So what's the problem? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " The problem -- we do agree with the Solicitor General, you need reasons.   We also agree with the Solicitor General that they need to be clear.   Where we part ways with the Solicitor General is on the proposition that the ordinary administrative record can meet that clarity standard. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't.   It depends on what it says. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Well, let me -- let me just talk about the record in this case, Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But that's the -- I know.   You want -- that's what you really want to say.   You want to say the record here isn't good enough.   But it seems to me that the one thing we're not deciding is whether the record here is good enough.   Rather, the questions have been put to us in general terms; we can answer them in general terms.   We probably even might be able to write an opinion in three paragraphs, clear. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " What I want to use is the record here to be illustrative, Justice Breyer.   There's nothing unusual about this record in the sense that-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Ah, yes.   But to do that, I would have to know quite a lot, wouldn't I, about -- about the situation of your client, about the situation of the city council, about what was actually meant by what they said about the context.   You understand the problem. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --Well, let me -- let me just give you a few examples.   At JA 336, 338, and 340 are the parts of the minutes that the city and the Solicitor General rely on.   And they say things, for example, in equivocal ways, as I was describing.   We don't know whether that was a reason.   We also have a temporal problem that arises sometimes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " As I understand the SG's position, the SG says there were five members of the council, three of them talked about the incompatibility of this tower with the neighborhood.   So what in that statement do you contest? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " That statement is-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Do you think that three of them did not base this on the incompatibility of the fake tree with the neighborhood? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " --I'm not a hundred percent certain they did, because the motion, as is set forth in JA 340, comes after all of those statements.   There are many other statements, Justice Kagan.   One -- one -- one council member said: I don't think cell towers should ever be able to be built in a residential neighborhood.   Another asked whether T-Mobile could use different technology to establish the cell site.   So we don't know whether these statements, which also were right around the same time, also are things the city could defend on.   And I'm not sure the Solicitor General even has taken a position as to whether or not there are any other reasons in the record.   The Solicitor General has told us there's one thing we can consider. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The Solicitor General only needs one. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Well, no.   They don't necessarily need one, Justice Kagan, because in the district court we're going to challenge for substantial evidence those reasons.   So it's going to be very important if in the district court we can show, as we think we can, that substantial evidence does not support the city's incompatibility argument.   Then the question is going to be is there another reason in the record, and we haven't -- we have, perhaps, conflicting answers from the -- from the other two lawyers in the room today. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, then you're going to reach the question that Justice Scalia had a view of, which was, you know, if two people think X and two people think Y and one person thinks Z, is that sufficient?

Fisher", "text": " It's not sufficient because we can't guarantee that that is why they voted.   These are statements that come before a vote.   And just like in this oral argument today, there's going to be many concerns and questions that precede the vote.   The vote may be for a different reason.   You don't know -- I'd like to think that every answer I give today is going to assuage any question that I get, but that's not necessarily the case.   And it's not necessarily the case that something a local council person says for a round of applause in the room is exactly why they're going to vote 10 minutes later on the application.

"}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   It's our position that a local government must provide reasons when it denies permission to construct a cell tower so that a court can conduct substantial evidence review as contemplated by the statute, but those reasons don't necessarily need to be included in the same document as the city's written denial of the application.   It's fine for the city to give its reasons in some other document like meeting minutes.   If the local government relies on a separate document, that document must be available at the time the written decision is issued. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Where does that come from?   There's nothing -- Ms. O'Connell, there's nothing in the statute that says that the decision doesn't have to have the reasons, something has to have the reasons.   It has to be, you say, fairly contemporaneous.   I don't see anything -- you -- you are inserting something into the statute that is not there. "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " The -- the primary reason why we're saying it has to come out at the same time is because otherwise it would frustrate the judicial review provision, where the applicant has 30 days under the statute to decide what action to take based on the denial.

I don't know why you have chosen a route that would say this applicant wins automatically, no hearing, no nothing.   It doesn't matter that town's council had good reasons for it, they weren't contemporaneous, that's the end of it. "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " I think one reason why, Justice Ginsburg, is because it's difficult to read the statute that way.   The 30 days runs from the final action of the local government, and the local government has to issue a decision in writing.   It would be difficult to say once you have a letter in hand that says, dear applicant, your application has been denied, that you don't have a written decision.   The applicant would be left to wonder whether reasons are coming at all, and if so, what those reasons are going to be.   And I think if you follow that to its logical conclusion, if -- if you didn't have reasons and didn't know if they were coming, I guess what you would do, then, is wait 150 days from the day you filed your application and then file a lawsuit saying, they didn't act on my application in a reasonable time, which seems not correct, given that they sent-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

There are five votes.   One person says I'm denying because we don't need the gas; a second person says I'm denying because it's ugly; a third person says I'm denying because it blocks certain animals from getting to their feeding place; and the other two vote to grant, all right?   That's arisen in the course of the last 100 years, something like that.   How do the courts handle that?

In -- in the cases we describe in footnote 6, some courts have said and the D.C. Circuit did assume in one case that we cited that you need a majority, but other courts have said that it's okay as long as if everybody gives a different rationale, as long as you can get to a majority; you can conduct substantial evidence review of each of those rationales.

Because, as this Court has referred to it and other courts have referred to it, this whole telecommunications jurisprudence across the country is a patchwork, and in this particular instance, there are jurisdictions that don't require any notification, there are jurisdictions that require something be entered on the minutes, there are jurisdictions that require a letter, there are jurisdictions that require a certified letter.

That's what this means to me.   Now, your clients and others aren't used to being agencies, but they're being treated like agencies and, therefore, the simplest thing is to read this two things together, just what Justice Kagan said, write the decision and give your reasons because otherwise there is no way to know whether there's substantial evidence or not.   It's in the same clause.   It's in the same phrase.   The words are right there.   It says \u201c decision supported by substantial evidence \u201d.   I know -- that's, I think, the basic argument.

Number one, the amicus brief that was filed on behalf of the City of Roswell basically lays out the fact that you are exactly correct, there are lots of municipalities and local governments throughout this country that have trouble dealing with a pretty sophisticated Federal statute.   The City of Roswell has a relative degree of sophistication, it has attorneys, and it has planners and can do that.   But no court has ever held, including this Court, that the Chenery-type analysis for what needs to be an administrative decision has an application to a local government.   If you look, for instance, that -- that -- there is lots of argument from Petitioner that there's something wrong with what Roswell did.   And if you just look at, specifically, they had evidence in the record, they had people who said this, this, this, this, and this.

In other words, given that nobody in small local governments has access to great lawyers or knows a lot about communication, that we should just set up a rule that enables them to comply simply.   And that rule, honestly, would be Mr. Fisher's rule.   It would just say, in your decision, write a sentence or two saying why.   Because otherwise, if we don't have that rule and every judge has to look through the minutes and the transcript and anything else in the record to decide whether a reason is clear enough, there are going to be a lot of local governments that are going to get kind of caught, and the judge is going to say, I'm sorry, it's not clear enough, even though if the government had spent just five minutes, it could have made it clear enough.

"}, {"speaker": "Richard A. Carothers", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, I don't know how to answer that.   I don't know of a jurisdiction that does not have some form of minutes or ratification of the previous actions and discussions they've taken, which are generally approved at the next meeting.   I think, in fact, if they're going to have substantial evidence in the written record, whenever those minutes are approved, they had better get into doing minutes because that is what's going to be required. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why -- why do we have to say?   Why don't we take word for word almost what the -- what the court said?   What this statute requires is that there be a written denial -- well, we can forget whether it's separate or not -- describing the reasons for the denial and containing a sufficient explanation to permit the court to evaluate the evidence, period.   Now, that's what the city has to do.   And if they produce something that's a mess because it's a 98-page thing of minutes and the court can't figure out what it is, you'll get a decision like this.   If, in fact, somebody summarizes at the beginning, these are the reasons that we have denied and therefore we do deny it, it won't be a problem. "}, {"speaker": "Richard A. Carothers", "text": " Well, Justice Breyer, I simply would argue that the minutes have to have substantial evidence, which is -- or have to have the reasons, which is supported by the substantial evidence.   And if the court can't discern what those are, they're not going to survive the substantial evidence test.

"}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " There's no requirement of a notification letter, whatever.

"}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I'm taking it as it's written.   You're making up a denial letter.   There's -- there's no requirement of a denial letter.

And, Justice Scalia, to the extent we're talking about the same thing, I believe that the decision from when the time should run is, in fact, that approval of the minutes, which has the reasons based upon the substantial record.   I don't see that that, whether it's a denial, whether it's a notification, whatever it is, it doesn't have to have reasons.   So really, it doesn't help the applicant and doesn't help the city, but we're trying to give the words in the statute some effect.   We do not want to give them the effect that it is a decision and glorify something because a decision can be no. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Everybody else like you thinks that there has to be a denial letter, right?

Carothers", "text": " Justice Kennedy, I'm struggling to answer that question because we didn't get very far in the district court.   We never really got a chance to talk about substantial evidence because the court decided: I'm not going to reach that prong of (B)(iii); I'm going to say that I can't understand -- excuse me.   Thank you very much. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " Thank you.   I would like to make a point about our rule and then turn to the practicalities.   First, to -- to -- I think that what came before me helped under -- helped explain why a separate letter specifying the reasons for denial is not only required by the statute, but is the only way to make it work.   If you look at the minutes that the city issued here, and they're in the back of the Joint Appendix -- remember, as I think it's been noted, cities don't have to issue minutes, and so you're not always going to have minutes.   But on the theory that the minutes here would have been enough, look at the minutes, and if you want to look later at J.A. 338, J.A. 336, and J.A. 340, there are some of the reasons, as the Solicitor General put it, potential reasons, offered by various council members before the vote.   But if you look at J.A. 340, you'll see that all of those are separated from the motion, so the motion doesn't incorporate any of the reasons, not even what Dr. Price said before she made her motion.   So imagine yourself a district judge getting this set of minutes.   You don't know what the city's reasons were for denying the permit, and that's the problem that T-Mobile has and that's the problem the district judges have.   And I want to turn to Justice Alito's question -- and, Justice Kennedy, I think you also asked about the Federalism implications for local governments.   First of all, let me start with the City of Roswell.   The City of Roswell's own code, and this is at J.A. 84, requires it to give a separate document with reasons if it denies an application to construct a cell site on city-owned property.   All we're asking the city to do is do what it already does with respect to applications for city-owned property.   Now, you also point out there are rural areas in the country that have smaller staffs and jurisdictions.   At -- at page 13 of our reply brief we cite statutes from other States like New Hampshire, Nevada, Idaho, that already have as a matter of State law the rule that we pronounce -- I'm sorry, the rule that we propose.   The rural jurisdictions in those States don't seem to have difficulty doing it, and I think the reason why is because, as has been said a few times today, it just requires a few sentences usually.   Just tell us what the reasons are and tell the district court what the reasons are, so that when we get into court we can have the streamlined proceeding that Congress imagined, and that it can be done, as the statute itself requires, on an expedited basis.   That's all we're asking for today, and we think that any other rule is going to create problems at the lower -- I'm sorry, before you ever get to court and even more problems once we get to court. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Fisher, suppose that I think that you're right about that, but then the question is did Congress require that.   And I take it that the SG is really saying, no, Congress required reasons, it required that by saying that there was substantial evidence review, but that it didn't require the reasons to be in any particular form, and, indeed, there's a savings clause which says that all doubts go to the State and local governments in this area.   So notwithstanding that this is going to actually get State and local governments into some trouble, and notwithstanding that district courts are going to struggle with it, we should go with the SG's rule rather than with yours. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey L. Fisher", "text": " We think the best reading of sub (iii) is that Congress actually did require this.   As the city itself pointed out, it separates the notion of a decision in writing from whether it has substantial evidence in the record that supports it.   So when you ask what the decision in writing is, you need -- we think the best reading of that is that's the reasons.   The reasons have to be supported by substantial evidence, and you can't ask the substantial evidence question until you know what the reasons are.   And I think also, for the other reasons that we've pointed out and the Chamber of Commerce pointed out, how the Communications Act uses the word \u201c decision \u201d in a particular way.   It uses the word \u201c decision \u201d in other statutes to signify that an explanation is -- is something embedded in that, not as -- as -- as is often the case, and the city itself characterized the denial letter today, I think aptly, as a notification.   Well, the Communications Act uses the words \u201c notify \u201d and \u201c notification \u201d to refer to other kinds of advisements that need to be given.   That's not the word Congress chose here.   So, Justice Kagan, I agree, but if you look at this statute you might wonder to yourself if you misread the words in a vacuum which are -- which rule comes out of it, ours or the SG's.   But we know from City of Arlington, as this Court said, that the limitations in sub (iii) are limitations that Congress did intend to impose and the best reading of those limitations are the ones that we have given.
