[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-481, the Food Marketing Institute versus the Argus Leader -- versus Argus Leader Media. Mr. Young. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before I turn to why the Court should jettison the National Parks definition of \"confidential\" and instead restore that word's plain meaning as used in Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, let me address justiciability.   Respondent's brief expressed doubts about redressability, but redressability and the other two requirements of Article III standing are established here. First, our injury in fact is the disclosure of our members' store-level sales information that they keep secret. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Not if the government decides that it doesn't want to give it.   We already have a case that says, if the government voluntarily chooses to disclose, you're stuck; you can't appeal. So, here, the government chose not to appeal.   It chose, by definition, to turn it over.   Why aren't you bound by that decision? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " We're not bound for it because the intervention that we successfully moved in the District of South Dakota made us a proper party.   We have an interest that allowed us to intervene. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But the -- if you had been a part of the -- if you had been the original asker, we have a case that says -- Crystal City -- that if the government chooses to turn it over, you can't appeal. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " And the government did not make that choice.   So there are really five things. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, but they haven't made the choice on this exemption. They've made the choice because of a new law. Isn't the proper course for them to go back to the district court with a motion for reconsideration or for them to petition the court or for you to go to the court or for -- or -- or for someone else to go to the court and say they have to turn it over? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " No, Your Honor.   The government in this case made a number of steps that make clear that our redressability is not only likely but certain.   And let me start because standing at the time -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, it's not certain until the district court relieves them of the earlier judgment, telling them that Exemption 3 didn't apply. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, that -- that premise, I think, is -- is a mistaken one.   And if you look at pages 30 to 31 of the government's brief, for example, they make clear that they are not pressing an Exemption 3 argument here.   They are not requiring this Court or even asking this Court to reconsider the Section 2018(c) argument, on which the Eighth Circuit's first judgment -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But that's the basis for their refusal to turn it over now. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, no, the -- the basis for -- for their refusal to turn it over now is an Exemption 4 basis, that the information -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, they can speak for themselves, but I thought -- "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Agreed. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- when they chose not to appeal, they chose not -- they chose to follow the order of the court to turn it over. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " There are a number of things that differentiate this from a situation like that.   For example, instead of voluntarily disclosing it, which would be what they would do if they decided to follow it, they facilitated our intervention by alerting us to the possibility of judicial intervention. They then, when we did intervene, told the district court, they told the federal court, as they've told this Court, we will not release that information unless a final judgment in the judicial system requires it. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Do you understand the government to be firmly committed to not releasing the information unless required to? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Yes, that's what I understand. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I noticed them on your -- your side of the lectern. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " And I won't speak for them, but that's what they have represented not only to the district court but to this Court. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Now, of course, they remain free to change their mind. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " And that would be a -- a -- a different situation, but the question for standing at the time when we invoked the appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts was would we have a likelihood of relief, and the answer is yes. And, right now, based on the Solicitor General's brief, that was the thing that my friend on the other side invoked in his brief to this Court.   That would be a mootness question.   And, of course, mootness can be established only if it's impossible that this Court's reversal would give us meaningful relief. The opposite is true.   If this Court reverses, the only thing that will lead to our information certainly being made public will be destroyed.   And that's why all the requirements of Article III standing are met -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But it won't be destroyed because they have a 2018(c) argument. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, the fact, as in Milner, in which there was an Exemption 7 argument pending, this Court took it to decide Exemption 2.   Sure, there's a 2018(c) argument that, in theory, would be pending if this Court were not persuaded by anything we say, there's been an intervening change in the law -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If they're wrong on 2018(c), they have to comply with the extant judgment under Exemption 4? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " No, I -- I disagree, and I will allow my friend from the government to explain their position.   But they're making an Exemption 4 argument based on the -- the -- what they say in part B.2 of their brief. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They're trying to piggyback their appeal on you. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " No, I -- I disagree with that as well, Justice Sotomayor.   I think what the government is saying is we've had four decades of the highest level promise of confidentiality that the government can make to its citizens, and that is that this kind of confidential information, we will protect the confidentiality of it. And for that reason, even if the motivation that they had back in 1979 for starting down that process turns out to be wrong, nonetheless, the promise of confidentiality, which Exemption 4 and not Exemption 3 protects, remains. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Young -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But wasn't the whole purpose of -- FOIA says disclose, and one of the concerns was the government official, for one reason or another, doesn't want to disclose.   There have been cases of a captive agency, for example. So, to -- to say the government can control this by making a promise that it won't disclose, that seems to run counter to the whole idea of FOIA. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, it would perhaps run counter to the idea of FOIA if it were the kind of information that were -- was about the government's own doings or even, conceivably, something that's not presented here, if there were willy-nilly ad hoc promises of confidentiality in which low-level employees could wave a wand and say confidential, confidential, but I think that what this Court has repeatedly said -- I'll mention the Department of Justice versus the Reporters Committee case, where the Court says: \"Yes, FOIA's basic policy focuses on the citizens' right to be informed about what their government is up to.\" That's a direct quote. But then the Court immediately says that purpose, however, is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that has accumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency's own conduct. And so, here, what we see is a choice. When a SNAP beneficiary receives an allocation from the government, their choice to shop at this grocery store rather than one across the street is in no sense government action.   It is the unmediated decision of third parties. It tells you, in other words, an awful lot about Mrs. Smith or Mr. Jones and their choices, and it tells you a lot about how those two grocery stores market and -- and -- and sell and what their selection might be. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I don't doubt that you're heard.   I -- I -- I -- I do -- I can't quite figure out how this mootness thing works. It seems to me there are two laws, A and B.   All right? A is the -- the one you're interested in, and B is this other one that stops them from -- maybe -- from giving out information. Now, here, you're attacking A, so I'm asking, does A cause you injury? Not does B cause you injury.   Now, if B stops them from giving out the information, if you win on A, you don't get it.   If you lose on A, you don't get it. If B doesn't stop them from giving out information, if you win on A, you get it.   If you don't -- see, it works -- the -- the -- the result is the same no matter how we decide your case.   We just don't know about B. Now have I got that right? And if I -- if I've got that right, I -- I don't know a standing case right in point or a mootness case right in point.   I'm not sure what to do. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well -- well, if I'm understanding you, Justice Breyer, I -- I don't think it raises either one of those justiciability questions because the Court can have in reserve many grounds that the lower courts, for example, may not have addressed. In Milner, I mentioned Exemption 7 was still there.   Now, if Exemption 7 was well taken, Exemption 2 wouldn't have been necessary.   The Court granted in Milner to resolve what Exemption 2 meant, and it granted in this case to resolve what Exemption 4 means. And if you do it and you reverse -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The problem with that in Milner is -- and the big difference is that the government chose not to appeal the ruling on Exemption 4, so it acceded to turning it over under that exemption.   And under Crystal City, we said they -- you -- they or you can't appeal that. And you admit if that was all of it and they had chosen to turn it over, you would get it. So now the question is can they -- and they and you do an end-run around Crystal City by simply saying, no, we're really not going to turn it over because of something else, but we really didn't want to challenge Exemption 4 at all and we were going to turn it over because we didn't really think the pricing information was confidential back then. But now we think we're going to change our mind -- this is how I'm reading the argument -- and so we're going to piggyback on a private entity raising an issue that we should have appealed on. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, I don't believe the government's piggybacking at all. They're here as an amicus.   And it is we, the Food Marketing Institute -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But why -- why can you, without getting stuck in Crystal City? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, because -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Just because they've said I won't turn it over, but they're bound to turn it over right now by a judgment below, and they haven't asked the court below to reconsider that judgment. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " I -- I -- I think it's as simple as -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They raised Exemption 3.   They lost.   A change of law has happened.   They should have moved for reconsideration, and they didn't. So why aren't they stuck? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Because we intervened, and the opportunity to conclude that we are not a proper party to be able to make any of these merits inquiries has long since passed. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Young, may I ask you a question about your substantive standard? You at some points in your brief say that the question is simply whether the information is private, private being a synonym for confidential.   At other points in your brief, you talk about whether the information is kept private. To me, those two things are a little bit different, that the idea of keeping something private is not just that the information isn't out there in the world but that you're doing something to make sure that the information doesn't get out there in the world. So which do you think is the right approach in this case? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " I'll -- I'll readily agree with the latter.   Our -- our argument is not that simply marking something or stamping it confidential does the trick. We've had 27 years with the D.C. Circuit's critical mass case, which essentially adopts the position that we think correctly defines the entirety of Exemption 4. And in critical mass cases, when a party wants the release of some information that a party like us might say that's our confidential commercial information, more is required and you can be held to fail your Exemption 4 argument if you don't illustrate how you protect the information. So, for example, what is relevant and what was asked even in this very case, in -- in which these questions were presented to the trial court, do you bind it with nondisclosure agreements? Do you have security in place so that it limits the number of people even internally who have access to it? How do you make sure that it is not supplied accidentally in litigation, for example? How, in other words, do you make sure that it doesn't become public? Have you made sure that comparable information has not been made public in other forums? And so there are critical mass cases, decisions from the D.C. Circuit courts and from the Tenth Circuit courts that apply that, that look to those exact types of questions and say: Well, we can find something rather like this in publicly available information already.   Your Exemption 4 argument is gone. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how does that dovetail with the SG's position that if they ask you to turn over something confidentially -- and you seemed to be arguing that earlier -- that that's enough, that that makes it confidential? Because you've just said to me something quite different, which is it's not the government's request or promise to keep it confidential, but is it, in fact, kept in confidence the way you've defined it? So how do you dovetail the two? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, I would say that even if the government gives us a promise of confidentiality, that fits within the definition of what confidential is, we now have given something to the government in confidence, if we, nonetheless, publish it, if we're sloppy with it, if we release it in some other way, then we have breached the confidentiality ourselves. And I would argue that someone like that is no longer protected by -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " How about the -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So the government's overlay is really not necessary to this case? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " It's a manifestation of what confidential is. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Man -- but only a point of evidence, not a point that binds? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " I -- I guess.   I'm not sure what a point of evidence means. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Meaning, you say a manifestation, that a district court judge could look at that as among many factors. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Yes, I -- I would say that if the government in a proper form, if the government binds itself here through notice-and-comment rulemaking -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If you -- if you leave -- if you give this information to your employees, there's no promise of secrecy and -- "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, Landano defined what confidential meant also, and it recognized that confidential does not mean that nobody knows it.   It means that you have to keep it within a limited universe. Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the balance of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before I address the merits, I'd briefly like to address justiciability and be clear: The government will not release the disputed records from 2005 to 2010 if a FOIA exemption applies.   So long as the government is not judicially compelled to do so, it will not do so. Petitioner also had Article III standing.   That's evaluated at the time they filed the notice of appeal and invoked the appellate court's jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

Two, and then we go on to say, to release store-level redemption data collected after such a change.

There are some side questions like, is this exactly what the government is doing? How close is it? These types of nuances, I think, is what Petitioner may be relying on. We may have a small disagreement, but, ultimately, I think what we agree on is, in light of the 40 years of practice that has occurred here, all we're trying to do is live up to what this Court said in another FOIA case, CIA versus Sims, that great nations, like great men, should keep their word.   And the government is trying to keep its word, given over 40 years in the most official form possible, that we're going to keep this information confidential. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And this assurances point of yours, does it apply only when somebody is voluntarily giving information to the government, or might it apply when somebody is mandated to give information to the government?

Now you'd have to look to see whether the government would have authority to -- the agent -- the government official has -- have authority to make this assurance in a way that's objectively understood to be speaking for the agency, but it can apply potentially in both contexts. There are hard hypotheticals, I think, at some edges.   This case doesn't implicate any of them, so I think the Court could just simply cut through the -- through the -- the noise and -- and rule quite cleanly here.

Exemption 3 says Congress gets to choose what should not be disclosed. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That it's Congress's choice what the government will view as confidential and not disclose. Now you're bringing the government, the government qua the executive branch, into deciding what not to disclose under Exemption 4.   Doesn't that turn FOIA on its head? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " No, I think you -- if you read back a little bit in the statute, you'll see that Congress says that FOIA does not apply if any of the exemptions apply.   Exemption 3 is one of them.   It is one way, but it is an independent basis when Exemption 4 applies. And Exemption 4 is what we're talking about here.

Loeb", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the Court reaches the merits here, it should affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit.   For 45 years, the language of Exemption 4 has been properly construed to require a showing of likely competitive harm. Not only is that competitive harm standard fully supported by the common law that prevailed in 1966 when Exemption 4 was enacted, the standard has also been ratified by Congress for reasons that I'll explain. In 1974, the D.C. Circuit adopted the National Parks test with its two-prong test, including the competitive harm requirement. But, by 2001, there was a clear judicial construction. Eight circuits had adopted the same two-prong test as National Parks.   So, between 2001 and today, during those 18 years, Congress has enacted 29 statutes endorsing the language of and the provision of Exemption 4 and has -- and has effectively amended Exemption 4, thereby ratifying the National Parks standard. Now -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Loeb, this case strikes me as a lot like Milner, that you have a D.C. Circuit opinion which puts some things into the test that maybe the -- the statutory text does not immediately suggest.   And then there is -- everybody adopts it, you know? In Milner too, all the courts of appeals had adopted it.   Congress had let it remain on the books for quite some time without doing anything about it. Why isn't this the same thing as that, where we did say no, we're going to go with the text, not with this extrapolation? "}, {"speaker": "Robert M. Loeb", "text": " Context here is very different than Milner.   This Court in Milner expressly said there wasn't a judicial consensus supporting the D.C. Circuit's ruling. Also there, there weren't multiple statutes that -- here, we have 29 statutes, after the judicial consensus, enacted which effectively amend Exemption 4 -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " As to the -- "}, {"speaker": "Robert M. Loeb", "text": " -- and that certainly was not the case -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- as to the consensus, if I can stop you on that point, we're told by the other side that the circuits have been markedly inconsistent in the way they apply the test. So, if -- if -- if the D.C. Circuit had ruled one way and everybody said, yeah, this is how we do it, and the decisions all lined up, that would be one thing.   But, here, we're told that they will verbalize the same formulation, but they apply it differently. "}, {"speaker": "Robert M. Loeb", "text": " Well, I think the -- the key factor is they all adopt the same two-prong standard of National Parks.   And in any standard, how it's applied, even terms like fraud, which are well developed in the law, as it's applied to a particular circumstance, there's always going to be some deviation of the courts. But, ultimately, all the circuits who have addressed this issue have adopted the National Parks standard and, as to the competitive harm requirement, all require a showing of likely competitive harm. And that is the standard we're saying that is -- has been ratified here.   If you look at some of the statutes that we attach in our addendum, they are actually limiting the discretion that's under Exemption 4. So, as the SG's brief points out, Exemption 4 doesn't prohibit disclosure, it just says the agency has discretion whether to disclose or not. These additional statutes micromanage that discretion.   Some of them say that when you have the discretion, you have to withhold. Some say that when you have the discretion, you have to withhold for five years.   Some say when you have discretion, you have to ask the private party their view. Those are all -- those all could have been codified under Exemption 4, but, instead, they were codified under separate statutes. But that's just a matter of formalism.   This Court has said when -- when Congress actually examines a statute, amends a statute, and -- and reenacts it, that your -- that -- that Congress is presumed to have adopted the prevailing judicial construction. That's what this Court said in Lorillard, in Shapiro, and this term in Helsinn.   And, likewise, here, we have all the circuits lined up on the two-prong standards. We have Congress not just addressing the statute once but 29 times in this 18-year period where they, again, have codified over and over again that -- that -- that standard. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Loeb, along those lines, the other side makes the argument that, in Exemption 7, the word \"confidential\" is given a different gloss than you would have us give it in -- in Exemption 4. I'm sure you would like an opportunity to respond to that. "}, {"speaker": "Robert M. Loeb", "text": " Correct, Your Honor.   So, in looking at Exemption 4, you have to look at those words in -- in a -- a textual construction of it.   We'll begin by looking at the words and looking at how they were used in context at the time. And we know for Exemption 4, Congress started with a common law term, trade secrets, which even FMI agrees -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " That's another point.   I'd like to get to that too.   But, when we're dealing with the word \"confidential\", Justice Kagan made the point that perhaps there's a gloss that's been placed on it that might be inconsistent with what might appear to be its ordinary meaning. And that argument seems to me to have some strength, given the fact that Exemption 7 hasn't been treated by lower courts that bear the same gloss that you would have us put on Section -- on Exemption 4. And I'm just wondering, how do you deal with that incongruity textually? "}, {"speaker": "Robert M. Loeb", "text": " Right.   Well, first, let me admit we're not -- we -- we agree that the reading of the -- the word in Exemption 7 and Exemption 4 don't have the same import.   Let me explain why. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So why should we give the same word two different meanings when they're virtual neighbors? "}, {"speaker": "Robert M. Loeb", "text": " First, the commonality, that even under Exemption 7, this Court didn't turn to ask the confidential source, do you think that you had a confidential relationship? Instead, they looked for objective factors. And our -- our standard here is looking at an objective one, objective harm. Second, the fact that the same word is used in different provisions of the exemption doesn't answer it.   For example, trade secrets has the word \"secret\".   But, if you look at Exemption 1, it uses the word \"secret\" regarding national security matters. You wouldn't say the word \"secret\" regarding national security secrets has to be read the same as trade secrets because trade secrets has a common law meaning.   And that common law meaning -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I agree, secrets in the national security context might be different than they are in the trade secret context, but that's -- that's just not helping me with the word \"confidential\". So perhaps there's something particular about it, maybe there isn't.   I'll let you go on. "}, {"speaker": "Robert M. Loeb", "text": " No, no.   There's something particular about Exemption 7.   It talks about information that's -- information that is furnished under a basis of -- a confidential basis. So there, where Congress wanted to say it was furnished on a confidential basis, it knew how to say that.   That's not what it says under Exemption 4. Instead, we have Congress adopting these common law terms, trade secrets and related confidential commercial information, and when looking at those -- those words anew, you would -- you would look at how they were used in 1966 under the common law. And we know trade secrets required under the common law a showing of competitive harm.   And for the restatement, we know that this other second box of -- of confidential business information also required a showing of competitive harm. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So -- so what do you -- do you think? That is, what do you think about that? I mean, in reading some of these cases, it wasn't National Parks so much that I think caused the problem but other cases that sort of run with it.   That is, some say, well, the competitors have to use this in an affirmative way. I don't know where they got that out of the statute.   So would you be satisfied if we were to simply say: Well, they had the right idea there.   Confidential information is information that is legitimate for a confidential -- for a legitimate reason. It's confidential for a legitimate reason.   Release would hurt the company or release would hurt the government.   And then we add: And, of course, there has to be harm, I mean, business-related harm to the company. Now that would stop -- you know, I can imagine easily cases where there's information about who you sell to and who you don't sell to, and, of course, you want to keep that quiet because you give the impression that every sane person in the world buys your product.   And this would show that's not true. But we don't know whether people will take advantage of that or not, but they might. So it's harm, and it's legitimate.   Is that good enough in your opinion?

Where a plain language is, they just want to look at dictionaries, but even the dictionaries are ambiguous. But the common law tells you at the time that Congress chose the word \"trade secrets,\" which has a common law meaning which requires competitive harm.   And the restatement as well said there was a second category of business information and that it was treated the same way under the same standard and required competitive harm. So you look at the plain language there of trade secrets and financial and commercial information that's confidential, and understand that those were terms of art that were used in the common law, and these -- these words didn't fall from the sky and just randomly appear here.   They chose common law terms, trade secrets and the closely related commercial confidential information.   And the courts have used and the rules and the statutes have referred to those two bodies together.

You're -- you're clearly talking about that same second box of information, which has been protected by the common law and is being -- is being referred to here by the reference to commercial and financial confidential information.

Well, it -- it has to be obtained from a person and you look at whether there was harm to that -- that party who is -- who it was obtained from, which would be the -- the company or -- and if it -- but if it was information that pertained to the individual, it could perhaps be protected by other provisions, like the Privacy Act, to -- to -- to -- extends to a large degree of -- of information regarding a particular individual citizen, which is possessed by the government, which then shouldn't be disclosed. So there are other exemptions that cover information which goes to private information of an individual. Here, we're talking about commercial and financial information.   It was enacted together with trade secrets, both being common law terms, and it would be inappropriate to sort of expand it to a global confidentiality term. Here, you know, FMI is basically suggesting a unilateral approach to say as long as they treat it as secret and confidential, that this Court should fall in line as well. That would dramatically alter the scheme of FOIA, the one which -- Congress has reenacted Exemption 4 for 26 times, again and again after there was a -- a universal reading of this provision. First of all, FMI's counsel here says that this information isn't important, doesn't show what the government is up to. How the government spends its own money is critical information that the press and the public need to know.   It's the type of information that FOIA has been used for decades to reveal, you know, the Navy using -- spending $670 on toilet seats, to the bail-out funds being abused and wasted, et cetera, et cetera. We lay out examples in our brief. Under their test, that would -- could all now be claimed confidential by the parties saying, look, this reveals our side of the business.   Two sides of the coin.   You spend the money, we submit it.   We did the work.   We don't want you to reveal that.

But, as some earlier questions pointed out, if the government wants to seek relief on remand, if you rule for us and it goes back, they can go to the district court before the information is -- is disclosed and say we want to reopen the judgment based on a change of the law.   And we could litigate that here.   That's not something to be litigated in this Court, the meaning of 2018(c). So I don't think that -- that -- that with -- the Eighth Circuit was correct in how it read 2018(c), there was no -- no one's asking this Court to review that, and the new amendment doesn't alter how this Court should dispose of this case.

We're saying what has been uniformly adopted, at least since 2001, is the two-prong test.   One is to that first prong as to harm to the government, and the second prong is the competitive injury. So Congress has been well aware of that test, they had hearings about it, sought proposals.   And did they change the statute? That would be judicial acquiescence we're not relying on.

And then, if they take the language and reenact it or -- or put it from this statute to that statute, you would presume that they know the Supreme Court construction. But the language of Lorillard and Shapiro and Helsinn just talk about a uniform judicial construction.   And we know from Helsinn we had just the Federal Circuit construing the prior iteration, which was then lifted into the American Invents Act. So that principle is one really, does Congress know of that uniform construction, and did it do anything about it? And here we didn't have them just reenact something once or amend the statute once, but some -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So -- so, again, let's say we just had district courts, but we had uniform district courts saying 30 days means 50 days.   That's absolutely uniform. Congress thereafter says 30 days, everybody in America should know that that really means 50. The average person who's supposed to have fair notice of the statutes opens up the books and sees 30 days but, in fact, is supposed to know that it means 50 because a lot of district courts have said so?

"}, {"speaker": "Robert M. Loeb", "text": " Well, no one can argue that adopting the common law meaning of trade secrets and business information is a violation of due process.

Young", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Just a few points I'd like to make. First, to start with what \"confidential\" means and its relationship to any concept of harm. That question of harm asks a very different question.   It asks why someone keeps something secret, not whether they keep it secret.   There is no common law term of art called confidential business information or confidential commercial information. It's not -- that does not appear in the restatement.   It doesn't appear in the cases that are cited.   It doesn't appear in any scholarship.   And it wasn't something that either National Parks or any other case before or after it relied on to find some common law heritage. It's true, of course, that when one has a tort action, any kind of tort action, harm will be something that has to be shown, but that does not infuse harm into the very meaning of other elements of the tort. We know that from cases like Carter and Bruesewitz that even if there were some common law conception, it isn't enough for Congress to refer to some vague principle.   It would actually have to use that term of art. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, that -- that begs a question, which is we sort of naturally think that if people are going to keep something confidential, that there's a reason for it.   You don't just say, I don't want to disclose because I don't feel like it, although some people do. It seems to me that this concept that there has to be a reason for it and that it has to be tied to business and to commercial and financial matters, because that's the words, financial and confidential -- financial and commercial matters, those are the words of the statute, doesn't that naturally infuse the concept with some sense that there's a reason for keeping it a secret? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, I think it's likely that there is. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And that has to -- and -- and if there is some sense of it, why isn't that sense infused with a concept, if I let it out, it's going to hurt me? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, again, we think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Taking aside the quantum of hurt, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- there's a reason I keep it a secret. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " And I will address that as well.   But I think that in this very case it maybe is a good exemplar. Of course, our clients aren't paying for us to pursue this to this level because they just feel like it.   Of course, we think there's substantial competitive harm. But the question Congress asked is not for courts to engage in the prospective, speculative assessment -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But that's not true. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " -- of whether they think it is. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If -- if we read \"confidential\" as being confidential in nature, which is part of your definition -- "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " It's a manifestation of it. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, it's -- "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Things that are confidential in nature are likely to be kept secret.   Of course. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, that's the point, which is -- "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " But the founder of LifeLock put his Social Security number up on billboards all across the country to prove that his technology was so secure.   Now we wouldn't think that that is confidential anymore. It's just one manifestation of it. Everybody else's might be. And, here, when you -- when you have this bucket in Exemption 4, you start with it being commercial or financial.   Those are limits.   Of course, you're right, if you can't show that it's commercial or financial information, you're not within Exemption 4. Then you have to show it's obtained from a person.   That's not the government doing it, in other words. And then, lastly, it has to be confidential or privileged.   And all that Congress asked the courts to do is answer the objective question: Does the person whose information the government now has, does that person keep this secret and not publicly disclose it? And, if so, the fact, of course, that likely the reason they do that in many instances is to protect themselves from competitive harm, that's not something that courts need to spend two days on a trial with expert witnesses and leaders from industry and all different industry segments coming in to try to persuade a poor district judge to figure out why in the world this information would cause a substantial competitive harm or not. Harm is not part of the word confidential.   It's often associated with it if you -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But why not call it harm, some harm, I mean, some harm, because Congress doesn't go around protecting people from X where X doesn't cause any harm.   That would be not there in the statute, but it would be a general assumption. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, Congress spoke broadly -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Do you object to that, saying adding to that some harm? "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I -- I object to it in this sense: I think that by opening that door, you now are opening trial courts to have to do the kind of tedious and laborious work that leads to false negatives like this case. It -- it really is amazing that something like store-level SNAP redemption data would lead to a situation in which we had to have a trial at all.   And you wouldn't have to do it, and people aren't likely to press objections, if they don't have any harm that's going to befall them. And so Congress solved that problem by saying objectively -- if I might just finish the thought, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Evan A. Young", "text": " Objectively, if you have a pattern of keeping this information secret and not publicly disclosing it, that is the only thing the federal courts are authorized to ask, and that gives the government the authority to keep it secret if it so desires.
