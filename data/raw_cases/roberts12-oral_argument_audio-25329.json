[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 20-1641, Marietta Memorial Hospital Employee Health Benefit Plan versus DaVita, Incorporated. Mr. Kulewicz. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For four decades, the Medicare Secondary Payer Act has been a coordination of benefits statute.   It establishes that a group health plan must pay its benefits first during a 30-month coordination period when the plan and Medicare both cover an individual who must contend with end-stage renal disease. The plan must not take into account the Medicare entitlement or eligibility of an individual during that time or differentiate in the benefits that it provides between individuals with end-stage renal disease and other individuals covered by the plan on a basis that relates to that diagnosis. The Sixth Circuit has determined that there also is an implied mandate that dialysis providers occupy a specific position to be determined relative to providers who serve other vital healthcare needs of the 157 million American people who depend upon group health plans to defray the costs of their healthcare. When Congress requires a specific benefit or parity between benefits, it does so directly.   It did not do that here.   The Medicare Secondary Payer Act coordinates benefits.   It does not prescribe them.   The plan at issue in this case provides the same benefits uniformly to all participants and as primary payer during the 30-month coordination period. Respondents fail to state a claim under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act.   Because the alleged violations of the Medicare Secondary Payer Act are the express and only basis of their ERISA claims, Respondents also fail to state a claim under ERISA. The Court should reverse the Sixth Circuit and enter final judgment in favor of Petitioners on all remaining claims. I welcome the questions of the Court. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Doesn't your approach permit the differentiation or some differentiation between sort of high-cost services that are used by a certain segment of the population? I think that's the argument here, that you have a lot of people who are not in a good position to pay who are being charged at an amount that they're high usage, they're poor, and they can't pay the costs, and it seems as though your approach target that group. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Your Honor, the -- the approach that this plan takes is actually to minimize the actual out-of-pocket payment that the participants in any situation who are receiving dialysis will make. What this plan does by -- by tying the benefit -- by making the allowable charge the Medicare base rate and paying at 125 percent of that, that means that the plan pays 70 percent and the individual pays 30 percent. So paying -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So what's the disagreement? The Respondent does not agree with that assessment -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " That's -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " -- of your approach. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.   The -- what the Respondent seeks, in paragraph 67 of its complaint and amended complaint on pages 32 and 322 of the respective appendices, is -- is that they have a right to be paid under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act their full undiscounted charges because that is the only way to eliminate the -- the specter that they hang out there of balance billing. But what that would mean for the participant is a participant who's been paying 30 percent of 125 percent of the Medicare rate, which is $257 this year, so the participant will be paying roughly $96 per treatment, but, if the Court grants the relief ultimately that DaVita seeks, that same individual will be paying 30 percent of -- according to the Pacific Health Coalition amicus brief, the dialysis charges range from $1,041 to $6,000 per treatment.   So that same participant, instead of paying $96 per treatment, would be paying up to -- up to $1800 per treatment. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John J.

If -- if that is -- if that is a -- a common denominator among that class, then you go to the next element of the statute.

Are they on there because -- on the basis of their end-stage renal disease or the need for renal dialysis or in a -- a related matter, bearing in mind there are a number of -- of utterly lawful and reasonable classifications of -- of plans.   A plan can differentiate the benefits made available based upon seniority, collective bargaining status, geography -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, we could go down a list of these kinds of diseases with these kinds of treatments that are always necessary for that disease and only used for people with that disease.   You know, we can -- we can do diabetes Type I and insulin, or we could do antiretrovirals and AIDS.   And these are -- you know, you understand why people don't want to pay for these things.   They're expensive. But isn't that exactly what Congress was trying to do? It's saying stop trying to get out of paying for the only treatment that is appropriate for a particular disease.

We just don't have to use the words end-state -- end-stage renal disease. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Your Honor, Congress legislated both an objective and a means.   The objective plainly was to protect the Medicare fisc after the usage of the Medicare benefit had -- had grown exponentially over original projections.

The -- what the statute says is -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, you -- we could go through a whole host of these.   Mr. Waxman has a lot of them in his brief.

Kulewicz", "text": " Well, that -- of course, in the Bray case, what the Court did was to reject that sort of a classification as a basis for ipso facto invidious discrimination. Here, what -- what we are -- what this plan does, Your Honor, it's -- it's essential, it's vitally important to the case, this plan provides exactly the same benefit to every individual in the plan.   There is no -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " -- differentiation in the benefits made available.   What the Medicare Secondary Payer Act measures is, is there a difference between the benefits provided to the individuals. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I -- I want to make sure I understand your answer because, obviously, Justice Kagan's line of questioning is very important.   And I want to know if you rely on the statutory language in -- in your answer to her and whether that's how the statutory language should be read, because the practical result, obviously, is not one that I think the people writing the statute would want to sanction if it's the exact same result. But the statute says whether -- it turns on whether or not the health plan takes no notice whatsoever of whether the claimants are eligible.   So even if, for example, it's a hundred percent proxy between people who are over six feet tall and, you know, people who have blue eyes or whatever and you cannot take account of how tall they are, is it really the case that you would be fine so long as you just asked -- asked if they had blue eyes or not?

Does that give you an out? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Well, in -- in response to Your Honor's first question, we rely specifically on the text of this statute.   And what Congress did here is it, when it wrote the text of the statute, it used classifications that are laser-focused on the congressional purpose. The congressional purpose was to -- was to temper the overruns from estimates of what the Medicare eligibility was going to cost, and that's people who are eligible -- entitled to or eligible for Medicare and that -- on the basis of an ESRD diagnosis.   So that's exactly the classification that it used in the statute. It -- it is -- it is the one perfect overlap here because it -- it -- it overlaps directly with the objective of the stat -- the Medicare Secondary Payer Act.

Both said, if you differentiate and pay less for a drug that's used only for ESRD patients, that's okay -- they said that's not okay, that's a proxy, basically, but both circuits agreed that would not be okay. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " We -- Your Honor, ultimately, we -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And the Ninth Circuit also accepted the proposition that this wasn't a proxy because there were some non-ERSD patients who had acute kidney conditions that were receiving the same benefits.   But, if the other side is right, that all those people are treated in hospital, so that we go to Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that this really is a hundred percent -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " patients, you're saying you're not violating. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Of course -- of course, Your Honor, the other side is not correct in saying that there is a -- a correlation there. Ever since the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, there is no correlation.   Now people with acute kidney injury who go to outpatient dialysis, people with end-stage renal disease can get inpatient dialysis when they're -- when they're in a hospital. The -- the -- the Ninth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit, the -- the difference between the Ninth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit is the Ninth Circuit stuck with the statutory text, honored the statutory text, read it verbatim and -- and literally. The Sixth Circuit has -- has expanded upon that in a way that -- that goes far beyond the -- the -- what the text would allow. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why -- why does this not violate the statute from your point of view? I think it obviously doesn't, what I'm about to say, but I want to know why. Every single ESRD patient gets outpatient dialysis, all right? So the insurance plan says you're going to get 90 percent of the cost back.   If you have a heart attack, however, you get 95 percent of the cost back, okay? Why doesn't that violate this statute? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " So long as that -- so long as that benefit package was available, Your Honor, to everybody covered by the plan, it would not violate the statute.   The plan -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Because it did -- look, it -- it's only the ESRD patients that get 90 percent, and the heart attack patients -- "}, {"speaker": "John J.

Breyer", "text": " Why -- why doesn't that violate the statute? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " I -- I -- I misunderstood Your Honor's hypothetical.   If there were -- if there were a -- if there were a condition that singled out patients with ESRD and differentiated in the benefits to ESRD, if there was some distinction between the benefits available to a patient with ESRD and others covered by the plan, then the issue would arise under the differentiation clause. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It would, but it seems to me there are 10,000 different diseases, and I can't believe that -- that insurance plans cover them all the same.

Kulewicz", "text": " Which is exactly one of the problems with the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah, yeah, okay.   So -- so then my question.   My question was, if you give ESRD patients 90 percent, but you give people with a common cold 99 percent, you give people with heart attacks 83 percent, why doesn't all that violate the statute? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Your Honor, because the statute contains no requirement of any particular benefit.   The Medicare Secondary Payer Act does not prescribe any particular benefit for -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So your answer to Justice Kagan then is, even if there are -- everybody that gets outpatient renal dialysis has ESRD, everybody, and we give everybody 62 percent of the charge, all those ESRD, and we give some other person with a heart attack more, that doesn't violate the statute because everybody getting ESRD is getting the same?

Kulewicz", "text": " Well, Your Honor, that -- that package of benefits, if I understand Your Honor's hypothetical correctly, is one that would be applied uniform -- the same package of benefits applied uniformly across a plan in a context -- in the context of a statute that has no requirement of any specific benefit.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Nothing for me, Chief. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer, anything further? Justice Alito? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I'm somewhat baffled by this -- the statutory language.   And 1395y(b)(1)(C), I start out sort of understanding it.   The plan may not differentiate in the benefits it provides between individuals having ESRD and other individuals covered by such plan on the basis of the existence of ESRD.   All right.   I can -- I can understand that. But, after that point, a group health plan may not differentiate in the benefits it provides between individuals having ESRD and other individuals covered by such plan on the need for renal dialysis. What does that mean? In what sense is it different from what I just read? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Because what -- what that means is, if a plan -- if the reason that the different package of benefits goes to the patients with ESRD, if the reason for that is because of their need for renal dialysis, then that would -- that would constitute a -- that would state a claim under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What does that add to the language that came before it? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Because it -- well, Your Honor, it adds several things.   The -- a plan -- if a plan were to say that it would cover individuals who need kidney transplants, but it was not -- but it was going to -- it was going to be a separate package of benefits for individuals who needed renal disease -- I'm sorry, renal dialysis, that -- that, of course, would be one of the distinctions it would address. But, overall, what it addresses is, if the plan -- if the plan differentiates in the benefits between individuals with end-stage renal disease and others on the basis of the need of the individual for -- with end-stage renal disease for renal dialysis, then that would constitute a violation of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, I thought the first clause meant that if you -- you have people with end -- end-state renal disease and you have to treat them the same way, give them the same benefits as other people who are identical, except for the -- except for having ESRD, that's right? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Well, let me give you -- yeah.   I -- I think I can address Your Honor's concern.   So the -- the first qualifying phrase, \"differentiate on the basis of the existence of end-stage renal disease,\" that would be a plan that said benefits are different just by virtue of having end-stage renal disease. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " The second -- the second scenario is it would be different based upon the -- the need of somebody with end-stage renal disease for renal dialysis as opposed to a -- a -- a kidney -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   So you have somebody with end-state renal disease who needs dialysis and you're comparing that person to whom? "}, {"speaker": "John J.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, that's what -- that's what was addressed by the first language. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " But -- so -- so, if you're -- you can -- it -- it's two separate scenarios, Your Honor.   What the first clause would identify or what it addresses a package of benefits is different simply because the individual has end-stage renal disease.   That -- that would not -- that would not include persons with acute kidney injury. So then the second -- because that's -- that's not an end-stage situation.   The second qualifying phrase would address people with end-stage renal disease who need renal dialysis.   If -- if that were the basis for differentiation of the package, there would be issues under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And then we get to the third part, may not differentiate in the benefits it provides between individuals having ESRD and other individuals covered by such plan in any other manner. What does that mean? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Kulewicz", "text": " Your Honor, what that means is -- is any other manner related to the ESRD diagnosis.   Under the ejusdem generis canon of statutory construction, when we have a -- a general -- when a general word or words follow a -- a series of specific words, they necessarily relate to the condition that the -- that the limiting words address. So, in any other manner, in any other related manner, you know, for example, if the -- if a plan said that -- that benefits would be differentiated for those who need manual removal of waste products and excess fluid from the blood, I mean, that would be a -- a -- synonymous, related to the end-stage renal disease, and that would constitute a violation. They each -- each serve a separate purpose.   So the first -- the first relates to the condition.   The second relates to one of the therapies.   The third relates to differentiation on the basis of the diagnosis in general. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   Well, I will ponder all that.

And it's not particularly precise and it's not particularly grammatical, but why is that there? It's there because they know you're going to do exactly what you're doing.   It's there because they're saying don't try to distinguish between those with end-stage renal disease and those without end-stage renal disease by finding the perfect proxy, which is the therapy rather than the condition.   So that's why that's there. And then the \"in any other manner,\" in case there's a proxy that we haven't thought of, don't try that one either.   So all together this is basically saying you can't distinguish between people with end-stage renal disease and those without.   You can't do it directly.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Medicare secondary payer statute does not forbid group health plans from adopting uniform limits on coverage for renal dialysis. Fundamentally, the non-differentiation provision forbids only arrangements under which a group health plan provides different benefits to individuals with end-stage renal disease and other individuals covered by the plan. Petitioners' plan does not do that. Respondents' proxy theory is therefore irrelevant.   Its plan is not providing a different package of benefits in the first place, by proxy or otherwise. Now it's true that uniform limits on dialysis principally affect those who need dialysis the most, but this statute also does not impose disparate impact liability. Respondents' contrary view is inconsistent with the text, purpose, and history of the statute and would be unworkable in practice. This statute serves an important but limited function in coordinating benefits between Medicare and group health plans.   It does not entitle dialysis providers to any particular level of reimbursement. I welcome the Court's questions.

The provisions in this statute have been in substantially the same form since 1989, and CMS's implementing regulations, including a regulation that expressly permits plans to impose uniform limits on coverage for dialysis, those regulations have been on the books since 1995. And we haven't seen the sky falling. We haven't seen examples -- many examples in which there is -- plans have engaged in creative ways to try to circumvent the statute, but, certainly, a decision from this Court could bring renewed prominence to this issue, so we don't -- we don't sort of take those policy concerns lightly. Of course, Medicare itself is available as a backstop here.   The whole design of this statutory scheme is that individuals who develop end-stage renal disease after three months of dialysis, they are eligible to enroll in Medicare.   And during the 30-month coordination of benefits period, Medicare is there, if they would like to enroll in Medicare and pay for Part B, Medicare is there to cover any potential gaps in the coverage that the group health plan provides.

If you have somebody that's -- you know, it's a hundred percent proxy, it does not take whatever it is you're not supposed to take, Medicare eligibility, into account at all, but it just turns out that the group is the same as it would be if it did take the Medicare in -- into account? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Sure.   You know, again, as I said at the outset, I don't think the proxy theory is really sufficient for Respondents to prevail in this case, and that's just a result of the plain text of the statute. 1395y(b)(1)(C)(ii) states that group health plans \"may not differentiate in the benefits it provides\" -- a group health plan \"may not differentiate in the benefits it provides between individuals with end-stage renal disease and others covered by the plan.\" And if a plan is providing the same package of benefits to all individuals who are covered by the plan, which is what Petitioners' plan does, then it is not differentiating in the benefits it has provided, and, therefore, it is not violating this specific provision. And so there's no -- no occasion arises to -- to inquire into whether the plan is drawing a -- a line among plan participants on an impermissible basis or on a -- as a matter of a proxy for an impermissible basis because there's no improper line drawing in the first instance. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and -- and how about my view of the statutory language, which does suggest that the statutory language itself indicates a concern that proxies will be found and attempting to really cut that off at the pass? In other words, you know, don't distinguish between these two groups, people with ESRD and those without, based on the fact that they have the disease or based on the fact that they need renal dialysis or based on some other proxy you can come up with.   Just don't do it at all. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " I take the point, Justice Kagan, and -- and, in some ways, that's another reason -- I mean, the statutory text itself here furnishes an additional basis that you don't need to kind of import into this coordination of benefits statute the concept of proxy discrimination drawn -- drawn from an opposite body of federal civil rights law.

So I'm giving you, like, please, help me.   Is there a policy reason you're on this side? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Sure.   Let -- let me see what I can do there. The principle that we are here to vindicate, which is that uniform limitations on coverage for renal dialysis do not themselves constitute impermissible differentiation, is a principle that is reflected in the regulations that CMS, the expert agency charged with administering this statute, has enacted, and that's Section 161(c) in Part 411.   And the position that we are taking here is the one that is most consistent with the agency's longstanding regulation. Now, as to the broader question about, you know, wouldn't it be in the government's best financial interests for there to be, you know, circumstances in which group health plans could be compelled to pay higher rates to dialysis providers, you know, I don't -- I think part -- part of the story there is that Congress has, in general, in this statute chosen not to create an entitlement to dialysis coverage. That's consistent with Congress's overall choices in this area.   In particular, ERISA, which is the preeminent federal law regulating the design of health benefits plans, does not mandate that plans cover particular services, and that's -- that's true even with respect to ERISA's non-discrimination provision. And we think this statute fundamentally operates in the same way as that. It does not forbid uniform limitations on particular services.   That is the policy decision that Congress made here.   It's the decision -- it's a policy that is reflected in the Secretary's regulations, and -- and that -- that's why we have chosen to support the Petitioners in this case. Now, you know, again, we -- we have filed in support of reversal, not actually in support of Petitioners' brief, because we have policy concerns that plan practices like this could ultimately lead to greater costs for the Medicare program and -- and potentially worse coverage or worse options for individuals with end-stage renal disease.   We just don't think the statute in its current form prohibits the -- the particular plan provisions that are under scrutiny here. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could I ask you the question that I asked Petitioner about whose financial interests are at stake here? And I'm particularly concerned about the patients with end-stage renal disease. He said that an affirmance here would work against their financial interests.   Is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " It's hard to predict with certainty how -- how that would play out, Justice Alito.   I take Petitioners' point to be that an affirmance, meaning that this plan was obligated to reimburse Respondents at Respondents' undiscounted rates, would mean that the -- an individual's coinsurance obligation, which under this plan is 30 percent of whatever the plan reimbursement rate is, would -- would skyrocket because they would be required to pay 30 percent of the undiscounted rate. The -- the other point that Petitioners and their amici have made is that because the Medicare secondary payer statute itself does not require that group health plans provide coverage for renal dialysis, a decision in Respondents' favor might mean that more group health plans choose not to cover dialysis at all if -- if, you know, the result of covering it would be exposing them to liability under the statute. I just -- it's really -- it's difficult to -- to predict with any certainty what -- what would happen there.   Certainly, as I -- as I said before, Medicare is a backstop here.   The Medicare Part B monthly premium is $170.   That's a pretty reasonable amount. Individuals who are concerned that their group health plans may provide insufficient coverage for their dialysis needs during the coordination period can enroll in Medicare as the secondary payer. And -- and -- and even in that circumstance, that's going to save Medicare money in the sense that, you know, if -- if you take a circumstance -- if you take a situation in which the group health plan provides a relatively parsimonious coverage for outpatient dialysis and an individual makes a decision to enroll in Medicare as the secondary payer during the coordination period, the group health plan is still covering all of that individual's other medical expenses, and that's going to save Medicare money.   Medicare only steps in as the secondary payer with respect to items or services that the group health plan does not fully cover. And, you know, that -- that's sort of -- that's another cost-saving feature of the statute irrespective of the dialysis issue. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could I ask you to follow up a bit on what you said about workability?

But, if it's interpreted the way the Sixth Circuit interpreted it and the way Respondent interpreted it, you have the people who have end-stage renal disease and they need kidney dialysis, and the plan pays a certain amount of money to them for that service.   What do you compare that to? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " I entirely agree with you, Justice Alito.   I don't think Respondents have very clearly answered that question.   And as Judge Murphy explained in his partial dissent in the Sixth Circuit, it's -- the Medicare secondary payer statute itself does not provide guideposts for making that kind of judgment. There is no kind of obvious comparator in terms of -- you know, if -- if it were a viable theory under the statute to say that you can't treat dialysis itself differently than some other services, what are those other services? Respondents have never said. And so I do think that their view would -- would -- would give rise to substantial practical problems. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.

Congress determined that, and it determined it because Congress understood in 1972 and in 1981 and thereafter that ESRD patients uniquely and utterly need outpatient dialysis for the rest of their lives. And a plan whose purpose as alleged here and effect is to move primary coverage of ESRD patients to Medicare is one that most certainly \"takes into effect those patients' eligibility for Medicare.\" The reading urged by the Petitioners and the solicitor general by which the anti-discrimination provision bars only plans that single out ESRD patients by name and the take-into-account provision only applies to plans that reference Medicare eligibility expressly, renders both of these statutory protections utterly toothless.

Take the anti-discrimination -- the anti-differentiation provision, which has occupied, I think, virtually all of the argument so far. That provision protects ESRD patients by prohibiting differential treatment either by express reference to ESRD patients or by proxy. The particular proxy codified in the statute and the one that is relevant here expressly prohibits differential treatment \"on the basis of the need for renal diagnosis,\" a treatment that Congress has long understood to be completely inseparable from ESRD itself. Ninety-nine and a half percent of all of DaVita's outpatient patients, outpatient dialysis patients, have ESRD.   There is simply no reasonable argument for singling out ES -- outpatient dialysis as anything but differential treatment of individuals with ESRD. And as was noted, I think by Justice Sotomayor, even the Ninth Circuit in Amy's Kitchen agreed, and I'm quoting from the opinion, \"a plan would violate the MSP if it provided differential coverage for routine maintenance dialysis,\" that is, dialysis received only by persons with ESRD, than for all other -- all other dialysis.   That is exactly what this plan does. Now, as -- I know that I'm trenching on my two minutes, but I -- please interrupt me, but I just wanted to reference the fact that as has been mentioned by several members of the Court, there is another provision that is on the basis of either ESRD, calling it out by name, or the need for renal dialysis or any other manner. And that's because, as -- as I think Justice Kagan's question suggested, Congress understood at the time that other proxies for ESRD might exist or more likely might come to exist with medical advances. And so the statute also prohibits differentiation on any other manner, which, in context, should be understood to mean in any other manner that in effect singles out a treatment for ESRD. I want to clarify just a couple of, I think, errors that my friend on the other side made.   The notion that they are actually helping beneficiaries because they are limiting the amount of balance billing available is -- is utterly wrong. This -- one of the main reasons that -- that renal dialysis is disadvantaged here is that the plan says unilaterally there is no in-network service for this.   If there were in-network service, as there is for virtually all employment group plans in the United States -- this is an extreme outlier.   There's no balance billing at all. If there was an in-network option -- and this goes to -- to, I think, Justice Alito's questions about who's harmed.   If there was an in-network option, there would be no balance billing and there -- and patients would have a right to treatment.   They would have a right to treatment by somebody who was in network.   Right now, they don't. And as the -- there -- there are some really terrific and very knowledgeable amicus briefs filed in this case.   It is completely clear and Congress has understood that if this Court accepts the other side's ruling, there is no reason on God's green earth that UnitedHealth and AEtna and all the -- all the big plans that -- that -- health plans and big, big employer health plans, all of whom do not differentiate in any basis on the need for renal dialysis, I mean, they -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And you can say, well, does that differentiate or doesn't it differentiate? I mean, I would say, in that -- in that situation, it probably doesn't differentiate, but the salient point, to your question and Justice Alito's question, is that they have the same problem in their reading of the statute. In their reading of the statute, they say, well, look, you can forget the last 18 words of the statute.   All you have to know is whether it differentiates on the basis of people who have ESRD.

They each have a piece of paper which describes the whole plan.   In this piece of paper, it says ESRD outpatient and it is identical whether you have the disease, whether you don't have the disease, you might get the disease, maybe you had it and it wasn't paid for, but anybody who has it or gets it or whatever it is will be paid identically.

Waxman", "text": " Well, I think Mr. Guarnieri has told you in his argument that the government is on the other side because it -- it -- it feels some duty to defend one particular sub-provision of its regulations which, as our briefs explain, is inconsistent with both the statute and the provision that immediately precedes it. He has said in his brief and today here that the government is quite troubled by what this plan is trying to do and it acknowledges that there very likely will be an adverse financial effect on the Medicare fisc if the Court reverses and adopts the -- the reading of the statute that -- that Judge Murphy provided in dissent below. But here -- here is -- and I -- I -- I apologize if I was wrangling with you, but I was objecting to your suggestion, which I know you don't mean, but I had heard it mistakenly, that the only people who are harmed here are possibly the Medicare fisc and my company or the companies. The harm here -- and this is -- this is probably laid out as well as anywhere by the amicus brief of the dialysis patients coalition, which is three -- 30,000 dialysis ESRD sufferers, who explain all the ways in which the provisions of this plan harm people. Now it -- you can say that, you know, this is just a payment dispute, but it's not. The core benefit that these plans provide is payment for medical services. And there's real harm, number one, that in -- there is no -- uniquely, for this service, there is no in-network available.   So there is no provider who has agreed not to balance bill and who has guaranteed that you can get treatment. It requires higher co-pays and deductibles, up to $7,000 a year.   It doesn't provide any relief whatsoever for the first three months in which there is no Medicare backstop. And you can say: Oh, well, this is the Medicare Secondary Payer Act, you can always enroll in Medicare secondary.   The government says that's an extra $170 a month, which is, by the way, the minimum.   It is certainly not applicable to everybody. You pay Medicare $170 a month or $250 a month if you can get the secondary coverage. This is in addition to what these people of limited means and who are facing end-of-life worries are already paying to the group health plan.

The reason that it exists, and I think my friends on the other side agree, is because Congress has chosen to -- for purposes of Medicare or Medicare CMS has chosen, to reimburse plan -- the centers at less than the actual cost of providing the service, with the understanding that in a few instances, that is, the 10 percent of people who get outpatient dialysis, they operate under negotiated in-network plans with the providers.

First of all, a few lines above is the provision about -- that deals with people over 65, and it says, number one, you can't take into account the fact that they're eligible for Medicare, which is the same as the take-into-account provision here. And, second, it says, you must provide -- they shall -- people over 65 shall be entitled to the same benefits under the same conditions as any other individual under age 65. That's not what this provision -- what our provision says. What our provision says is you can't differentiate on the benefits you provide between individuals having ESRD and other individuals covered by the plan on the basis of -- and then it explains what it means to differentiate -- on the basis of express.   You can't do it.   You can't call it out by name. There is a statutory proxy.   You may not do it on the basis of the need for renal dialysis, and you may not do it in any other manner that serves as a proxy for what ESRD patients uniquely need. That reading of the statute, Justice Kagan's reading of the statute, gives meaning to every word of the statute.   The government's reading or the Petitioners' reading gives no meaning whatsoever. The one example the government was able to come up with in its brief, which is, well, some plans may give greater benefits based on tenure and people with ESRD may be older, fails because a plan that gives higher benefits based on tenure doesn't even meet their test for the first part of the clause.   It's not differentiating on the basis of ESRD. I mean, the anomaly in this case -- and I would be interested in MedBen's lawyer response to this -- is, as we allege in the complaint, MedBen, which is the plan administrator and this little consulting firm that's come up with the language that was imposed by this plan, its -- it expressly touts the benefit of its ability to \"reduce dialysis procedures provided to ESRD patients\" by implementing our proprietary dialysis health plan language. And, in this case, it is here trying to deny that that is what its plan does. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Breyer, anything?

First, in response -- in further response to Justice Alito's question about the network, it does, of course, take two to network.   DaVita never tells you or never says either in the record or even up to today that it wants to come into the network.   What it seeks is the right to be paid at its undiscounted charges. That would destroy any incentive to come into network.   It would have, obviously, the catastrophic effect upon patients in the plans that we've discussed. Justice Breyer, in response to your ongoing search for a comparator, we -- we still have not heard one.   We don't have a comparator in the brief of the Respondents.   We have not heard one today.   What -- what comparator? If we say that there is disparate impact and it should be equal, the question is equal to what? We haven't seen it in the briefs.   We still don't see it today. My -- my friend indicated that -- that the -- this cost containment measure of the plan is unique to the plan.   But, if the Court would look at any -- from pages -- pages 52 through 92 of the Joint Appendix alone, there are 10 other examples in there, including five other out-of-network situations that the plan addresses, one other reference-based price that the plan uses, and four extraordinarily costly surgical centers that are -- that are completely excluded from the plan. These don't have anything to do with dialysis, but the point that I want to make is that dialysis is not the only situation that is a cost-containment function here. And then, finally, in -- in response to Justice Sotomayor's question about what would happen to -- to plans, plans, of course -- or, I'm sorry, what would happen -- what would happen to providers, the providers, of course, have gone to Congress before to get an increase in the Medicare rate.   They are still able to do that. And if the Court were to reverse, as we are asking in this case, and enter final judgment in favor of Petitioners on all claims, perhaps that will give Respondents the incentive to negotiate a network rate that is fair and reasonable.
