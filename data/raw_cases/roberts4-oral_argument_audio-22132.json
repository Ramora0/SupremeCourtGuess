[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this afternoon in Case 08-969, Hemi Group v. The City of New York.   Mr. Barnhouse. "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Possessory and use taxes are extremely difficult to collect, even under the best of circumstances.   Indeed, here the city alleges in its second amended complaint that it only collected 40 cents on the dollar, and its response claims a collection rate of 55 cents on the dollar.   Yet it wants to collect 300 cents on the dollar from my clients, who never owed these taxes in the first place.   The Respondent City of New York alleged two RICO claims and pendent State law violations that the city said resulted in a lost sovereign opportunity to collect cigarette possessory taxes from its city residents.   The alleged lost opportunity to tax was based on claims that my clients and 50 other defendants in four consolidated cases did not send names of customers to the State of New York and had statements on their website saying sales were tax-free and no tobacco taxes applied.   The Federal district court dismissed all claims.   The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated one of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners, the Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and affirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its common law fraud claims.   Yet reinstating the one RICO claim was improper because the city does not have standing to sue, based on the injuries that it has alleged.   It does not have standing because the city's claim that it lost the sovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to business, and it's not an injury to property. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

The district court described that source of injury as farfetched.   Those were Judge Batts' words.   The second source of injury they claim is that by not reporting to the State of New York, the city then did not receive information about which city residents purchased cigarettes, and the city could then not go to those residents who had not self-assessed, and-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

When the Court first started applying proximate cause requirements in the antitrust law and in RICO, it was looking at, as I understand it, the -- the common law analysis of proximate cause, and -- and it really discussed the elements of that quite clearly in the Associated General Contractors case where it talks about five or six factors that the Court has to look at, those factors being the nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury, is it -- whether it was the type that the antitrust laws were intended to forestall, or here the RICO laws.   We would submit that it is not.   It's an injury to a sovereign interest.   The directness of the injury.   Here the injury is indirect.   It either comes -- flows through the citizens who didn't pay their taxes or through the State that didn't get the reports of customers in the city. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Can you go back to the question I had asked you and was not finished getting your position on.   Jenkins requires report to the State.   You say the city was not within the zone of interest.   But from the point of view of the sellers, the out-of-state sellers of cigarettes, my goodness, would they really want not only to have the burden of sending a list of names to the State, but to every county and municipality?   Isn't it the -- just as it is in New York, there is a working relationship.   The State gets all the names, and then it sends the names to the cities.   You -- you -- I -- you're suggesting that it would be okay if the Jenkins Act had made it even more burdensome to the cigarette sellers by saying not only do you have to disclose to the State but also to any municipality that independently taxes cigarettes? "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, Congress could have given the States power to share those lists, but it did not under the Jenkins Act.   And it's not clear that -- that -- even the agreement-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Is it -- we're told that New York City and New York State have a tax informationsharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share this information with the city.

Barnhouse", "text": " --The -- the agreement, and it's quoted on page 6 of the response -- and I want to get this right -- says, Justice Ginsburg in paragraph 1 of the quote, in footnote 6:   \"Provided, that the disclosure of that information is permissible under existing laws and agreements. \"   And this is proprietary information.   These are customer lists. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, what do you do with -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical?   I mean, she can pursue her own question, but I'm interested in the answer.   Her question is, suppose the statute were amended so that the information had to be given to the city as well as to the State; would the case then be different, hypothetical case? "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " Yes, it would be different, because in that instance the city would be the -- would -- would as -- would -- would be the direct victim, would be within the zone of interest of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Are there any sanctions for failing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own, without having to go through RICO? "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " Justice Scalia, it's a misdemeanor violation and it has to be prosecuted by the U.S. Government.   Those -- that's the extent of the Jenkins Act.   And -- and the -- and what the city has done here, as Judge Winter noted in his dissent, is take the misdemeanor Federal criminal law and bootstrap it into RICO, seeking 300 cents on the dollar through mail and wire fraud.   These sales occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico.   And it's my client's position, and it's no secret, he says on his websites that he doesn't -- that the Jenkins Act, the scope of the Jenkins Act does not include his sales.   There -- there's a dispute with the city on that, but it's not even clear that the State had a right to get these names, much less the city.   Yet the city is claiming because it didn't get the names -- and if it had the names it claims a recovery rate between 40 cents and 55 cents on the dollar -- it should be able to collect 300 cents on the dollar from a business that didn't owe them in the first place.   Because the civil RICO has a separate standing requirement separate from mail and wire fraud, as Justice O'Connor discussed in Holmes that it's not just the predicate act's standing requirement, but -- but the person injured in his business or property by reason of -- because Congress took this \"business or property\" language right out of the antitrust laws unchanged, the court in Hawaii interpreted that language.   The court drew a bright line.   It was a pragmatic line, a workable line, an important line, that that business or property did not include injury to a sovereign interest.   The opportunity to collect taxes is a sovereign interest.   The taxes themselves, once collected or assessed, could be property, but not the opportunity.   The injury flows either through the States or consumers and, therefore, is not proximate.   These websites were not State-specific, much less city-specific. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But you don't -- you don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the taxes?   If there's some way in which someone else contributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely that the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's not automatically outside the scope of proximate cause, is it? "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " It wouldn't automatically be outside the scope of proximate cause, but if -- if it was action that made it more or less feasible.   But it would be unreasonable under this Court's decision in U.S. v. Boyle, where you -- where the Court held that you cannot rely even on an agent for purposes of not filing taxes -- it would be unreasonable for anyone to rely on language on a vendor's Internet -- commercial language on a vendor's Internet website to -- to -- to decide that for some reason they didn't have an obligation to pay.   And these websites had language that said -- the city attached the -- the pages from the websites themselves to the -- they were part of the record, the RICO record.   I had those just a second ago and I can't seem to find them.   But the -- the website pages for my client specifically had languages noted in the briefs that said these are not city-specific or State-specific, that -- that you need to contact -- you should contact your State officials for purposes of determining what your individual obligations are regarding possession and tax.

There -- there are lots of reasons that, even when the city gets the names and even under its allegations of collection rates, Justice Ginsburg, very small, 40 cents to 55 cents on the dollar. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Do we know if these Jenkins Act lists -- are they in fact maintained by the State? "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " It -- it's my understanding, Justice Ginsburg, that the State would receive Jenkins Act reports from some vendors.   Those can come in all sorts of different formats, some of it just stacks of paper perhaps.   And it would be the State's responsibility then to go through those, select which ones were residents of the city of New York, and then decide whether under existing laws it was even permitted to share this proprietary information with the city, before giving those to the city.   It would then be the city's responsibility to take the list given to it by the State and decide who hasn't paid.   Then there's the exemption issue that comes on top of that.   And then go out and try to collect these amounts, which they allege to have done in at least two instances.   Finally, the policy -- I'm sorry.   The policy that this Court adopted in Hawaii makes a -- makes very much sense, as recognized by courts who have looked at issues such as additional fire protection, payment of -- of public benefits, other instances where governments have come forward and under RICO tried to bring a claim to recover actual out-of-pocket expenses, overtime that was paid to police that had to monitor protests against abortion clinics, public benefits paid to people who were not legally in the country and working in agriculture.   Governments have brought those and the circuit courts of appeals in both of those instances said those are injury to sovereign interests, citing Hawaii, and not the kind of injury to business or property that Congress intended when it adopted RICO.   If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Koerner. "}, {"speaker": "Leonard J.

Oklahoma, where in an original jurisdiction case Wyoming sued the State of Oklahoma on the ground that the State's regulation which attempted to require Oklahoma coal-fired generation plants to use 10 percent of Oklahoma coal, and prior to the legislation all of Wyoming coal was used in the generation plant.   Wyoming sued in this Court and the defense was that Wyoming didn't have an interest because it lost the opportunity to collect taxes.

In that particular case the issue of definition of property was the exact same issue that you have in the RICO case.   Indeed, mail and wire fraud is a predicate for RICO.   In that case there was, as Justice Ginsburg noted, a criminal prosecution based on the importation of alcohol into Canada from Maryland.   The charge was wire fraud.   And first, there were two issues: One, the revenue rule, which is not relevant here.   But the first issue was whether or not the opportunity to collect taxes which Canada lost, whether that was an injury to property.   And there was a long discussion by this Court equating the lost opportunity with embezzlement from the Canadian treasury and pointing out in the definition of Black's and the Webster's definition that property includes not only that which you actually have, but that which you were denied the opportunity.

It's hard to say that Congress didn't contemplate this when, in addition to the general definition, they put this in.   In addition, the Jenkins Act was passed in 1949 precisely for this problem, so it was on congressional minds.

What we are saying is he is aware that he has an obligation to file reports with the State indicating both the identity of the seller and the identity of the purchaser.   Our predicate act is not Jenkins.   Our predicate act is wire and mail fraud.   Even if Jenkins did not exist, we would still have a wire and mail fraud cause of action based on the representations of the seller, which is that all the sales are tax-free.   What Jenkins does through the cooperation agreement is it gives us the mechanism to collect these taxes when they're complied with.   If the defendant by active intervention does not file and instead advertises no sales tax required, he is preventing us from-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But do you know -- do we know that?   Do we know whether the Petitioner has in fact filed the Jenkins Act report with New York State? "}, {"speaker": "Leonard J.

Indeed, he has actively represented in the website that he has no obligation to file the report, and that any information that he obtains from the purchaser is confidential. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   So I think that their response to the mail and fraud is, you're right, it is all mail -- it is all mail fraud.   All these tax violations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax return normally. "}, {"speaker": "Leonard J. Koerner", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

So normally it's State if it's a State tax.   But it's one thing to say Congress didn't care about that and quite another thing to say that Congress didn't care if the States were going to use this in order to collect three times what the taxes are owed.   And so they're looking for a way to cut off this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax -- failure to pay your State taxes.   And that's why they've hit on this idea of the antitrust.   I don't know if that's a satisfactory idea.   I don't see the solution.   I think I see the problem. "}, {"speaker": "Leonard J.

It has very severe penalties under RICO criminally.   It allows for fines and forfeitures.   But more important, you can use RICO civilly, and the only economic injury in that entire legislation is the lost opportunity to collect taxes.   So it's difficult to say that Congress was not aware of this problem, aware of its potential scope.   And while I understand this Court's frustration, it seems to me, as this Court has said in many cases, including the last one, Boyle, it resides with Congress to change it.   If they feel there is a misuse of this legislation and suits are exploding out of context in terms of what they contemplated, then they should change it.   Yet-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

What is the difference between that situation and this situation? "}, {"speaker": "Leonard J. Koerner", "text": " Well, first of all, in time, the Internet has raised many issues.   It's unclear how Congress feels about this.   We have legitimate enterprise.   But cigarettes have been a particular focus, and I think, in effect, you cannot use the general argument as to the Internet, when you have congressional legislation which, one, under the Jenkins Act, was specifically passed in 1949 because of transactions like this, where States were -- were being deprived of the revenues through the interstate shipments.   And you have the traffic -- the Cigarette Trafficking Act which is, again, an expression by Congress that they want these individuals to be put out of business.   That's exactly what RICO is about.

What -- what was the basis for his statement that the State appears uninterested? "}, {"speaker": "Leonard J.

Mr. Barnhouse, you have four minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Justice Stevens, the city brought exactly that case, where one of the 50 defendants here was a defendant that didn't say sales are tax-free, and that case was similarly dismissed by the district court, and that dismissal was affirmed by the Second Circuit.   Justice Breyer, in Illinois v. Fawaz, the States was going after $14,500 in back sales and gasoline taxes.   After having prosecuted the individual, they were seeking civil RICO damages, in that Seventh Circuit case, when the Seventh Circuit became the first circuit to say, we -- we hesitantly believe that the case could go forward beyond a motion to dismiss.

Some don't.   They have the numbers there.   They get more than half. "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " It's -- it's foreseeable that some won't pay.

I mean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a lot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb in the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets mugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though there is an intervening criminal act.   Now, maybe what you want to argue is that that -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to either criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and that maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut off causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as -- such as RICO.   That would be a reasonable argument. "}, {"speaker": "Randolph H. Barnhouse", "text": " That's a great argument, Justice Scalia.   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "John G.
