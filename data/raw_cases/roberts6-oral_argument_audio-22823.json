[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next this morning in Case Number 11-1118, Gunn v. Minton.   Ms. Webre? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   In Grable, this Court explained that arising under jurisdiction demands not only a contested Federal issue, but a substantial one embedded in a State claim in order to indicate whether there is a serious Federal interest in exercising Federal jurisdiction over the State claim.   This Court should reverse the judgment below because Minton -- Mr. Minton's claims do not present a substantial Federal issue, and exercising Federal jurisdiction over his claim and legal malpractice claims like his, State legal malpractice claims would-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The question is whether the experimental use, whether that was a viable theory.   Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you mean by \u201c substantial \u201d? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, defining substantiality is a difficult point.   I would answer in two layers.   First, Mr. Minton's claim did not involve a legal question of does the -- how does the experimental use doctrine work; how is it applied, what are its parameters.   The question was, did his fact-bound and situation-specific affidavit present relevant evidence of the application here in this particular case.   And it is not a substantial question because, first, from a unique case perspective, it involved merely a hypothetical determination.   There were no actual patent rights that would be at issue.   Those were already fully, finally, irrevocably determined in the underlying patent litigation in Federal court.   And second, from a jurisprudence standpoint, the question of uniformity of patent law, any decision by a State court in Mr. Minton's legal malpractice claim would not be binding in any way on either the PTO in a patent application, or on any subsequent Federal court deciding a real patent case. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You mean substantial beyond the -- this particular case? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   And I think that that's where the Federal circuit jurisdictional -- the Federal circuits \u201c arising under \u201d jurisdiction standard which the Supreme Court of Texas applied here, that's exactly where it goes awry, is that the court improperly conflates the question of necessity of a Federal issue with the question of whether that issue is substantial.   And in the Grable case, this Court emphasized that those are two separate issues.   There are four prongs to the Grable test: The Federal issue embedded in the State claim must be necessary to the State claim; actually disputed; substantial; and then there is a federalism inquiry that exercised a Federal jurisdiction over this State claim can't upend the proper balance between State and Federal authority.   The Grable court announced that, and then just a year later in the Empire Healthchoice case, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, you wrote that opinion for the Court, and that acted sort of as an underscoring of   \"and here's how limited the Grable rule really is. \"   The Empire Healthchoice opinion distinguishes between Grable, which presented a merely pure question of law, and the claims at issue in Empire Healthchoice which were fact-bound and situation-specific.   It distinguished the -- the question of whether a State court is competent to apply Federal law to the extent relevant to the claims and found that, yes, it was.   And the Court emphasized that certainly the State courts are going to be deciding the occasional Federal issue here and there, but let's not make a Federal case out of each and every State tort claim that might have an embedded Federal issue.   Now, in the earlier argument, there was some discussion of the fact that jurisdiction means a lot of different things in a lot of different contexts.   But here, this Court has on more than one occasion determined that jurisdiction, \u201c arising under \u201d jurisdiction, means the same thing in 1331, the general Federal question jurisdictional grant, and 1338(a), the -- the exclusive provision that's applicable specifically to patents.   Now, that has been amended slightly.   It now includes compulsory counterclaims where they didn't used to be a part.   But the jurisdictional grant that Congress gave through the first sentence of 1338(a) uses the same exact phrase, the \u201c arising under \u201d,   \"any civil action arising under Federal law. \"   And Justice Scalia, you wrote the opinion for the Court in the Holmes Group case and explained that the linguistic consistency between those two means that they mean the same thing.   There is nothing unique about this subject matter, the patent subject matter, that changes the scope of the jurisdictional grant.   To be sure, the grant of original jurisdiction to the district courts is exclusive and that is different from the general Federal question. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, why isn't that significant?   Doesn't that manifest Congress's view that this is a complicated specialty area, and so there would be arguably a special reason for having these cases, cases that involve a patent issue, in Federal court rather than State court? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   But the Congress did that in a couple of different ways.   First of all, I think it begs the question, it begs the core question, to say that exclusive -- the fact that jurisdiction is exclusive answers the substantiality, because in order to get to exclusivity of the jurisdiction you have to get to jurisdiction first.   You have to -- it has to be arising under an act of Congress relating to patents before it can then be exclusive.   So -- so we still have the first step.   But also, Congress did not cast a net broader than the general \u201c arising under \u201d standard.   Even under the statutory framework after the America Invents Act amendment, under the statutory structure there are still a number of patent issues, legal issues that are going to be decided in the State courts, that do not come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts.   For example, compulsory counterclaims now come within the exclusive jurisdiction, but permissive counterclaims don't.   Permissive counterclaims can certainly present just as substantive a question of patent law, and yet those are excluded under the statutory scheme of 1338(a).   Patent issues raised as a defensive matter are not sufficient to support \u201c arising under \u201d jurisdiction under 1338(a).   So certainly, Congress contemplated a situation where some patent issues are just not going to come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts.   And I think it's interesting to back up a little bit and look at the Federal Circuit's evolved perception of its own exclusive jurisdiction.   In the early years of the Federal Circuit in 1984, the first Chief Justice -- the first chief judge of the court, Chief Judge Markey, in the Atari case that is cited at page 21 of the amicus brief filed by the American Intellectual Property Lawyers Association, the Federal Circuit wrote,   \"Congress was not concerned that an occasional patent law decision of a regional circuit court or of a State court would defeat its goal of increased uniformity in the national law of patents. \"   That was the view of the Federal Circuit's own jurisdiction in 1984.   But in the time evolved, the Federal Circuit has changed its perception of its own jurisdiction and that's why we are here today.   In 2007, the Federal Circuit went awry and -- and changed the standard that no longer follows what this Court articulated in Grable.   They have improperly conflated the necessity and substantiality components of the -- of an appropriate Grable analysis, and they totally disregard a proper balance of the State and Federal interests.   The Federal Circuit announced that there's an interest in -- Federal interest in uniformity of patent law, and then that was that.   That was the end of the inquiry.   There is no balance if you don't look at the State interest on the other side.   And in legal malpractice cases in general and in Mr. Minton's claim in particular, there are substantial State interests.   There is the general interest, the right of a State to develop its own State claims, its own State law and its own State courts.   But there is also a State interest in governing the relationship between attorney and client that happens through the legal malpractice process.   But specifically with regard to Mr. Minton's claim, one of his primary theories in this case, in the legal malpractice case, is that the attorney's error with regard to bringing up the experimental use doctrine deprived him of the opportunity to make a lucrative settlement with the NASD in the underlying patent litigation.   Well, the question of exactly how you prove whether and to what extent the NASD would have paid a settlement and for how much in the underlying case is a matter of tremendous dispute right now.   That is an evolving issue in the -- in the legal malpractice jurisprudence of the State of Texas.   In fact, in the month of December 2012, the Supreme Court of Texas heard argument in a case called Elizondo v. Krist that addresses that precise issue: How do you prove that NASDAQ would have paid him $100 million if only these lawyers had raised this issue earlier?   And yet, if Mr. Minton's claims are hailed into Federal court because of the fact-bound and situation-specific application of the experimental law doctrine, the Federal courts would be -- to that important issue that the State courts really need to resolve. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Ms. Webre, is there any binding effect of a Federal determination here on State law, and is there any binding effect of any State determination here on Federal law? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " No, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " If it was left to the State, would what the States say about patent law be binding in any Federal cases, and, vice versa, if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything that the Federal court says about -- about State tort law be binding on State courts? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " In neither direction would any decision be binding.   The State -- any decision in a State court on a legal malpractice matter regarding issues of patent law would not be binding in any way on the Federal courts or on the PTO in handling any of the patent applications, prosecution of patents. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " That -- that being so, your -- your last argument about the Federal government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this single case.   I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas law in that regard.   They may get this case wrong, but-- "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " You are right that it will not substantially adversely impact Texas State law, but that's an illustration of a substantial State interest.   In a way, it's akin to the issue in Grable, because the -- the embedded issue in Grable that justified this Court reaching down and grabbing a State law claim and bringing it up into Federal court wasn't just that the issue was disputed, the construction of that statute was unresolved; but that it needed resolving.   It needed resolving by a court whose decision could be precedential so then it's resolved from then on.   And so the question of how do you prove a settlement is an issue that needs resolving by a court who's going to advance the jurisprudence. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --What about the Federal issue?   Doesn't that need resolving? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " There are no Federal issues that need resolving here, because it's solely a question of the application of these specific facts in this affidavit to the doctrine.   There's -- there's no overarching question of patent law that needs resolving. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Let me ask this question: Suppose you have two cases, hypothetical, case A, case B, both involve the experimental use doctrine in Federal patent law.   In case A, it's a very weak argument; it's most unlikely it's not going to apply.   Case B, very strong argument, experimental use doctrine applies.   Any difference in the removability in those two cases? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the question isn't the significance to the particular claim.   The question is the Federal issue.   Is there a-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, if -- if you say -- since you're going to say it -- I mean, if it's a \u201c substantial \u201d Federal issue, then it's substantial in hypothetical B but not in hypothetical A? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --Well, it's perhaps more necessary.   But -- and maybe what I need to do is back up a little bit and discuss what I think are the factors for a court to look at when deciding whether or not an embedded Federal issue is a substantial one.   In looking at this Court's articulation in the Grable case and the Empire Healthchoice case, the issues that the Court looked at, one was the nature of the Federal -- of the Federal question itself, the Federal issue, is it a constitutional issue. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So does that mean that if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts -- how does that change your analysis? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " That would be a more substantial Federal question than the one presented here, but I submit that it would not be sufficient to warrant \u201c arising under \u201d jurisdiction here, because it is -- it involves only a hypothetical actual set of patent rights.   No judgment that can happen in a State legal malpractice case actually impacts any patent rights.   Let's say Mr. Minton won a judgment from a State legal malpractice court saying it was the negligence, that you would have won the experimental use exception, your patent would have been declared valid, and so he has a judgment from a State court saying, The loss of your patent was the result of a negligence and not because it was actually invalid.   That doesn't give him a valid patent.   He cannot take that judgment and then sue somebody and say, Look, look, I've got a patent.   And it's-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So go back to -- you were going through a list of questions, and I posited, let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a constitutional question. "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --Yes.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Then what other factors-- "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --Well, the -- the -- in the continuum constitutional issues would be more substantial, statutory issues would be a little less substantial.   In fact, this Court grappled with that in the Grable case and said, We're not going to draw a hard and fast line on statutory issues, but then in the Empire HealthChoice opinion, the Court noted that this is a non -- the issue -- the Federal issue there was nonstatutory, and so therefore, let's not make a Federal case out of it.   So in that continuum, that would be one factor to look at.   Another factor to look at would be, is the Federal issue, the legal issue undisputed or uncertain?   Not necessarily the application of these particular facts to the legal issue, because there really isn't a Federal interest in how this affidavit is construed or not, but in -- in the resolution of the legal issues, as in Grable, is the question of law disputed or uncertain, and the corollary to that is, does it need resolving, because that was the situation in the Grable case.   But just because an issue is novel doesn't ipso facto make it a -- a substantial issue.   This Court in the Merrell Dow case discussed that. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Why -- why do all -- why do all of these issues cut in your favor in all cases involving malpractice?   I mean, you're urging not just that your client win here, but you want us to adopt a general rule that malpractice suits involving patent rights can never, ever, come under \u201c Federal arising \u201d under jurisdiction.   Isn't that -- isn't that what you want us to say? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So the burden would be on you to show that every one of these factors in all of those cases is always going to cut in your favor.   That -- what, that they will never involve a constitutional issue?   That they will never, ever determine future patent decisions? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I -- I urge that because I think that's the only appropriate application of the Grable test to legal malpractice cases.   And it's not that-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, I like -- I like bright-line rules.   In fact -- you know, I thought Holmes had it right.   It doesn't arise under unless the cause of action is a Federal cause of action.   But once we've gone down -- down the road of Grable, I don't -- you're -- you're proving a negative.   The burden is on you to prove a negative, that there is no situation that can arise in -- in malpractice cases involving patents where the Federal issue would justify arising.   A hard road to hoe. "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --I think there are two reasons.   There are two reasons why that's the only appropriate way to apply the Grable test to legal malpractice cases, and both of them involve the lack of precedent from the case.   One is it can never involve actual patent rights.   The consequence of a judge's-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --How about fraud on -- a claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on the PTO?   Lawyer loses that.   It's been litigated.   Isn't it res judicata, and won't it affect the patent or might it not affect the patent in a patent action? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --No, Your Honor, it would not.   It would not affect the patent office either as a matter of res judicata or as a matter of issue preclusion, non-mutual issue preclusion or as a matter of jurisprudential precedence.   For a couple of reasons.   One is that as a starting point, the -- the question of attorney misconduct can affect the issuance of a patent before the patent office, but that would happen not in the context of a legal malpractice claim, but in the context of the actual prosecution of the patent before the PTO itself.   So the PTO would have made a -- its own determination and granted or not granted limited sanction, whatever action it is the PTO takes in -- before -- in a proceeding before itself, the PTO would be deciding that.   So a legal malpractice case would only be subsequent to that.   So, in -- in the first instance, the PTO gets to decide that.   From a res judicata standpoint, the PTO's patent review manual, the Manual of Examination of Patents provides that res judicata effect is only given to decisions by either the Board of Patent Review or Interferences, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and the Federal circuit.   No State courts make that list.   So from a res judicata standpoint, only going right up the chain is going to bind the PTO.   And from an issue preclusion standpoint, the PTO would never be a party, could never be a party to a -- a legal malpractice claim and, therefore, would not be bound by any State court decision.   And what's kind of a funny-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I find that somewhat hard to follow.   Let's assume in adjudicating a medical -- a malpractice claim, the State court finds that the attorney suppressed information.   It's a finding of fact.   He has this information in his or her file, and they didn't disclose it.   I'm not quite sure how the PTO ignores that litigation. "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --The PTO may not ignore it.   The PTO-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Or the district court does, if it gets to review that in a later action. "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --Well, but-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm only raising this question to address Justice Scalia's point.   You're asking for an absolute rule, and I posited a situation where I think it's not so clear that a State court finding might not have an effect.   So, do we have to go to your absolute rule? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --No, Your Honor, you do not have to go to my absolute rule.   I think that the absolute rule is the -- the most sensible and appropriate application of the Grable test to State law legal malpractice claims, and it has the added benefit of certainty.   It -- it doesn't roll us back to the Justice Holmes' rule. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I guess you might argue that even if it fails the Grable test in a couple of isolated cases, we should still adopt that rule, because the benefits of having a clear rule that doesn't have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the fact that one or two might -- might not come out that way if we applied Grable. "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Because we're making it up anyway, right? "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, I -- I would take it a step further than that, because I think that any actual impact of -- of what you're positing, Justice Sotomayor, is so ephemeral.   The idea that -- that the PTO will look at a fact-finding in a legal malpractice case, and oh, goodness, I didn't realize there was this suppression of evidence, I'm now going to dig further.   Well, that's such a speculative and ephemeral possibility, it doesn't disrupt the fabric of patent jurisprudence, patent law in any way, and it doesn't tie the hands of the PTO in any way.   It doesn't bind the PTO in any future consideration of a continuation patent or any other related continuation in part patent. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Let -- let me ask you this: The Brighton Miller treatise is rather complimentary of Grable, and said it brought considerable certainty to the area.   I was pleased to hear that because I'm not sure that it's true.   [Laughter]   But can you just tell me, as an -- as an empirical matter, does \u201c arising under \u201d for removal jurisdiction cases consume a tremendous amount of time in litigation in the Federal courts?   It's just-- "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " Well, it -- it does a couple of things.   First is, it consumes a lot of time of the courts and the litigants in removing and then getting remanded again and it -- as is discussed in the-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " --What I mean is the argument over \u201c arising under \u201d over jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --There are, on this issue of the legal malpractice cases, in the wake of the Federal Circuit's opinions, the Air Measurement case and Immunocept case in 2007, scores and scores and scores of courts, State and Federal courts, have been grappling with this precise jurisdictional issue.   I think this case is about the fifth or sixth cert petition that came up to this Court on this jurisdictional question.   I think there are three or four behind us in queue, and there continues to be uncertainty in the lower courts on this precise issue.   And it really presents for this Court a question of is \u201c arising under \u201d jurisdiction truly a lenient standard, as the Federal court has articulated.   Now, it's true that the entire body of State law legal malpractice cases arising out of patent representation is not going to overwhelm the Federal court.   It's not going to-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " So my question was even broader.   Let's say we resolve legal malpractice.   Then we will have products liability with a particular product, and then we will have some food and agriculture cases.   It goes on and on. "}, {"speaker": "Jane Webre", "text": " --I think that is a -- that is a -- that's a substantial issue.   But, like Justice Scalia said, that -- you know, this Court departed from Justice Holmes' construct some years ago.   But I think that there is the opportunity in this case to provide a great deal of certainty, to provide absolute certainty vis -- vis legal malpractice cases because of their unique hypothetical aspect.   The consequence of the judgment affects no rights.   But second, in reaffirming, rearticulating the Grable test, emphasizing the importance and the separateness of the substantiality inquiry, emphasizing the importance of the federalism aspect, this Court has a great opportunity to resolve a lot of uncertainty.   And if there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Michel.

Let me -- let me give up another scenario because in a different role when the patent is not declared invalid and instead there is a finding of non-infringement, and that's what gives rise to the legal malpractice case.   Then you go to State court, and in that situation the determination of -- of infringement will be raised as a basis for legal malpractice against the lawyer in the malpractice case.   Then the lawyers raise, as within the \u201c case within the case \u201d exception, is that, oh, the patent was invalid.   So then in that situation, a State district court will be rendering an opinion on a live patent, and then that will be binding on the inventor and will affect real live actual patents, and it does affect patents before the Patent Office.   Petitioner said we -- it's not an issue of res judicata.   They cite a rule.   That's not our argument.   It's an issue of issue preclusion.

Why don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same way in those fields? "}, {"speaker": "Thomas M.

That's why the exclusive Federal court jurisdiction.   That's why exclusive nationwide jurisdiction in patent law in the Federal Circuit is different than any other area of the law.   It is that balancing test that we are required to engage in.   That's why it's unique from antitrust, trademark, civil rights, securities, employment.   Those have concurrent jurisdiction.   They may not have an agency involved.   For example, bankruptcy initially sounds like it's exclusively Federal court issues, but when you look underneath the bankruptcy, there is core proceedings and there's non-core.   Non-core are concurrent; those could be heard in State court.   Secondly, those underlying issues in bankruptcy typically involve State property right issues anyway.   So they are really applying whether somebody has a perfected security interest lien, whether somebody has a justified debt, whether -- things of that nature.   So rather than in any other area of law, these other areas, even if they are exclusive in Federal court jurisdiction, some of those underlying issues are basically based on who the party is.   And they are still applying underlying State issues. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So your case turns on the Federal Circuit having exclusive appellate jurisdiction?

Trademark is concurrent jurisdiction.   The limited area that applies these factors, going back to the balancing test, is extremely narrow.

And so it conflates necessity with substantiality, and the -- the Texas Supreme Court followed the Federal circuit's construct.   They said, We're applying Grable, we're looking at substantiality, but then they did exactly what the Federal circuit did.   And ditto with -- with the Federalism balance.   They pointed to the needs of Federal interest in the uniformity of patent law and that was the end of the inquiry.   And I think that that is a measure of the deference that the Supreme Court of Texas, as other State courts would do, the deference they grant to the Federal circuit in deciding the question of appropriate scope of patent jurisprudence and the relative importance of the -- the uniformity of patent law.
