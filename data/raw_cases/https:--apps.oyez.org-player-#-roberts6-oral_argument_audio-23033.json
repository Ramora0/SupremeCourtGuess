The issue we bring to the Court is whether that conviction under 26 U.S.C. 7206 is an aggravated felony, specifically under (M)(i) of the aggravated felony statute.   This Court many times has held that it is the elements of the crime of conviction that determine whether a crime is an aggravated felony.   And the elements of 7206 do not change when they go over to the immigration statute.   And the terms of that statute is basically as the Department of Justice has written in its Tax Manual.   It is basically a tax perjury statute.   If you don't tell the truth, and you know what you are saying is false, and you do it under oath, that's perjury.   There are other statutes, perjury statutes, which in essence say the same thing.   And 18 U.S.C. 1001 is also a perjury statute.   And none of them require the Justice Department or a court to determine whether fraud and deceit was an element of that crime.

Now, that's the simple-minded argument, but what's wrong with it? "}, {"speaker": "Thomas J. Whalen", "text": " --What's wrong with it, Your Honor, is that what we're talking about is the aggravated felony statute.   And the issue -- and it may be a narrow one for this Court -- is whether the conviction under 7206, which does not require anything more than filing of a false statement without any intent to deceive or defraud -- whether that is an aggravated felony.   And this Court has said time and again that it's the elements of the offense that determines aggravated felony.   If I may illustrate the point, if -- if a conviction under 7206 was viewed by this Court as including fraud and deceit for the reasons many of the justices have indicated, that, you know, that when somebody writes a false tax return, it's got to be deceit, what that does is that would collaterally estop a taxpayer from denying fraud and deceit in the civil collection action.   So this is what Commissioner Walters was concerned about, why he has filed his brief, that it in effect would undermine the ability of the government to get an easy conviction based simply on a false statement.   Similarly, if you are convicted of tax evasion, the -- the tax evader cannot challenge fraud.   He is collaterally estopped.   And as we know, when the government goes to seek recovery, that is getting the taxes back in a civil proceeding, there is no statute of limitations.   The intention of Congress is also reflected in the Internal Revenue Code section 6501, where if a person is convicted under 7206 and the government seeks to collect the unpaid taxes in an assessment proceeding, Congress particularly said that where there is a conviction under 7206, the government has the burden of proving fraud, which seems to me to be evidence -- or rather, the government has the -- a duty to prove there was an attempt to evade the tax.   But the conclusion is the same.   If Congress had intended that proof of fraud and deceit would be in 7206, there would be no reason at all for congress to put that in 70 -- 6501.

I would like to move to the second part of my argument, if Your Honor please, that the -- this Court has been very clear on deciding statutes invoking the canons of construction.   And one of the important canons is that different words have different meanings.   So in (M)(i), we have loss to victim or victims in excess of $10,000.   And in (M)(ii), we have a revenue loss to the government in excess of 10,000.   And as this Court said in Nijhawan, referring to (M)(ii), this is the Internal Revenue provision, a correct assessment, I suggest, and that (M)(i) deals with injuries or damage to third parties, not to the government.   If you take the government's position that fraud and deceit crimes are in -- fraud and deceit revenue crimes are in (M)(i), then (M)(ii) would be worthless or pointless.

It would be adding to the -- to the fraud and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie.   It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing postcards saying, I know I owe money, I just ain't gonna pay it.   There is no fraud and deceit there.

From the beginning of this country -- rather, the beginning of the tax statutes, Congress has always separated revenue statutes from other crimes.

As a factual matter, it so happens that most of those cases will often involve some concealment along the way.   If somebody's taking more than $10,000 in gold coins out of the country to take them to a Swiss bank, they often don't mention that when they are leaving the country.

"}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well, certainly in the context of the civil tax fraud penalty, the Tax Court has concluded that intent to evade is synonymous with an understatement due to fraud.   And the reason why it has refused to reach that conclusion in the context of 7206 offenses, like the ones at issue in this case, is because the 7206 offense does not require the government to prove that there was any understatement to begin with, And so there could not have been an understatement due to fraud.   I'd also note that it is not at all clear that in the context of the evasion of payment cases that I was just discussing in the context of tax evasion, that the same civil tax fraud penalty would be applicable there, because the civil tax fraud penalty is triggered by an understatement of an amount required to be shown on the return.   And therefore if it is -- if it isn't actually something that is done in the context of filing a tax return that understates how much you owe the government, then -- then that may well not trigger the collateral estoppel effect in the follow-on civil case.

Parts of 7204, which is failing to furnish a statement to the employee reflecting the amount of taxes, but not -- but then again, I think it could be divisible because it would also apply to furnishing a false statement to your employee.   Even the misdemeanor offense under 7207 for presenting false documents might be covered for fraud or deceit, but in practice it's only used when there's -- it's only used when the tax deficiencies are de minimis.

And I think that in context, the reference to a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax is not something that clearly connotes that Congress is just speaking to 7206 offenses.   It uses not only the word fraudulent, but also the intent to evade tax, which I think-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, no, but I think your friend's argument, which had some appeal, is 7206 is fraud and false statements.

So the next provision also applies more broadly to 7201 and more closely tracks the definition in 7201.   So I think just like the statute of limitations provision that we note, Congress is probably using a belt and suspenders approach there.   That we noted that Congress may well have had reason to be concerned that 7201 offenses would not necessarily be seen as having fraud or deceit as an element of the offense, in light of this Court's decision in Scharton, which was an old case but it had said that in the -- in the statute of limitations context, that the -- the extended statute of limitations that apply to offenses in which fraud was an element, was not triggered by the statutory predecessor to tax evasion.

In addition I would-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --I mean, the paradoxical thing about your argument is that one, it makes us think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that maybe there was going to be some conviction out there that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress is being super-careful about this.

And so subparagraph (A) refers to murder and rape; those would also generally be covered in crimes of violence in subparagraph (F).

And I think that virtually all of those offenses would have been included within (K)(i) but Congress wanted to be sure and therefore added (K)(ii); and as -- as Justice Breyer pointed out I think before, textually it -- it had reason to think that 7206 would be picked up by fraud or deceit here-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But 7206 is the lesser offense.

And so the cases that Petitioners invoke here in order to establish that there is a category that is being pulled out of (M)(i) are HCSC-Laundry and Leocal.   Those are both cases in which the statute actually identified the category of offenses in question, whether it was the cooperative hospital service organizations in HCSC-Laundry or DUI offenses in Leocal.

That -- did Congress really mean to turn misdemeanors into aggravated felons?   And then there was a very practical point made that government is going to be hurt more than helped by what you are seeking, because we are told that very often the government will try to make a bargain.   It has a 7201 case, but it's going to be a little hard to prove.   So they offer as a plea bargain 7206.   And if you -- if your position prevails, we are told, there will be many, many people who will say: If it's a question of whether I get thrown out of the United States, I'm going to go to trial; I'm not going to plead to something that will mean immediately when I serve my time I will be thrown out of the United States.

In most instances where somebody lies to an FBI agent, probably don't involve costing somebody more than $10,000.   And so I think that it doesn't often come up in (M)(i).   But many other tax offenses are prosecuted under other provisions that potentially involve fraud or deceit and could cost the government more than $10,000.   And Petitioner's reading of saying that all tax offenses have to be pulled into (M)(ii) and only tax evasion is covered would require the Court to bifurcate all of these other provisions.   instance, 18 U.S.C. 371.   And I'm thinking of, for This is the provision for defrauding the United States by obstructing or impeding the IRS in its efforts to collect taxation.   This Court cited 371 as one of the fraud offenses that it thought was covered by (M)(i) in the Nijhawan decision.   same is true for mail fraud.   The The criminal division, the tax division can prosecute tax cases in which somebody mails a false tax return under 18 U.S.C. 1341.   False claims under 18 U.S.C. 287; conspiracy to false claims under 286; false statements to the government, these are all provisions that are used to prosecute tax offenses.   And Petitioner's reading of saying that all tax crimes are culled out would require the Court to bifurcate these offenses and make whether it's an aggravated felony turn on whether the government has lost revenue as opposed to some other form of money.   And we don't think that that's what Congress intended when it went to the trouble of just stating that tax evasion was expressly covered.   And going back, Justice Kagan, to your concerns about superfluidity, I do think it's important that in the context of this statute, there's lots of other overlap.   Congress had reasons to be unsure.   In light of the Scharton decision, in light of the evasion-of-payment cases because even though as a factual matter-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But It would have been perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which said just in case that -- you know, just in case this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that appears to exclude all other tax offenses.

Gannon", "text": " --I don't see how -- if Congress wanted to exclude all other tax offenses, I think they should have put that exception in (M)(i).   have said: They should Offenses involving fraud or deceit, but not tax offenses, in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.

I agree that the Court avoids superfluidity where it can.   contextual reasons to think that Congress was just trying to add more offenses to the definition rather than rule out an entire class.   And I also think that there is no way to avoid the consequence of bifurcating all of those other provisions under Petitioner's reading.   And so if you were to say that the reference to 7201 pulls out all revenue loss offenses, that would mean that some mail fraud cases against the government in which the government loses more than $10,000 count and some don't.   statements.

Why -- or why did it say an -- an offense that involves -- an offense in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and one involves fraud or deceit; or two, is described in section 7201 of Title 26?   I mean, if -- if you read it, it seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with revenue loss to the government.   And I find it hard to regard the government as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the truth. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " --None of the courts of appeals has had any difficulty concluding that the government is a victim when it loses more than $10,000 in a fraud case, or indeed in a tax evasion case.   So here, there is a different phrase, but I think what's important is that 7201 doesn't define a class of revenue loss offenses.   offenses.   Instead, it defines a class of tax evasion It only refers to the one statute.   And -- and then in that context, where there has to be a deficiency in order to -- for there to be a 7201 conviction, there must be a tax deficiency.   Then it is natural to talk about the relevant losses being revenue loss to the government.   The phrase in (M)(i) is broader because it also applies to other types of frauds.   And I think that the reference to 7201 alone doesn't indicate Congress is intending to weed out all tax offenses.   As Justice Ginsburg mentioned before, although 7201 has a 5-year maximum statutory penalty, which is longer than the 3-year maximum that applies under 7206 and some of the other tax offenses in that particular chapter of Title 26, as a practical matter, the -- the sentencing guidelines use the same thing.   The -- the same criteria that are both tied to loss.   And more importantly, a lot of these other offenses, like 371 and 1341 and 1343 in Title 18 actually have longer maximum punishments.   So if the government wants -- has a particularly big fraud that they want to -- to get after somebody who has a tax evasion case in which they've cost the government a great deal of money -- it may choose to proceed under one of the other provisions where it can get an even greater punishment.   And so just referring to 7201 as the capstone I don't think allows it to be a stand-in for all other tax offenses.

And so, I -- I think even though it's an aiding and abetting, it's not a classic aiding and abetting violation that depends on the -- the husband's conviction.   She could have been convicted under 7206, too, even if the husband didn't know anything about the false numbers that she was providing him from the restaurant that they were operating.

Similarly, the Harry Bridges case, also decided by this Court, said that -- and the Court held that making a false statement about Mr. Bridges' involvement with the Communist Party is not evidence of fraud.   These cases, I believe of this Court, control the issue that deceit or fraud is not an essential element for this crime of conviction.   Following up what Justice Kagan has said, has asked, that the rules -- canons of construction that the Petitioner has invoked, the rules of superfluities -- again superfluities -- the idea that a court must give cognizance to different words meaning different things -- that is, revenue loss from the government is different from revenue loss to victim or victims, and the specific versus the general.   The answer of the government is simply speculation and conjecture of, among other things, courts make the wrong decisions, Congress didn't understand that tax evasion does involve fraud, and therefore, it will be superfluous.
