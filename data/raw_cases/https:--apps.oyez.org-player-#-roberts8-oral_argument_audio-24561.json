[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 16-1435, Minnesota Voters Alliance versus Mansky. Mr. Breemer. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Minnesota's statute bans all conventional political expression on apparel to prevent a smaller class of material that can already be regulated under other election statutes.   Shirts saying AFL-CIO, Chamber of Commerce, Moveon.cor -- Moveon.org -- excuse me -- and countless other examples are prohibited. Since a vast amount of the banned material is legitimate speech and the statute has plain -- a few plainly justified applications, it is overbroad and unconstitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Which -- which are those -- which are the -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I was just going to ask you -- I was just going to ask you, those examples you gave, in your view, could be prohibited by a properly drawn statute? Moveon.org and so forth you say could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " They can -- they are prohibited.   They are prohibited. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Could they be prohibited under a statute that was more narrowly drawn? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, I do not think they could.   Under any test, that type of generalized political expression, associations, NAACP, countless others, could -- could not be. And that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Do you think more -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Could you clarify the procedural posture of this case? I gather the first time around you went to the Eighth Circuit and they rejected the facial challenge, but they sent it back on as-applied.   District court said as-applied is also dismissed.   Then it went back to the Eighth Circuit. So what -- are we dealing with a facial challenge, are we dealing with an as-applied challenge? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " It's solely a facial challenge, Your Honor.   The as-applied claims were not appealed and they're not before the Court.   So the only question is whether this statute on its face violates the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine.   And it does violate the First Amendment doctrine -- First Amendment overbreadth doctrine because it sweeps in so much political expression in association that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Do you -- do you think, Mr. Breemer, that a statute could target only electoral speech, in other words, \"Clinton for President,\" \"Trump for President,\" that sort of thing? Could a statute say that that speech cannot be worn in the polling place? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes, a statute does say that.   In Minnesota, the first sentence of this statute -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " No, I know.   But it -- could a statute constitutionally say that? If it were limited to that, would that be permissible, or is it impermissible? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, it's a very close call, but it's not one that this Court has to make in this particular case. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I know, but I'm just asking your view. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " I honestly don't know, Your Honor, whether that -- that line is so close, but the statute here, the first sentence, already prohibits that material, and it's unchallenged, that particular sentence here.   And even assuming you could ban advocacy expression, this statute goes so far to take in so much material that isn't advocacy, that is simply self-expression of personal values and associations.   So I agree it's a tough -- a very tough call, but it's not one this Court has to decide. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, but it -- but it's important for us if -- we're going to have to write an opinion on this.   You say, well, I don't know, I don't know. (Laughter.)

As I mentioned before, the statute -- the first sentence already bans that, and so I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " We're asking about a hypothetical case.   Could a statute that was limited to that be upheld? And would it be constitutional in your view? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, I don't think it would be.   I don't think it would be. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "J.

David Breemer", "text": " Well, as we read Burson, it didn't deal with the passive wearing of a -- any kind of apparel, campaign or more general political apparel.   It dealt with active campaigning and material used in conjunction with that conduct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's the line you're drawing? Because someone puts something on instead of handing it around, that's the line you want us to draw? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Well, that's part of the line.   It's not -- the passive nature of the material undercuts the state's interest in claiming that it's disruptive, but it's also -- also intimidating speech can -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. -- Mr. Breemer -- "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- passive versus active sounds a lot like the act/omission distinction, and that has proven to be one of the most slippery concepts in all of law. Is it an act to put on a button or is it an omission to not speak about what's on the button? A T-shirt, you say, is passive.   What if it were instead a sign on my head, you know, flashing lights? Is that active or is that passive? How are we supposed to police the line you're -- you're suggesting? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Well, what I'm suggesting, Your Honor, is that the line is already policed.   All the government's interests that it's claiming in polling places are already regulated by other statutes.   For instance, Minnesota's anti-intimidation statute, Section 211B.07, could be utilized to get at intimidating and threatening messages in the polling place.   Similarly -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " They -- they talk about other interests, like decorum and dignity, and those aren't addressed by the other statutes. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, they're not -- well, they are addressed by Section 2 -- 204C.06, Your Honor, which prohibits disorderly conduct and interference -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, there's a difference between interference with someone's right to vote or disorderly conduct and -- and decorum.   They're not -- they're not the same.   Decorum, obviously, reaches further than you can't intimidate someone. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes, it probably would, Your Honor.   That's true.   But there's no right to vote -- as far as I understand it, the right to vote free of intimidation, but there's not a right to vote free of being bothered at all. Polling places are not pristine retreats from the real world, and I don't believe the government can sacrifice the First Amendment to make them that way. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, you -- you say that, but I wonder if the state can make an opposite determination and say, you know, for however many months we've had this, you know, maybe bitter, sharp, political campaign going on, and maybe, just before you cast your vote, you should be able to have a time for some quiet reflection or to do that important civic obligation in peace and quiet without being bombarded by another campaign display. And it -- you know, you say these are -- it's passive but not active, but, you know, a picture can be worth a thousand words, and people's apparel can convey very strong and shocking images that maybe the state can decide that, just before you cast your vote, you should have at least a moment free of all the Sturm und Drang of the campaign. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " That -- that's true. And there are legitimate interests in the polling place.   The problem here is that most of the material that it wants to get at, if not all of it, is already covered.   And the small amount that you're suggesting is not covered -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But you've answered -- you've answered that it's already covered, but it's no good. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " You've said it's no good. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Excuse me, I'm sorry.   I didn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You said the coverage was no good, that you could not cover. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " If I'm -- yes, Your Honor.   If I'm pressured to make the call on -- on whether you could constitutionally proscribe campaign apparel, specifically advocacy apparel, I would say no. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, you're pressured to come -- "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " But the statute here goes far beyond that. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " -- you're pressured to come up with a workable rule to guide us when we write this decision. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And you're -- you're telling, in response to the Chief Justice, basically, that the state's interest in -- in -- in decorum and solemnity and the dignity of the voting process cannot be protected by rules relating to buttons and apparel. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " I'm saying, Your Honor, that it -- it's not reasonably protected in this instance because it sweeps in so much material that's not reasonably related to those interests -- interests. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, suppose we think that it would be a different case and that a state could have a law that prohibits the wearing of buttons or any other -- or attire that contains the name of a candidate or refers to a ballot issue or the name of a political party that has candidates running for office in that election. If we thought that that would be consistent with the First Amendment, would that doom your case or would you still have additional arguments? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, that -- Your Honor, that is one place where you can draw the line. And if the line is drawn there, this statute still fails.   It's still overbroad because it sweeps in so much other -- all political -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and what would be the justification for that line, in your view? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Well, the justification for -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " In other words, why would we put one -- all the materials that Justice Alito talked about on one side of the line and all the materials that you think a state cannot restrict on the other side of the line? In your view, what's the difference? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " I think that you could arguably conclude that that type of apparel is reasonably related to the government's legitimate interest in preventing undue influence in polling places, but shirts that simply say AFL-CIO, Chamber of Congress, NAACP, those are not related to the government's interests in -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How about issues on the ballot? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, I would -- that would be -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So let's talk about a fiscal matter.   Could someone then wear a button or a shirt or could the state ban a button or a shirt that said \"Restrain Government Spending\"? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, Your Honor, I don't believe it could, because the connection is so -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I think your adversary says they can because it's a political issue display. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " That's correct.   I think they do -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And that's where you say they can't? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No.   We say -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Even though that's on the ballot? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " A fiscal issue? I think the connection would be too attenuated because then you could extrapolate forever. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " To you.   But do you think a reasonable observer would think it's too attenuated? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " I think a -- yes, I do think a reasonable observer would not see generalized political apparel as an influencing towards something on the ballot.   And that's the problem with this statute.   It seeks to silence so much peaceful conventional messaging by the blunt means of -- of outlying everything. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can you -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But they have a statute that covered one thing that is in this case, it's not hypothetical, it doesn't have to do with an issue on the ballot, but the \"Please ID Me,\" the \"Please ID Me\" button, which was challenged and then you chose not to pursue that. But what is your position on that? Could a legitimately challenged statute stop you from having the \"Please ID Me\" button? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes, it could.   And I think that Minnesota's anti-deception, anti-fraud statute that's already on the books could be used -- could have been used and could be in the future, if similar circumstances come up, could be used to deal with that button. That's Section 20 -- 211B.07 again.   That's the anti-intimidation statute. There is also a fraud statute, which is 204C.035.   All the government's interests can be already addressed through its election statutes.   And that's what makes this statute so overbroad, is that it's trying -- they're trying to get at a small slice of potentially uncovered material by banning all political expression in association, even items that don't go to ballot issues, that don't go to candidates, that are just personal expression of political beliefs and political values. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It -- it just is a little bit hard, Mr. Breemer, to evaluate an argument of overbreadth unless we have a clear view from you as to how far you think a state could go. So I'm not sure that you've given us that view.   I mean, are you -- do you want to accept Justice Alito's suggestion, or do you want to draw the line at some other place so that we know, okay, that's permissible, this is impermissible, how does this relate to that? That's the usual way overbreadth analysis goes. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   And it's -- it's -- it's very difficult, given the range of available material that's out there and the number of interests the government has here, to be able to put every item in the -- in the appropriate box.   I think it's very hard to draw a line, other than drawing a line through this particular sentence, which would allow the government to continue to pursue its interests but accommodate free speech.   I agree -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, if -- if the Court is concerned about preserving the dignity and the decorum and the solemnity of the voting process, and the statute is as difficult as you say, isn't that an argument for allowing good faith determination on a case-by-case basis by the polling officials? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, I wouldn't say that, Your Honor, because, in the meantime, free speech would be chilled.   All -- all the conventional political expression in association that no reasonable person would see as a threat to the polling place would be chilled in the process, as it's being chilled right now and will continue to be chilled unless this statute is invalidated. So I agree that it's a possible line to draw at advocacy material, but, in any event, the statute would fail because it still sweeps in the rest of the conventional type -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If -- if that were where we drew the line, I mean, what -- what would be encompassed in advocacy material? Would it be only things that named a candidate's name? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Your Honor, I think it would be anything that said for or against a candidate or an issue directly on the ballot. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " How about if it said \"Resist\"? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " I think that would be constitutionally permitted, and should be, and -- and generalized slogans -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " \"Make America Great Again\"? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " That type of slogan, too, I think that should be constitutionally permissible.   Any -- call it generalized -- otherwise, you start to bleed over and pretty soon you have the problem that we have here of discretionary enforcement and you're swallowing all this other legitimate speech when you're trying to just stop that type of advocacy material. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Why should there be speech inside the election booth at all, or inside the -- what you call the election room? Let's -- let's say that it's a small room.   Why should there be any speech there at all? You're there -- you're there to vote. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Your Honor, because the First Amendment doesn't stop at the polling place door, even -- even if it's a non -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " That's one of the questions in the case.   What's your cite -- citation for that? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " \"Jews for Jesus,\" Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Was it an airport? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " It was an airport.   It was a non-public forum, Your Honor.   That's why I'm referring to -- that's why I'm referring to it. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Justice Kennedy asked the question, could a state say that the polling place is off limits to any kind of advocacy or promotion of any point of view? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " A state could say that, yes, Your Honor, and Minnesota has said that. I'm sorry if I misunderstood.   I thought your question was whether you could create an entirely First Amendment-free zone in the polling place.   And -- and my answer to that would be, no, you -- you can't. And this gets close to a First Amendment-free zone because political speech is such a core part of the First Amendment that it's a political speech-free zone.   And while you may be able -- the government may be able to ban a certain small class of material, for instance, the advocacy material, it couldn't sweep in all the rest of the available political speeches out there, \"Resist\" shirts, \"Me Too\" and so on.   But that's exactly what it's doing here.   It's trying to silence all this legitimate speech by -- to -- to go after a small slice that it can already regulate under its other statutes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So what -- what do you put in what the state can do in addition to vote for candidate X or vote against proposition Y? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " As a bright-line rule, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't see any other feasible bright line.   I think that the state would have to -- if there's an intimidating message that comes in, I think the state would have to deal with that on an as-applied basis, as -- as events occur under its existing statutes like such -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You took the position that \"Me Too\" -- \"Please ID Me\" wasn't intimidating. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, Your Honor, I don't think I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Or that it was free speech that should not be stifled, correct? Are you changing your mind on that now? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No.   Our position was that, as pure speech, just the words on that button were -- yes, it was protected speech, that's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So there's always line-drawing.   Whether you call it intimidating speech or not, someone's going to have to draw a line. So going back to Justice Kennedy's point, why, if this is not a public forum, why can't the state reasonably draw the line at saying political speech of any kind can be potentially intimidating in a voting place and we won't permit it? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " I think the -- the -- the reason is that the First Amendment continues, as I mentioned before, continues to apply in polling places.   And once we start to create these -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It does.   You can vote.   That's the permitted act, political activity. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Correct.   And, Your Honor, that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So it's not all that's being -- "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " There -- there's an -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I mean, I suspect that on a military base we would say it would be okay for the Army to say on military grounds we're not going to permit political speech. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Well, I'm not quite sure about that, Your Honor, because, in Greer, in the Greer decision, the Court said that conventional political speech would not be banned. This Court has never upheld a prohibition on political speech as broad as this.   And there's not -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Have we ever said that it would be permissible to ban all political speech on military ground? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, Your Honor.   In -- in Greer, the Court said that conventional political speech was -- continued to be permitted.   And -- and so I guess the answer to the question is that this Court has never upheld a prohibition this broad in -- even in non-public forums, even on a military reservation, in an airport, in a school.   In Cohen, Tinker, in Greer, in all these cases, the Court wasn't willing to draw a line -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Because there was not a state interest that would permit it? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Well, that's -- that's correct.   It -- there wasn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It wasn't a state interest, but here there is a state interest that was recognized in Burson as being quite important and very legitimate? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " It's true, they are important interests, and -- and we don't deny that.   The problem is that the means being used is such a blunt means that it's swallowing a lot -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " You're -- you're -- "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " -- of political expression that doesn't have a reasonable connection to those particular interests, like simply wearing a shirt that identifies an organization that has political views or a hat or any other sort of apparel that simply identifies the wearer's personal beliefs. A lot of this material is not worn as advocacy or to influence but simply as self-expression on the day of election when people want to express their own political views when everyone is talking about them and -- and wear them in.   So that type of material, I don't believe we -- our position is it cannot be banned even under the -- the most lenient test because it's not related to these interests. Now there's some -- is some material, threatening, intimidating material, threats to particular classes, that could be under Minnesota's anti-intimidation statute, but the problem here -- we have here is that the statute doesn't stop there. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What about the -- the concern about coordination? You know, whatever the group is, you know, a big employer, the union, teachers, whatever, say we're all going to show up and we're all going to have, you know, these -- these buttons on or whatever, and maybe you're a member of the group and you don't agree with the position and you'll feel some pressure to transform your speech from what you really would like to say or you wouldn't like to say anything about it, yet you're going to be identified; because you don't have our button, you're not doing what you should be doing to support the group. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   And if that situation did come up, it could be addressed under Section 204C.06, which prohibits voter interference and disorderly conduct and loitering in the polling place. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but nobody would say that it's interference or disorderly conduct.   It's subtle psychological pressure.   I don't think that would be covered by any of those other statutory provisions. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " And in that case, Your Honor, then it would be -- could be dealt with on an as-applied basis as the circumstances come up, if it crosses the line between -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " As-applied under what? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " -- speech and conduct. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Under what? You have to have a statute to apply. "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Yes.   And I -- and I'm still referring to the other statutes that could be addressed as an as-applied challenge under those situations -- under those existing statutes because it's crossing the line.   In that kind of situation, it would cross the line between speech and conduct.   And once you cross the line between speech and conduct -- or speech and electioneering, if you draw the line at advocacy, it would cross the line between electioneering, either one of those, and then you could deal with it on that situation. I would mention, though, it is -- it is -- it is a fact that that type of behavior is already not allowed in polling places because of the other interests in statutes in there that try to keep it in a -- in a -- quiet decorum and limiting people for only the purpose of going in and out of the polling place. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " How many other states have laws that go as far as Minnesota's? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " Your Honor, we believe -- nine is our estimate.   And the remainder deal with electioneering.   They stop at electioneering at the advocacy material that we were discussing before.   So there's nine states that have similar to this, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And what has been the experience of these other cases -- these other states? Have they had brawls in the -- in the polling place? Have they had disturbances in the polling place? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " No, Your Honor, there's no evidence of -- of disruption either in Minnesota or these other states caused by simply wearing -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, the states that don't have laws that go as far as Minnesota's, what -- what has been the record there? "}, {"speaker": "J. David Breemer", "text": " As far as I know, Your Honor -- it's not in this record.   As far as I know, that they -- that there hasn't been any instances of a disruption caused by people wearing apparel, except for when polling workers confront people wearing apparel and then stop the process to try and police their clothes. And that's part of the problem here, is that disruption and intimidation is often going to occur through the policing of someone's shirt, not through the fact that they're passively wearing it as they go in and out of the polling place. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And does the record show how many officials would be making these determinations at a general election in Minnesota and how they're selected?

We know that there's more than one. We also know that there's -- there's other officials sometimes that go in there. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

There were local elections.   There was one ballot question.

"}, {"speaker": "Daniel Rogan", "text": " -- beyond expressed advocacy that is -- that would be defined as -- as campaign speech.   And I think that the -- the First Amendment issue here, as -- as my friend has described it, is whether or not there is any ability to ban what they call passive speech. The line that they've drawn here is not one about campaign speech or political speech or the way that -- that this Court has described it, which is that there are instances where you can ban any type of speech, including on this Court's plaza, where any speech or any message on a banner, flag, or device is prohibited. Those are the types -- it's clear that this Court has allowed the states to prohibit what they call passive speech, and instead of describing what the category is of speech, whether it's campaign, political, or all speech, their rule is, if it's on a T-shirt, it doesn't matter what it says, that you can wear it in a polling place. And that was squarely rejected in Burson.   And it was for the reasons that it impacts the integrity of the election by having political or campaign speech and it impacts the decorum and solemnity of the polling place to have that type of speech in the -- in the polling place.

Because, I mean, there are clearly some places where we think -- you know, the courtroom is a good example, where we don't want anybody to be wearing buttons or wearing shirts of -- of the kind that you're talking about. But why should a polling place be that sort of place? In other words, you talk about the decorum, the solemnity.   Makes it sound a little bit church-like. Why is a polling place that? Why isn't it just the culmination of what is often a rowdy political process? "}, {"speaker": "Daniel Rogan", "text": " So for two reasons, Your Honor.   I think -- I think the rowdy political process ends before you get into the polling place so that we can have an election that has integrity, that citizens -- we have to -- what we're doing is we're taking the citizens' decisions about who to vote for and turning it into electoral choices. And for that process to have integrity, the beginning of the process, the act of voting itself, has to have integrity. And the integrity is not just actual integrity that somebody -- that everybody who is entitled to vote was able to vote.   It has to be perceived as having integrity. And one of the problems with allowing campaign or political material into the polling place is it creates a perception problem.   The example is, if you have two people, one wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and one not wearing one -- in Minnesota, we have challengers who can challenge the eligibility of someone to vote.   If somebody challenges the \"Make America Great Again\" voter but not the other voter, the perception is, did they do that because of partisan reasons? How about the election judge who asks extra questions of the person wearing the \"Make America Great Again\" hat? Are they being singled out because of their political message?

And as you had earlier asked, the -- the way that this process works is that there are at least four poll workers in every single precinct in Minnesota, and when they're busy, there are more.   And they are from different political parties. And so any viewpoint discrimination that -- that -- that could occur is likely to be self-corrected by others in the polling place.

And I think, you know, one of the things that -- that -- that I think is important to understand is election judges have discretion to make a lot of different decisions in polling places.   In Minnesota, we have same-day registration.   They make decisions about whether or not somebody's qualified, has -- has met their requirements to -- to register. We also have challenge voters, when somebody is challenged because for -- are they a felon or are they somehow not eligible to vote, the election judge puts them under oath and asks them questions and makes a determination about whether or not they're eligible to vote. So the idea that -- that making a -- a -- a decision about whether or not something is political or not is well within the understanding of -- of a -- of an election judge in Minnesota.   And I think that the -- the important issue here is the state's interest is the fundamental right to vote. This isn't just prohibiting speech in the -- at the DMV or at the post office.   This is an election process that is incredibly important to democracy.   It's incredibly important to the electoral branches of government to make sure that it has the integrity that's required so that when individuals are elected, that they have the legitimacy that's required to make sure that citizens believe that they are the rightful decision-makers.

And I think to -- to go back to the -- the question of line-drawing, line-drawing happens every single time when there's a content-based restriction.   And the fact that there are hard calls at the edges of the line, at the margin, doesn't mean that the line that was drawn is unreasonable.   All that it means is that there are hard cases.

And it's -- and it makes it so that the voting process is one that Minnesotans can be proud of.   We often lead the nation in electoral turnout.   We have elections that have a high degree of integrity.   We've had multiple state-wide recounts that have not had any issues regarding whether or not somebody was -- whether or not political material was -- was in the polling place.

Their position for seven years has been it covers all political views.   And I believe they said that here as well.   And the Election Day policy and both the statute are clear that it covers everything political.   There's no qualification on the term \"political.\" As-applied challenges, to deal with this, would result in an endless series of adjudications, either in the polling place itself or in courts later on.   And in the meantime, legitimate protected speech and self-expression, like the Second Amendment on a shirt, would be chilled.   And that's the purpose of the overbreadth doctrine.
