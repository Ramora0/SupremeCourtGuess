[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 20-1410, Ruan versus United States, and the consolidated case. Mr. Robbins. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Dr. Xiulu Ruan's jury was instructed that it could convict him of federal narcotics offenses if he prescribed \"outside the usual course of professional medical practice.\" The Eleventh Circuit sustained that instruction precisely because it \"told the jury that good faith was a defense\" as long as the appellant's conduct also was in accordance with the standards of medical practice.   In other words, good faith is a defense in the Eleventh Circuit only for doctors whose prescriptions are already lawful. No lawyer will stand up before the Court this morning and defend either that instruction or the court of appeals's rationale. And small wonder.   Dr. Ruan received little more than the instruction he would have gotten had this been a civil malpractice action in Alabama. So, in our view, Dr. Ruan's case must be remanded, and on remand, the Eleventh Circuit should either dismiss this prosecution outright for want of sufficient proof of Alabama substantive standards or, at a minimum, order a new trial on all counts, this time governed by the correct scienter rule.   And that rule, we submit, which largely tracks the law in the First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits, is that a doctor may not be convicted under Section 841(a)(1) unless the government proves that her prescriptions were made without a good-faith medical purpose. The good-faith medical purpose test makes the best sense of the statutory text, this Court's case law.   It also accords with principles of federalism that are embedded in the statute itself, enables the jury to focus on the question of intent, as it always does in criminal cases, and affords an appropriate berth for doctors and patients to make the best choices for the individual care of what is often invisible and yet real and intractable pain. I'd be pleased to hear the Court's questions at this time.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Just a couple of sort of housekeeping questions.   Could you explain to me exactly what the offense is here that the government is prosecuting? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " The principal offense, Justice Thomas, is 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), which is the -- the -- the principal narcotics distribution statute, and certain associated statutes that use the drug offense as part of the compound proof.   So there's a racketeering charge, there's a money laundering charge. All these -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Okay.   So let's just stick with the first one.   But there's nothing in there -- there's an exception, right, to 841? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes, the \"except as authorized\" exception.   Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Okay.   So does the government have -- when the government indicts, does it have -- have to plead the exception? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " No.   I think, under Section 885, it is not required to plead it. That is to say, the statute provides, Your Honor, that there is an obligation of the defense to put the question at issue, but, once the defense does so, the circuits are unanimous, and I -- I think correctly so, that it then falls to the government to prove the absence of good faith beyond a reasonable doubt according to whatever the legal standard for good faith is. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So where -- where does that come from, the -- the -- the legal standard you're talking about, in order to be register -- to be exempt from 841? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " The legal standard, as -- as I understand it, Your Honor, comes from the fact that the statute has an embedded exception for physicians. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I understand that part, I'm sorry.   Does it come from a statute or a regulation? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " The ex- -- the -- the obligation to prove good faith? "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " No, the -- the standard for the exception in order to be registered, to not be covered, because 841 is a broad statute, right? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " 841 is a narcotics felony. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I know.   So it covers everybody.   So, if you just looked at that, a doctor would be covered? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes.   We don't dispute that a doctor -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Now, but where does this standard -- in order to comply with the exception, the authorization to write prescriptions, where does that standard come from? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " The standard comes from, I suggest, Justice Thomas, the presumption of scienter and the principle articulated in several of this Court's cases we cite that says in substance that a scienter standard, which is presumed and, of course, in this statute actually is express, knowingly or intentionally -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I thought there were standards that were set out by regulation on how a doctor was to conduct his or her affairs in writing these prescriptions. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " To -- well, the -- the -- the -- the Controlled Substances Act largely leaves that to states and administrative boards. There aren't lots of explicit obligations built into the statute itself. On the other hand, the argument we are making today takes the \"knowingly\" and \"intentionally\" language in the statute and asks, to what elements does that apply? We contend that it applies to the \"except as authorized\" language in the statute.   And -- and so you begin with the presumption.   You have the statute saying \"knowingly\" and \"intentionally,\" so you don't have to even read that in, as this Court has done in other cases.   And then the only question is, where does it apply? And the only element, Justice Thomas, the only element that could possibly separate innocent from wrongful conduct is the \"except as authorized\" language.   Nothing else can possibly make sense.

Robbins", "text": " Well, it -- it depends -- the answer is no, you don't get an instruction that says you can pick the rules you like, no.   What -- but the instruction that we're urging, which we think, by the way, follows from this Court's scienter case law, doesn't create, I -- I -- I suggest, Mr. Chief Justice, it does not create some freestanding, you know, choose your own medicine rule. What it does is it tells the jury focus on intent.   Focus on purpose.   You are free as a member of the jury to disbelieve the doctor's profession -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

The -- the -- the fact is this -- you know, speeding is the classic case of a regulatory offense, the sort of, you know, situation in which scienter isn't even an issue.   You don't get to defend the traffic violation based on your state of mind. But, when you're talking about sending doctors or anybody for that matter to jail for mandatory minimums of decades in prison, this is not a regulatory offense.   This is an offense as to which this Court's case law on -- on scienter applies with the most robust force it could.

Robbins", "text": " -- I -- I take -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- can -- can we separate out two issues: good faith, which goes to the extent of the knowledge, and the actual conduct that the government must prove. Now I understood as I read this that 841(a) says the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a doctor intentionally prescribed or distributed controlled substances, and you're saying doctors can do that, so the only way they can't do it is if they prescribe it other than for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, no.   Well, I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, you want to say something more, but I think that's what the statute says.   The statute, by its words, says, putting in the exception, the government has to prove that he didn't do it for a medical purpose and in the normal course of business. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " I -- I think that's the very least they have to prove, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's the least. Now the question becomes, who has the burden of proving or not good faith, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, that -- that's not -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You say it's the government. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S.

Everybody will concede -- if you ask my friend, Mr. Feigin, he will tell you that once the issue is put in play under 885, it then falls to the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, but I'd like to go -- the absence of good faith. But I'd like to go back to where Your Honor began her question because you said were -- the words knowingly and intentionally must prescribe outside the bounds of medicine and without a medical purpose. It is important for me to be clear that my client didn't get that instruction.   His jury was told, if he was outside the bounds of medicine, you may convict him, full stop.   No good faith.   No knowingly or intentionally. None of that. So I want to be clear that the premise of Your Honor's question is a premise under which our conviction should be reversed. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S.

"}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I do have a number of questions, Mr. Robbins.   We're interpreting a statute, so we should start by looking at what the statute says, and it says, \"except as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to\" do a variety of things. As a matter of language, do the adverbs \"knowingly\" or \"intentionally\" modify the introductory clause \"except as authorized by this subchapter\"? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " The answer is yes, Justice Alito, and I'd be happy to explain why I think so. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I think my old English teacher would say no, you've gotten that answer wrong.   There's no way they can modify \"except as authorized by this subchapter.\" They modify what comes later.   But explain to me why they modify it as a matter of language, not as a matter of constitutional avoidance or something like that. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " No, and I'm not arguing constitutional avoidance.   I am arguing the principles of -- of -- that this Court has articulated in Rehaif and other cases.   But let's just talk about language. Obviously, it's a -- I -- I hate to use the word holistic, but it's a holistic endeavor.   The government says it only modifies the verbs that come next.   That proposition you've already rejected. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, we rejected it in a particular case for particular reasons, but I want to forget about all that.   I just want to start out with English grammar. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Okay.   Well, I'm not sure grammar alone will do the trick. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " But -- but -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- we'll move beyond grammar.   So you want to say that whether or not \"knowingly\" and \"intentionally\" modify \"except as authorized by this subchapter,\" that is an element of the offense? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " It -- yes, it is. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And, therefore -- and there's a presumption of scienter as to every element of an offense? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " No, I wouldn't say that. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " If it -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I thought that was your argument.   No? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, there's a presumption as to any element that separates wrongful from innocent conduct.   I would not, for example, quarrel with the -- with the holding in -- in Yermian that a jurisdictional path is different. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   So a non-jurisdictional -- as to a non-jurisdictional element, there is a presumption -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- of scienter? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Why is there a presumption that the scienter here is knowingly or intentionally as opposed to, say, recklessly? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Because it's in the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But, if linguistically they do not modify that clause, then why would you jump over recklessness to knowingly and intentionally? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, again, I -- I -- I -- I don't mean to be disputatious, but I don't accept the proposition that they don't as -- just as -- as grammar is best understood, I think they do modify the predicate language. And let me -- let me give you -- make a slightly different point, Justice Alito. Twenty years -- or, actually, 20 -- you know, roughly 25 years after 841(a)(1) was enacted, Justice Alito, Congress enacted 841(h), which is the provision -- subsection that deals with Internet sales of narcotics. There, you will see that they took the phrase \"except as authorized\" and they moved it later, which is something they could have done in 1968 when they passed the -- the organic statute to begin with. I don't think it would have made a dime's worth of difference to the meaning.   But, if you believe that as a matter of grammar the \"knowingly\" and \"intentionally\" can only move forward and not backwards, if it can only radiate later and not earlier, if you believe that, then you'd have to say that there's a material difference between placing it later and placing it first. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, there is a material difference between placing it later and placing it first, but the problem is not just the sequence.   The problem is what an adverb can modify.   It can only modify a verb, and \"except as authorized\" is not a verb. Anyway, beyond that, what about 885? \"It shall not be necessary for the United States to negative any exemption or exception set forth in this subchapter,\" et cetera, et cetera, \"and not only in a pleading but also in any trial.\" "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " That -- that's in a pleading -- well, that -- that's right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It says in a trial. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes, but that -- that -- that -- that provision has been read to mean that there is a -- that the burden of coming forward, as we used to say in evidence class, the burden of coming forward falls to the defense, to put the defense at issue. But then -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, it has been read that way.   Is that the proper reading? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " I think it is the proper reading. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why is it the proper reading? The government doesn't have to negative this in a trial. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, let -- let -- let me -- you know, I -- at the risk of -- of recurring to statutory history, I should point out that under the Harrison Act, the -- the cognate of that provision said that the burden of proof was on the defense. When CSA was enacted many years later, that formulation in 885, I think, makes quite clear that it's just a burden of coming forward. And that's all there is. We don't dispute it.   We came forward with this defense.   And then the instruction took it off the table.   It said to the jury: If you find that this doctor deviated from the usual course of medical practice, you can convict him, full stop. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   You say that -- I don't want to belabor the point.   You say that what this means is that the defense has to produce a prima facie case, right? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, I -- the way I would put it is -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Has to satisfy a burden of production? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And then somebody has to prove something.   And when this provision says that the government doesn't have to negative it, that means that, actually, the government has to prove it and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " It does not have to allege it in its indictment, but it does have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, a proposition with which every single recorded case is in agreement. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, that may well be -- that may well be true, but they're not our cases, and they might be wrong.   And I know that what I'm suggesting about what the language means is not supported by either you or by Mr. Feigin, but we are interpreting statutes and regulations, and maybe we ought to start with what they actually say. Purpose does come into this inquiry, but it's in the regulation, \"for the purpose of\" doing certain things. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If you're going to find purpose someplace, that's where you have to find it.   And as for good faith, I don't know where that word comes from at all.   It's nowhere. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, it -- it -- it -- it's certainly not in the statute in those words.   That's true.   It is, however, a useful shorthand way of capturing what it means to do something knowingly and intentionally, which are familiar terms of art that have been read to entail a good-faith defense. But, Justice Alito, I think it's worth trying on for size what the world would look like under the interpretation that you're at least raising as a -- as a possibility.   In that world, a doctor -- his only defense would be that he didn't know he was prescribing a controlled substance.   And I suggest that that would mean that the only doctors who could possibly be acquitted have prescribed the medicine in a coma. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No, that wouldn't -- it wouldn't follow because it -- it would have to -- the prescription would have to be an invalid prescription under the regulation, and it would be invalid if it was not written for a legitimate medical purpose.   He has to have that purpose. Anyway, I've taken up a lot of your time.   I just wanted to go through the language of these provisions because, to me at least, it's important as a starting point. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " With which, of course, I completely concur, Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel, I want to see if I understand it, so tell me if I make any mistakes here.   But we have a dispute over how far \"knowingly\" and \"intentionally\" distribute. Put that aside. Assume Justice Alito's grammar teacher was right, okay? I know you don't want to, but let's just -- let's just assume that. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " As I understand it, your position would still be that the \"except\" clause has to have some mens rea element to it because it's what distinguishes lawful from unlawful conduct; that is, a doctor would be otherwise prohibited in all instances without any mens rea from -- from -- from prescribing medicines. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And -- and so, under Staples, X-Citement Video, as far back as Morissette, we would apply a mens rea.   You with me so far? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Absolutely. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   And then the next step is what do we do about -- and you use good faith as a shorthand for that argument. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Precisely. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   And then 885, in -- in your view as I understand it, provides that the government doesn't have to negative all the possible exceptions that would allow someone to hold prescription drugs. So, for example, there are veterinarians, there are pharmacists, there are family members who can hold drugs for loved ones under the except -- under the exceptions provided for in the statute, and the government doesn't have to plead and prove that all of those exceptions don't apply in the case at hand. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " I agree with that. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   But what it does provide is that you have to come forward, a burden of production, it says the burden of going forward with evidence, which is often used as another shorthand for the burden of production -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- to invoke one of those exceptions and that when you do, then the government has the burden of proving all the elements of the crime -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- and that one of those elements is mens rea. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " I agree with all of that.

As I understand it, there's a spot in your brief where you say that the Seventh, First, and maybe Fourth Circuits, if I remember the circuits correctly, have adopted a subjective test that you say is substantially similar, but they don't say good faith; they use the \"intentionally\" formulation. So what is the difference? And if we agree with you, why would we say good faith rather than just sticking closer to the language? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, good -- good faith is regularly used in the circuits.   I certainly agree with Justice Alito that it isn't in so many words in the statute. It is captured in the First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuit standard that the -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But they don't say good faith, am I right? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, they actually -- they do use the words \"good faith\" if you read some of the cases, but they also say that what the jury must be told is that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the doctor knowingly and intentionally lacked a good-faith medical purpose and knowingly -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " I thought legitimate medical purpose? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So you're -- but -- but -- but you're putting good faith into the formulation?

I don't want you purposely or knowingly to talk about Basingstoke's book about the Gallic wars unless we're talking about the Gallic wars.

Brindley", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Gonzales versus Oregon, this Court found that as applied to doctors, the purpose of the CSA was only to prohibit the use of prescriptions to engage in drug trafficking as conventionally understood. If it is sufficient to find only that a doctor acted outside the usual course of practice without reference to the purpose of the prescription, then doctors can be convicted for failing to follow medical norms even if they prescribe for -- never prescribed for an illegitimate reason. This allows conviction of doctors who misapprehend the extent of their obligations but are not drug dealing as conventionally understood. There are myriad mechanisms for protecting patients from doctors who violate the standard of care in various ways.   That is not the function of Section 841. The question under 841 is not whether a doctor was a bad doctor but whether he was a drug dealer.   Thus, under 841, any good faith definition must be based solely on the sincerity of the doctor's purpose in writing the prescription. And, with that, I welcome the questions of the Court.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, you refer to the good faith definition, and I understand your friend on the other side to be arguing that reduces to an idiosyncratic view of what the law ought to be.

"}, {"speaker": "Beau B. Brindley", "text": " No, absolutely not, Chief Justice Roberts, I am not. What we are asking for is that the question of whether -- what the usual course of professional practice is, that is an objective question that will be answered by the presentation of evidence and facts regarding what the standards are. And then the question of what the doctor's intent was is the next question.   Did the doctor intend to write the prescription without a legitimate medical purpose? But whether or not the prescription served a legitimate medical purpose is an objective question. So we are not suggesting that somehow he can create for himself the definition of medical practice.   Objective evidence will decide the definition of medical practice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Is -- is there objective evidence out there, like in -- in terms of pain management prescriptions, they should be this, you know, whatever, this much a month or you should be sure not to go over this or whatever?

Feigin", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although Petitioners are trying to disclaim it as much as they can, they really are asking this Court to transform their DEA registrations, which are premised on the idea that they're actually practicing medicine, into licenses to, at their own subjective views, violate the general rule that drug pushing is illegal. They want to be free of any obligation even to undertake any minimal effort to act like doctors when they prescribe dangerous, highly addictive, and, in one case, lethal dosages of drugs to trusting and vulnerable patients. That's not what this Court said in Moore, where I think everyone agrees the Court implicitly adopted the jury instructions in that case, which distilled the statutory and regulatory requirements here to come up with an honest effort standard. If a doctor is trying, in Moore's words, \"to act as a physician,\" he can't be convicted under Section 841.   But a doctor can't choose to be the kind of doctor who seeks a DEA registration because he wants to deal with the most dangerous drugs that we have with a recognized medical use and then decide that, notwithstanding the boundaries of that license, he can invoke it to shield all drug dealing that he's running in the guise of a doctor's office. There's been some suggestion today that applying a knowledge standard, you know, what's the difference? It's all oblique, these are very oblique examples, and it's never going to matter in practice.   And I'd like to -- if I get a chance later, to explain exactly why that is -- why this isn't just a matter of -- of hypotheticals. I think there -- I can give you three examples, we have more, but three examples of cases, and these are admittedly stylized a bit, but they're based in reality of -- of why this really matters on the ground. Number one would just be the irrationally egotistical doctor, and these are the kinds of cases we have trouble even bringing, let alone convicting a doctor.   It's a doctor who gets his license and his registration and he says, all right, you know, I've -- I -- I think, at bottom, the Hippocratic oath, I just want to treat patients.   And he prescribes substances that are -- any other doctor would say are crazy and lethal.   And he says, at bottom, we're all doctors, and my subjective belief is, at the end of the day, if any -- if doctors see patients, they got to do right by those patients.   And that's number one. Number two would be the absentee doctor, and one problem with their standard is it really rewards doctors for untethering themselves not only from the medical profession but from their patients.   It's the kind of doctor, and I think you'll see some resemblances to the doctors here, who doesn't follow up on the background of his patients, doesn't make sure they're taking the medications, doesn't even conduct physical exams, doesn't check the database to see who else is prescribing opioids, and trusts nurse practitioners, who aren't DEA registrants, aren't allowed to do this, don't have medical licenses, to do most of the prescribing.

But, as a question of the mens rea presumption, if the Court were inclined to think that the mens rea presumption applies, I think all the background -- first of all, 885(a), and second of all, all the background of the Harrison Act cases, which I think Mr. Robbins acknowledged, we didn't have to prove knowledge, as well as this Court's decision in Moore, which says, if anything, the CSA was meant to strengthen the Harrison Act cases, all -- plus the Court's discussion in Moore about freedom for experimentation, which the government addressed in its reply brief at page 13 by pointing to the honest effort standard. I think this all shakes out in a different place than it might with some other statutes.   I think this is the rare type of statute where, given the grave harm that can be done to these patients, given the public, I think, as Moore recognizes, Congress drew the line at a place where it's not too much to ask a trained professional who voluntarily -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

One is the mens rea presumption.   As I was just saying, I do think this is the type of case particularly because it is pitched as an affirmative defense and we're dealing with trained professionals who voluntarily choose to work with dangerous substances with vulnerable patients, that the idea of some objective manifestation of at least an attempt to practice some recognizable form of medicine is where the standard should land if you're -- want to go with the mens rea presumption. But where I actually think Moore got it -- and I think this actually may go, Justice Thomas, to some of the questions you were asking Mr. Robbins at the beginning of his argument -- is the legitimate medical purpose standard that is in both the statute and the regulations, which I think otherwise did not have much play in the Court's opinion in Moore and the Court essentially translated in that context into an honest effort standard. And as I was just saying, legitimate medical purpose is an objective standard.   There are legitimate and illegitimate medical purposes, and the doctor has to at least be doing something that other doctors would recognize as an attempt to be practicing as a doctor before he can wave around his DEA registration as a shield -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Feigin?

So all of this really comes from -- I mean, I have many of the same questions as Justice Thomas because none of this, obviously, is in the statutory language, and the authorization clause is pretty circular. So it is -- it all comes down to the regulation in Moore, am I correct? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, I wouldn't say it all comes down to the regulation in Moore just because -- perhaps this is more circularity, and I apologize, Your Honor, but Moore itself says that the regulation and its text are grounded in the statute ultimately.

I'm not entirely certain that the government would be free to adopt a substantially different regulation than the one it has adopted given the -- both the statutory language that's already in the CSA plus this Court's interpretation in Gonzales against Oregon, like it's now pellucidly clear the government can't -- I mean, it -- it can, but the -- the primary thrust of the -- it can regulate medicine, but the primary thrust of the CSA is for state regulation of medicine, and that's why the standard is worded the way that it is here. And I think that standard, which was the same standard in Moore, you had the same statutes in Moore, shakes out the way that Moore did where -- where what we're looking at is, is this person actually acting as a doctor?

And it's, I think, going to be informed by the expert's testimony as to the other piece of this, which is the usual course of medical practice.   If you read the entire regulation, it's -- I mean, just the first sentence of it, it's prescribing for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the course of his professional practice. And all the professional practice information that's going to come in is really going to inform that determination because it's the case here, as in the case of pretty much all the people we prosecute under these provisions, that what they're doing is, as these patients did -- excuse me, these doctors did, they aren't actually examining the patients or -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Feigin, again -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric J.

But I -- I -- courts have understood the term \"honest effort\" as an objective standard, as I think they should. If a partner asks an associate to try to find case law to support a proposition and give me an honest effort to do that, and -- I don't think the partner expects the associate to respond: I'm not going to run any search at all -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Feigin, let me suggest a way of finding a mens rea in this combination of statutory provisions and a regulation, and it can be found in the regulation.   It can be read into the regulation, which does say it must be done for a purpose. So you can read in some sort of mens rea there.   I think you might read in the mens rea of recklessness so that a doctor who knows what a legitimate medical purpose is but -- or doesn't -- is -- is reckless as to the -- as to ascertaining what a medical purpose is would fall within the prohibition. I -- I -- I understand that there are serious practical problems and questions of fairness that arise if this is read as having no mens rea whatsoever.   But what disturbs me about some of the arguments -- well, many things disturb me about some of the arguments. One is the ungrammatical reading of the statute itself.   The second is the idea that the \"except\" clause is an element.   If it's an element, it has to be pled in the indictment as -- as far as I'm aware.   And, therefore, the indictments in -- I haven't looked at the indictments in this case -- but they would be invalid if they don't allege that.   So these -- these Petitioners would not only be entitled potentially to a new trial, they'd be entitled to have the indictments dismissed, and all the other indictments would be -- that have been provided here have been -- have been flawed. And then you have the problem of 885. The \"except\" clause is an exception.   It's like a justification under the common law.   It doesn't have to be pled in the indictment, and it's not one of the things that necessarily has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.   It's more in the nature of an affirmative defense, and as to an affirmative defense, the -- the burden of production and the burden of persuasion can be allocated differently. What I really don't understand about your argument is what you say about 885.   I -- I -- I -- I'm baffled by your reading that says that this allocates the burden of production to the defense but not -- but not the -- the burden of -- of persuasion when it says that as to any exemption, including this exemption, the government is not required to negative it at trial.

You -- you can retain it under certain conditions, that is, that you comply with the standards of the medical profession of prescribing drugs, et cetera. Can you tell -- and then it comes up as to whether this compliance is sufficient when you are indicted for the underlying 841 crime.

You don't have to -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric J.

And I think the right way to think about this is that our laws have a general prohibition against the distribution of these dangerous substances.   Physicians have a special exemption that they're granted, but their special exemption ends when they start violating the terms of the license the government has given them to do something. One -- one analogy might be, Your Honor, I don't know whether it's a perfect analogy again, but, you know, there may be certain things we allow police officers to do, like exceed the speed limit, Mr. Chief Justice, that we don't allow them to do in, for example, the course of their daily life. And I think, by the same token here, there may be some government authorization to do something that, frankly, I don't think anyone in this room, unless there's some doctor here, could do, we allow doctors to do it because they're trained professionals, but, when they exceed the scope of their registration and their special ability to do it, they become the same as ordinary people violating the criminal laws. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " And my only point is -- and I won't belabor it -- is that if a doctor in -- in -- in the State of Virginia, for example, does not comply with his or her license, then you lose your license to practice medicine.   So it's regulatory. Here, there isn't that intermediate step, that is, that you lose your registration that allows you to prescribe certain drugs. Instead, it's folded into the underlying criminal violation.   That's all I'm saying. It's -- and I just -- my concern was that we seem to be doing things -- two things at the same time with some quite significant criminal penalties. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Ah.   Sorry.   I'm sorry, Justice Thomas.   I was misunderstanding the question.   That's the way it works under federal law too, is that also there's a set of civil revocation proceedings that can and would occur. And, for example, Dr. Kahn's license was revoked -- his -- sorry, I'm sorry, his DEA registration as well as, I think, his state license. That is a separate proceeding, but we're -- I -- I don't think it makes any sense and the statutes don't require that the revocation of the license, the registration as a civil action precede the prosecution because, if it did, then you'd get basically one free shot. You could start dealing drugs on a street corner, you'd get your license revoked, and then, if you -- only if you did it again would you be violating the criminal laws.   I don't think that's how it works. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer, anything further? Justice Alito?

But let me give this one -- let me give this one -- one try, Your Honor, which is you might have a doctor who has a patient -- I -- I think -- I think the reason for allowing a conviction to rest on either of them is because it clarifies a situation like the following. A doctor has a patient in front of him who's legitimately in pain, legitimately does need some opioids, but there are strong indications, for example, through bodily fluid tests and so forth, that although she's been receiving the pain medications, she's not actually taking them and she's probably just giving them to somebody else and is going to sell them. You might think that that is for a legitimate -- you're still prescribing the drugs for a legitimate medical purpose because the doctor's really hoping this time the patient takes the meds herself because she needs them. But it's outside the usual course of medical practice because all the indicators of diversion show that the doctor really should not be prescribing these drugs to that patient. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, I'm not sure how that's not the same thing, meaning why would prescribing it ever be considered medically legitimate if in the objective, ordinary standard of business it's not considered appropriate? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J.

As we say in our brief -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, it has to be both, though. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " -- I doubt there are very many cases in which a jury -- I -- I -- I -- I dare to say there are probably none in which a jury thinks that there was a prescription that a doctor issued within the usual course of his practice that was not also issued for a legitimate medical purpose. I was positing one scenario where perhaps a jury might have -- might think that, but I think, in reality, the real reason for splitting them out in the way that we think the jury instructions here properly did is because of the converse situation where a doctor just, you know, meets someone on the street who says, I have pain, writes out a script, and hands it to him without even examining him or doing any of the other things you'd think a doctor would, other than signing an illegible signature on the bottom of a prescription.

Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think the legitimate medical purpose also does play a role in generating, as I was suggesting to Justice Barrett, the good-faith standard because I think it informs the entire regulation. I mean, the regulation reads as one unitary piece, but what these jury instructions do is they clarify for the jury not just to focus on the idea that the doctor, as all the doctor defendants do in these cases, just says: Look, I had a patient who's in front of me who's in pain.   I prescribed. Not that that's not enough, that the doctor has to be really doing things the way a doctor would and have it ultimately shake out to be the kind of prescription that we'd expect a doctor to write.   The defendant has to at least be attempting to do that. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan? Justice Kavanaugh?

So just so that I understand, I asked before, is all of this coming from the regulation and from Moore because it's not in the text of the statute.   We've talked about the honest attempt standard. It does seem to me and you've said that to the extent that there is some sort of mens rea requirement wrapped up in this phrase, honest attempt, I think you -- I understood you to say to Justice Gorsuch that that is a sort of mens rea requirement? Did I understand that correctly? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " I think that is a -- I mean, it's -- Your Honor, I -- I -- I -- I think it's roughly akin to a -- a -- a form of extreme objectively grounded mens rea. And I say \"extreme\" as I mean incredibly defendant-friendly, not similar to civil law, as we've pointed out in our brief. Defendant-friendly kind of criminal standard that you could see if you looked at Model Penal Code 202 and the commentary thereof where, you know, really, if you just have a defendant who's acting in a grossly unreasonable fashion, that that's sufficient and it's a context-dependent inquiry as to whether that's the right mens rea that depends on the circumstances. And I think portions of Moore and this Court's Harrison Act cases and I think common sense reflect that this is such a situation given the vulnerability of the patients and the general public and the fact that these doctors seek out these DEA registrations, and they're licensed professionals. And we shouldn't have situations like we had after raiding Ruan's clinic where the price of opioids on the streets doubles because suddenly the supply has been cut off. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Okay.   Can I just then, just to wrap up, so that honest attempt requirement, which is some form of mens rea, exists by the government's grace because of the regulation because nothing in the statutory text requires it? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, a -- a couple of points to that, Your Honor. As I've earlier suggested and I think as Moore bears out, the regulatory language is grounded in the statutory language itself.   So I'm uncertain whether the government would really be able to adopt a substantially different regulation to govern this particular context. And the other thing I would say is, if this Court were to apply the mens rea presumption, it could also come from there, but, ultimately, we are landing in the same place that Moore did.   We're taking this -- we have been taking this Court's teachings from Moore, as we have for the past, you know, 47 years, and applying it to these cases. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Robbins? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First off, with all respect to my friend, Mr. Feigin, the government is not giving you an accurate rendering of Moore.   Footnote 20, the instruction to which counsel was just adverting, is -- states an honest efforts instruction, which we say in our Section 1(b) of our opening brief is satisfactory to us. But it is not an objective standard. The government is trying to objectify, if you will, a standard that was plainly intended to be subjective.   Why do I say that? Because, in the very next paragraph of the opinion, the Court says that, well, the defendant said he was just trying a novel technique to solve a problem, but the jury didn't believe him.   The jury didn't believe him. That says that this is a subjective question.   Did he make an honest effort? He said he did because he was using some novel technique, but the jury rejected it.   The jury didn't say: Well, the reason -- a reasonable doctor wouldn't do that.   An objectively reasonable doctor wouldn't do that.   No.   They said, we don't believe you, which is exactly what juries are entitled to do when they assess the purpose or intent of a defendant. They do that in every case, which is why we suggest that the medical purpose test simplifies the jury's task and adheres to the text of the statute.   But, if this Court is to use an honest efforts test instead, a la Footnote 20 of Moore, we should be clear that it is not an objective standard at all. The government's submission is, no matter how they disclaim it, a negligence standard gussied up as something else.   But my suggestion to the Court is that, you know, a billion objectives here and a billion reasonablenesses here, before you know it, you're talking about real negligence, and that's, I think, where we find ourselves with the government's argument. The proposition that this is ungrammatical, I resist it.   But even if it were ungrammatical, and I resist it because, in point of fact, Congress has placed this \"except as authorized\" downstream instead of upstream, and I don't think there's a dime's worth of difference between those two formulations between 841(a)(1) and 841(h), which was enacted 20-plus years later to deal with Internet sales. The Harrison Act cases manifestly support us and not the government.   You look need -- need look no further than the unanimous opinion in Linder to see that what matters was intent, subjective intent, of the doctor. And I want to close with one -- just one point that goes back to the Chief Justice's question at the beginning of this argument.   The Chief Justice asked: Is there a book that tells us what the right amount of medication is for a certain kind of disability? The answer is there is no such book, and that's the whole problem. The problem is that medical standards evolve.   It's a constantly evolving matter.   And the deference to patients and their illness and their doctors requires a subjective standard. I thank the Court. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
