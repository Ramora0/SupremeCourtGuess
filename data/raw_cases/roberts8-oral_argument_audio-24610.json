[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 17-459, Pereira versus Sessions. Mr. Zimmer. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The stop-time rule at issue in this case specifies exactly what the government must do in order to end an immigrant's period of continuous presence.   The government must serve a notice to appear under Section 1229(a), and as the name notice to appear suggests, the government cannot serve a notice to appear without telling an immigrant when and where to appear. Specifically, Section 1229(a) defines a notice to appear as notice that provides specific information, including the time and place at which proceedings will be held. Notice that lacks that required information and does not tell an immigrant when and where to appear is not a notice to appear under Section 1229(a) and does not trigger the stop-time rule. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Zimmer, you just said defines the notice of appear.   Why do you think that those 10 requirements of what have to be in a notice to appear define a notice to appear? You could imagine a case where somebody says, well, look, Requirement 7 isn't in the notice.   That was a mistake.   So it's a flawed notice to appear, but it's still a notice to appear.   It doesn't become not a notice to appear because there's a flaw in it. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, right.   So the answer to that, Justice Kagan, is -- is the way that the statute is written.   And because Section 1229(a) doesn't just -- doesn't just state what a notice to appear shall contain, it does define what a notice to appear is because of the language Congress used. And it's specifically the phrase in this section referred to as a notice to appear. And that is definitional language.   It is definitional -- sorry, definitional language that Congress uses routinely throughout the U.S. Code to give substantive meaning to specific terms.   And we give a number of examples of this on page 4 of the reply brief, including one particularly clear example where Congress actually referred to this language as definitional. And so, unlike a provision that just states what -- if -- if -- unlike a provision that just stated what a notice to appear shall contain, this provision states that the document in this section referred to as a notice to appear is written notice that specifies the required information. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And if any one on the list, any one is left out, then it's not a notice to appear? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, yes, that's right, Justice Ginsburg.   But I think it's important to recognize that most of the information on that list will not vary from case to case. It's -- it's standard information that's simply on the notice to appear form. And so what we're really talking about in this case are really only two types of information.   It's the charges, the factual and legal charges against the immigrant, and the time and place of the hearing. And so those are really the two pieces of information that are really required that -- that there's any chance would ever be omitted, and it's entirely reasonable that Congress insisted that those two pieces of information be included in a notice in order to stop the time, because those are the two pieces of information that show that the government is serious, is -- is -- is committed to going forward with an actual removal proceeding. And, indeed, the -- the fact that those two pieces of information are required is supported by the only reason that's identified in the legislative history for which Congress actually enacted this rule.   Prior to 1996, there was no stop-time rule and immigrants continued to accrue permanent residence -- or, permanent presence all the way up until the point that they were actually removed from the country.

Zimmer", "text": " Yes, I -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why is that so? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " So it's -- it's so because of the definitional language in Section 1229(a). "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But I -- I don't see definitional language in there.   Where -- where's the definitional language? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " It's -- Justice Alito, it's the \"in this section referred to as\" language.   And that is language that, again, is used throughout the U.S. Code in order to define terms.   When -- when Congress states that the document \"in this section referred to as\" a notice to appear is written notice that specifies that information, that means that if the government serves written notice that does not specify that information, it has not served a notice to appear. And, again, this is not a unique provision.   That language appears throughout the U.S. Code and is used to -- to do exactly what it does in Section 1229(a), to define terms to have a specific substantive meaning. And, again -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What do you do with the government's position that using the word \"under\" in the notice to appear definitional section is different than what was done in other provisions -- parts of this that said \"in accordance with\" or \"required under\"? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So there is a difference of usage.   So why should we give it this -- \"under\" the same meaning? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Sure.   So two responses -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Doesn't that in -- in and of itself create an ambiguity? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " So -- so two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor.   The first is that the government's argument -- even the government admits that Congress was not consistent in how it identified all the information required by Section 12 -- by the notice to appear definition because, as your question suggested, Congress at one time uses \"notice in accordance with\" and one time \"required under.\" So there's no -- there's no real dispute that -- that Congress was not consistent in this way. But the other important difference is that in those provisions -- those provisions also referred to the notice required under Section 1229(a)(2), and there's no defined term in 1229(a)(2). And that's really the key difference, because the stop-time rule is only referring to the notice to appear.   And notice to appear is a defined term.   It's a term that's defined to mean the notice of the specific information listed in Section 1229(a)(1), and because it's a defined term, there is no additional language needed to convey -- to convey the -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If I -- if we were to disagree with you that there -- and -- and say there's ambiguity, where does that leave your argument? Do you lose? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, no, Your Honor.   I mean -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Because of Chevron and deference to the government? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Right.   Well, no.   I mean, as we explained in the brief, we also believe that the -- you know, we also argue and -- and believe that BIA's interpretation is unreasonable under Chevron's second step. But -- but certainly as to the first step, the fact that Section 1229(a) does use the defined phrase -- the defined term notice to appear and that the stop-time rule specifically is triggered only on service of a notice to appear under Section 1229(a), invoking that document, that that does unambiguously require that the government actually serve the document that is identified in Section 1229(a). "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " How -- how does the -- the logistical problem -- at least if I understand it correctly.   So there's this notice to appear, but at the time, the department doesn't know when the immigration court is going to be able to slot this case in. So it doesn't have the -- it wants to stop the clock on accumulating years in the United States, so it sends this notice and then -- and time to be determined.   How -- how -- how is the department supposed to determine the time? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, so, as the government admits, and this is on page 50, Note 15 of its brief, the government actually had a system, it was using a system that did allow it to identify the time and include it on the notice to appear. And, in fact, this is explained in even more detail in the amicus brief submitted by former BIA chairman and Immigration Judge Schmidt, who -- who explains that this system allowed coordination between the Department of Homeland Security and the immigration courts, such that individual DHS officers could identify a time that could be included on the notice to appear. And Judge Schmidt explains, again, in great detail, why that system not only worked but made the immigration courts function more effectively.   And the government, again, admits on page 50 of its brief that it had this system and simply states that it stopped using it. There's no explanation as to why. So this is not an insurmountable problem.   And it's not something -- and, in fact, it's not even a problem at all because the government had a system that actually did this. And it's no surprise that the government had a system that did this given that police officers from -- in municipal governments all across the country are able to include hearing dates on -- on traffic tickets. When they pull someone over, they can use, you know, any kind -- the system -- any kind of electronic system to identify the next available hearing date and include it on the ticket. So this is not a problem.   It's not a problem at all.   This is just the way that DHS has chosen to implement its system.   And that choice that -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You say we don't know why they abandoned that system? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, no, the government has never explained.   They do not explain in their brief.   It's, as far as we know, they've never explained.   And, again, Judge Schmidt's amicus brief -- and, again, this is from the perspective of an immigration judge who is actually using and benefiting from the system -- he had no idea.   And he -- as he explains in his brief, the system actually worked.   It made the immigration courts work more effectively because there are serious logistical problems that are caused by not including this information in the notice to appear. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, would it be better to include a date, even if in the great majority of cases the date is going to be changed, which can be done? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " So, yes, the date certainly can be changed, and yes -- and yes, it is better to include a date in the initial notice anyway.   And let me give three reasons why that's true. The first is that requiring the government to include a date ensures that when the time is stopped, when the immigrant is prevented from accruing additional time, the government is actually serious about proceeding with -- with a -- with a removal proceeding, of going forward with the proceeding. And if you look at a case like Camarillo, you can see why that's important, where the government served one of these notices that did not include the time and place, and then just sat on it for over two years without doing anything at all. And it's totally reasonable that in that context Congress thought that that time should continue to accrue on behalf of the immigrant. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I don't see how your rule would change that.   So they include a date and then, after a period of time, when they are not ready to -- to proceed on that date, the date is changed.   And they just keep changing the date. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What is achieved? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " So I think the system does assume a certain degree of good faith on the government's part to not put a date that it knows -- knows to be false.   So that -- I think Congress certainly did not anticipate that the government would simply lie. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I thought your -- "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " But -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- I thought the example you just gave us was an example of bad faith. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Oh, I don't -- no.   I think that what happened in Camarillo was not bad faith.   They just served the notice at the time they were not ready to go forward at -- with the proceeding. And, you know, there's nothing inherently wrong with doing that, with serving notice of charges and saying we're going to go forward with a proceeding at some undefinite time in the -- indefinite time in the future. But the point is that the statute Congress wrote makes clear that the -- that the result of that decision is that the time does not stop until the government is actually ready to go forward with a hearing. And that makes sense, especially looking at the legislative history of why Congress actually enacted this rule.   And the reason that was, was that Congress wanted to make sure that immigrants were not able to -- to avoid or delay proceedings in order to manufacture additional time. So, prior to 1996, there was -- Congress thought that there was a problem because, because time continued to accrue until the person was actually removed from the country, that created an -- an incentives -- incentive for immigrants to file motions and to avoid proceedings, to draw out proceedings and gain additional time. So what the stop-time rule does is it says at the time there's an actual hearing, when the government is prepared to go forward with the hearing and schedules a hearing that could be avoided or delayed, then time stops. But until that time, until an actual hearing has been scheduled that could be avoided or delayed, then the delay is rightfully with the government.   And governmental delays have always historically counted towards an immigrant's accrual of additional residence. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, what if they send a notice that specifies a date and then let's say two weeks later they send another notice that says that the -- the proceeding on that date is canceled and a new date will be set at some time in the future? What would happen then? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " I mean, I think in that context -- I mean, that's an interesting question, Your Honor.   I think in that context the -- the initial notice -- I mean, certainly, as of the time that the initial notice was sent, it would trigger the stop-time rule because there was a date on the notice and that satisfies the statute. I mean, if the government then sort of rescinded the date and didn't provide another date -- I mean, I'm not actually sure that the statute allows the government to do that because the Section 1229(a)(2) allows for a change in the hearing.   But I'm not sure it allows for a change in the hearing to no date at all. And so I'm not sure the government would actually have -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I think the provision requires in writing a change of date, doesn't it? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " It does.   And -- and I don't think anything in that provision would allow the government to change the date to no date.   I think that once the government provides a date, the statute only authorizes it to change that to a -- to a different date. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but it's -- it's -- it's an important practical question because there are a lot of hearings and there are limited numbers of people available to conduct the hearing.   I mean, what if it just says, okay, our normal process, we try to get you in, you know, the third day of the second month or something, we always try, and then it turns out they're not going to be able to, so they say, okay, we'll try again. I mean, it's like when you get a traffic ticket and want to challenge it.   They say here is the time you go up, and the officer is never there, and they say, well, then come -- come back later, and the officer is not there, and eventually it shows up, but, I mean -- "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- it -- it -- it -- I don't see what's different from that. And it seems to take great -- or practical considerations do have some role to play. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, yes.   And that's why in the situation you're describing, Mr. Chief Justice, the first notice would -- the notice with the first date would trigger the stop-time rule, because the government has shown that it's ready to go forward with proceedings.   And there's no question -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I thought you were suggesting that they couldn't keep -- they couldn't put it off until the next time, or -- "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " No, they can change -- they can definitely change the date to another date.   What they can't do is say that date -- we're -- we're rescinding that date and we're not giving you an additional date. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can I go back and -- and ask how this works? And I was a little confused by what happened here.   They don't give you a date.   Then they give you -- they mail something to you, giving you a date, or -- or -- "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " In general. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What happened here? They didn't give him a date. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They then sent a change of date to -- to the -- to the wrong address, essentially. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And so he didn't get notice of the change of -- of address, and he was then deported, correct? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, he was -- a -- a final order of removal was entered.   He was not deported, but yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yeah, a final -- "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- order of removal.   I guess my question is, if you don't show up because you're not told when to show up, do you still have an obligation to tell them where to mail the notice to? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Yes, but -- yes, you -- you absolutely do, but what happened here is -- is Mr. Pereira did tell them where to mail the notice to and they didn't send it to that address.   And I don't think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So why are we here at all, because -- since they didn't -- I -- I -- I -- I'm just asking as a practical question. Wouldn't the -- the final order have to be vacated because he was never given proper notice of the change of address? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " So that notice was vacated, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I see. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " And then later another -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Okay.   It's just the stop time that's -- "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Exactly.   So the issue is when -- when the government actually began removal proceedings in 2013, well after Mr. Pereira had accrued the -- the 10 years of continuous -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Got it. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " -- presence, then he tried to apply for -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I had forgotten that. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Okay.   Yeah.   So -- but to get back to the -- to the -- to the question, to the logistical questions, the point -- to get back to Mr. Chief Justice's question, when the government is actively trying to go forward with proceedings, and as, you know, then the fact that there may be some delay in actually scheduling those proceedings doesn't count against -- doesn't count against the government and doesn't change the stop-time trigger, because the government is actually going forward with proceedings. But the issue is when the government sends a notice that doesn't have a hearing at all and says we will provide a hearing in the future, that allows the government to -- it -- it basically stops the process.   The government isn't going -- actually going forward with removal proceedings.   In Camarillo -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, I under -- I understand.   It's just a question of the practical significance.   It seems the government can do one thing, which is saying, okay, we know we have to -- we're -- you know, we're interested in taking this action against you.   We don't quite know when we're going to have the, you know, available hearing officers and all that, and we'll let you know. Or you simply say, all right, okay, we're going to do it this day, and it turns out, well, an officer is not available that day.   We'll try in two more months.   Not -- not a big -- you know, is there any practical difference? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, yes, there's a big practical difference because, in a case like Camarillo, they're not trying to do that.   And I think that's the point. When the government serves these -- when the government serves an initial notice, it doesn't actually necessarily represent the government's intention to go forward with a proceeding at that time.   And that's why I was pointing out that, in Camarillo, after the government served this, it's not that it couldn't find a hearing to be scheduled for two years.   The government didn't file the notice with the immigration court for two years.   It just sat somewhere with the government doing nothing about it. And there's no reason to think that -- in fact, there's every reason to think that Congress believed that in that situation that time would not count for the government, that that would continue -- that residence would continue to accrue because the government hadn't taken the trouble to even try to schedule a hearing. But, of course, as soon as Congress tries to schedule a hearing, and schedules a hearing and provides notice of it, time stops, even if the next available hearing isn't for a year or two. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, that sounds like some sort of -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " No, go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- some sort of bad faith exception.   But I still don't understand what would be achieved. So presume -- let's assume that there's a reason, and we will ask Mr. Liu this, why they -- why they've adopted this new policy, but -- why they've adopted this policy, but if, in fact, they have difficulty ascertaining the date, and we were to adopt your rule, then what -- they could say, well, all right, on average, these would be held a certain number of days after the notice goes out, so we'll put that date down, but, you know, two weeks before then or a week before then or whatever, if we see that we're not going to be able to do it on that date, then we're going to, you know, extend it for 30 days, and they keep doing this.

We're going to wind up in the same place perhaps, and it's just a paper exercise. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " That's the concern, I think. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Right.   So -- but I -- so I don't think that that's actually a concern. And, in fact, I think the concern goes the other way because, again, the government -- there's no reason to think that the government is going to lie on one of these -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

And then we'll just send out a new notice, and a new notice, and a new notice, and a new notice, until we get to the date. So what's the difference between that regime and the regime we currently have? And why -- why is one better for your client than the other? Sometimes when courts require additional procedures to aid a criminal defendant or an immigrant, they wind up perversely creating the opposite, unintended effect.   Why isn't your case one of those? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, it certainly wouldn't create an adverse effect.   And, in fact, I think because there's real prejudice to immigrants from these -- these notices that don't include the date and time because it creates this -- this level of uncertainty, that they don't know, is the government actually going to go forward, are they going to file in immigration court, are they ever going to seek a hearing? Will it be tomorrow? Will it be in two years? Whereas, if there's a date, if there are actual proceedings ongoing, then at least you encourage the government to -- you know, to -- to go forward with the -- with the -- with the proceeding; whereas, if they don't even have to provide a date, then you get cases like Camarillo and like this case. Even in this case, the government did not file the notice in immigration court for over a year after it was initially served. Even putting aside all of the problems they later -- later had serving the hearing notice, the government didn't try to get a hearing for over a year. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Well, what the -- what the client could do is if -- if he or she wanted the hearings to proceed, she could go into immigration court and attempt to -- to actually have a hearing held instead of having that uncertainty.   Or no -- I mean, no, once the government is actively moving forward with proceedings, then the stop-time rule has been triggered, but, of course, that's the whole point.

So, in answer, I'm assuming, to Justice Gorsuch's question is your client can make no choices until the immigration court is notified? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " That's correct.   Yeah. That's correct.   That -- and that's one of the reasons that that's a key moment, the -- when the -- when a hearing is actually scheduled, that that's a key trigger. And, again, this goes back to the -- to the history as to why this rule was created in the first place, which was in order to prevent immigrants from extending their proceedings in order to avoid -- sorry, to extend their qualifying residence by avoiding or delaying proceedings. And until a hearing is actually scheduled, until the government actually mails notice of a proceeding, that concern simply doesn't come into effect because there's nothing an immigrant can do to avoid or delay a proceeding that has not been scheduled. And I also think it's important to recognize that the government's approach, the government's interpretation, would allow the government actually to -- to end -- end time, to trigger the stop-time rule long before it really has any intent at all of going forward, because it could serve notices to appear on the merest suspicion that someone might be removable without even identifying charges and without even identifying a hearing date. And there's no reason to think that that's what Congress intended, that Congress -- that Congress would have intended the Department of Homeland Security, on the slightest suspicion that someone was removable, to stop their time by handing out a form that didn't even identify why the -- why the person was removable. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Zimmer, can I take you back to the language of the statute and just ask about your assertion that this is clearly definitional in nature? I mean, one question is, is that necessary to your argument? And then the other question is, you know, here's an alternative view of this language, which is this language is a -- it's -- it's -- it's a notice of shorthand, it's -- you know, we need to call this thing something, this -- this thing which tells you to appear in -- at removal proceedings, and this is what we're going to call it.

It's not that it has to be -- it can't be corrected later, but it has to give the information in that -- it has to give the information listed in Section 1229(a) in order to be a notice to appear that would trigger the stop-time rule as a notice to appear under Section 1229(a).

The question arose, there were no notices to appear because there were only orders to show cause.   So what could Congress have been talking about? It went through the trouble the following year to clarify that those notices to appear that they were talking about were the old orders to show cause.   And the old orders to show cause didn't have to require a date and time. So that's proof right there in the statutory history that Congress thought about what's necessary to -- to be a notice to appear and what's not, and it drew the line right where the government is drawing it.

It's telling you that the government wants you to appear. And then, if the government wants you to appear, the first thing you need to know is, where am I supposed to appear? When am I supposed to appear? So that there will be somebody who will do what they want to do with me when I appear. So it's -- I mean, it would -- it would seem actually even more than the charges itself that a notice to appear, you know, the sine qua non is telling you where you should appear.

It's not the essential -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, you talk about it as a charging document.

I mean, it does say that the clock starts -- stops ticking when the alien is served a notice to appear under Section 12. Then you look at the section, and it says a notice to appear shall specify nine things, including the time and place at which you're supposed to appear. And in the government's view -- I looked at the notice to appear here -- every one of those things is included on the document, except not notice to appear -- I mean, where you're supposed to appear.   And that seems odd, but assume you're right. We then get to step 2 of Chevron, and step 2 says that the agency decision has to be reasonable.   So I looked for the reason. What's the reason that they don't want to put in a notice to appear? And I notice the former chairman of the BIA said there used to be a process called -- it was called interactive scheduling. "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

And \"he does not know exactly why.\" Okay.   So I think to have a reasonable agency decision you would have to say not just that there are other things that don't appear, that you say have to appear, but you'd have to have a reason why this, which says does appear, doesn't appear.

My second point is that if you -- that that -- that's only half the story.   If you read the end of the story, Justice Sotomayor, you'll see Congress reaching back and making express in the text of the statute that those old orders to show cause that didn't include the hearing date do qualify as notices to appear and should be given stop-time effect.

There was actually even a question about whether the agency thought it was bound by a prior decision or was exercising its administrative judgment.   And the Court said: Well, it's clear enough that the agency was exercising its administrative judgment. That's entitled to deference. I would say the same thing here.

I -- I -- I admit the record, the administrative record, we have is not exceptionally clear on that point, but my understanding is that in 2007, when that initial removal order was issued, that the IJ assumed that Pereira had received notice. Now, when it turned out later that Pereira hadn't received that notice, the IJ -- actually turned out to be the same IJ, reopened those proceedings.   And -- and so that's the precise consequence that Congress attached to the failure to give the date and time.   You see it play out in the very facts of this case. This is the (b)(5) consequence.   When Congress said you need to get notice in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of Section 1229(a), this was the consequence it had in mind.   You can't get removed in absentia, and you have the authority to rescind it. Now my friend says the date is important because it reflects the seriousness with which we're -- we're proceeding with -- with -- with the process.   That argument was raised and rejected in a very similar context in Edelman.   There, the -- the question was whether the requirement that a charge with the EEOC be -- be under oath or affirmation was part of what a charge was. And the Court said the point of that verification requirement was to ensure that the -- the complainant was serious enough and sure enough to support the complaint.   That's why there was an oath -- an oath requirement. And the Court said that provision is not part of the definition of a charge. Neither provision incorporates the other so as to give a definition by necessary implication. And the Court said that to -- to recharge as incorporating the under oath requirement as part of its definition was \"a structural and logical leap.\" "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Could we go back, Mr. Liu, to the text of the statute, and could you tell me what your best response is to Mr. Zimmer's argument about this parenthetical \"(in this section -- "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " Right.

"}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " Right.   I -- I think that parenthetical is just identifying the type of document that is.   It's an easy shorthand to say the document that initiates the proceedings, and that's the title of 1229, Initiating Removal Proceedings, the document that does so is referred to as the notice to appear. I think it's just giving a -- an identifying -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So then what do we look to? When you were giving your sense of it has to include this, but it doesn't have to include that -- "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- if -- if -- if we don't look to that parenthetical for the reason that you said, what do we look to to decide what is definitionally part of a notice to appear? "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " Right.   Well, I think the Court applies the same functional approach that it's applied in Becker, in Scarborough with respect to fee applications, in Gonzalez v. Thaler with -- with respect to certificates of appealability, in Edelman with respect to charges filed with the EEOC.   And I think the -- the Court does have to have some understanding of what the function of that document is. The statute here makes plain what the function of this document is.   It is to initiate removal proceedings. I think it's also fair to look at the function of the stop-time rule, and the function of the stop-time rule is to basically say to the alien: Look, while it's true that being physically present in the United States builds some sort of reasonable reliance interests up to a point, it's no longer reasonable to rely on being in the United States once the government has given you a -- a notice to appear that tells you that the government intends to remove you. It was the point of the stop-time rule to make the stop-time determination turn on the beginning of the proceedings, not at things that would happen later. And if you're looking at legislative history, Justice Sotomayor, this is 143 Congressional Record S12266, where Congress, again, amending the statute to make clear that the old orders to show cause that lacked a date would qualify, said the reason we're doing this isn't because of some housekeeping measure but for the substantive reason, the affirmative reason, that we think the stop-time calculation should be made at the very beginning of the proceedings and shouldn't be affected by things like how crowded the immigration courts are, which could affect the timing of the hearing and, in turn, the -- the timing of the hearing notice. I -- I think my -- my friend in the reply brief puts a lot of weight on the word \"under\" and -- and says that the word \"under\" should be read to mean in accordance with. You know, this Court has said \"under\" is a chameleon and it must be understood in its context.   And if there's one meaning of \"under\" that the context here rules out, it is the \"in accordance\" definition because, as I have said, (b)(5), Congress used those exact words.   So we know that, when it wanted to express something different, it used a different word, as it did here. If there are no further questions, we ask that the judgment be affirmed. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Zimmer, three minutes. "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Thank you. I think the main point here that I want to make is just that the statute actually doesn't distinguish at all between these provisions in Section 1229(a), between the types of notice that are listed.   And the government now wants to get up and say: Oh, well, we think certain ones are important and certain ones are unimportant. And, you know, the most straightforward response to that is that Congress treated them all identically and so, if any are required, which the government admits that some are, they must all be required. And, indeed, the BIA even recognized this.   The BIA did not pick and choose.   The BIA -- the BIA recognized it was either/or: Either they were all required or none were required.   And the BIA held that there were no substantive requirements on a notice to appear to trigger the stop-time rule. Now, to the extent we want to pick and choose between these, it seems like the one thing that should be included in a notice to appear is when to appear.   And so it's hard to see if the real inquiry here should be not what the BIA did but which of these are the most important, how the government can just pick, for instance, the nature of the proceedings against the alien, which is on the form, it's just a line on the top of the form that just says in removal proceedings under 240 of the Act.   But the government doesn't need to actually tell the immigrant when and where to appear in a notice to appear. And, again, it's hard to see why that's what Congress would have intended, especially given that, in 1996, the same Congress that adopted the stop-time rule amended the statute to specifically include the time and place of proceedings in the notice to appear and, in fact, named that document a notice to appear.   A notice to appear. So the Congress that adopted this stop-time rule knew that this was a document that included this -- the time and place of proceedings and, in fact, specifically it required that that be provided upfront. And, again, the government also notes that the -- the Congress would have wanted the stop-time rule to be triggered on the -- at the beginning of proceedings.   But it's unclear why the proceedings begin at a time where the government has simply served a document on an immigrant without a time of hearing that has never even been filed in court. You would never say that a civil proceeding had begun when one party shared a draft complaint with the other party.   The proceeding is begun when it's filed in court. And -- and so, in this case, the government is arguing that the proceeding -- that the stop-time rule should be triggered long before the proceeding starts.   In fact, in Camarillo's case, two years before the proceeding was started.   In this case, over one year before the proceeding was started. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But when he -- when he had notice that the government was going to attempt to remove him? "}, {"speaker": "David J. Zimmer", "text": " Well, that the government might attempt to remove him.   The government does not always even file these notices in immigration court.   If you look at data, public data from DHS and the immigration courts, approximately 10 percent of notices to appear that are issued are never even filed in immigration court at all. So there's not even a guarantee that when one of these documents is served, is actually served on an immigrant, the government could choose -- it could exercise prosecutorial discretion and never file it in immigration court. That's certainly something that DHS could do and it's something that DHS does.   And that's why Congress triggered the rule on an actual proceeding, when government -- when the government was ready to go forward with an actual proceeding, when there were charges identified and when there was a time and place of the proceeding identified, not at the time the -- that the government expressed some abstract intention of possibly seeking removal in the future.
