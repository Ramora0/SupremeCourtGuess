[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 17-269, Washington versus the United States. Mr. Purcell. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State of Washington wants to protect salmon and has voluntarily spent billions of dollars to achieve that goal.   Our objection is the unworkable treaty right the Ninth Circuit announced.   Respondents have abandoned that court's reasoning here, but the alternative theories that they offer were not addressed by the courts below and cannot support the judgment.   So this Court should reverse or, at most, should clarify what legal rule the treaties impose and then remand to the district court to apply it. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I think you mean at least, right? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, sorry, we'd prefer that you reverse.   Sorry, how you want to clarify -- yeah, at most, at least.   Sorry. Sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.   You -- you're the better oral advocate on all of this, I'll stipulate that. The central question, though, is what legal standard the treaties apply -- impose. And, again, the Respondents have abandoned the rule that the Ninth Circuit advanced and -- and rightly so, and instead they're arguing a new theory.   But even under that theory, the treaties would regulate virtually every significant human activity off reservation, and federal courts in the Northwest would be regulating -- essentially would be imposing environmental laws, would be the primary environmental regulators, rather than leaving most decisions to state and federal policymakers, as should be the case. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " In the courts below during the argument in the Ninth Circuit, you said the Stevens Treaty would not prohibit Washington from blocking completely every salmon stream into Puget Sound.   Basically, the right to take fish, to you, means the right to take fish if you decide you want to provide fish.   Is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " I -- I remember that answer well, Your Honor, and that was a mistake at oral argument about how our theory -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what is your position now? When can you and how much can you block fish? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " So, Your Honor, we believe that to show a treaty violation, the tribes should have to show four things: That a state barrier is causing a large decline in a particular river and that it's not justified by substantial compelling interests. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I don't know -- I don't know that it's a large decline.   I think it has to be a material decline, no? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, it -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Every -- every -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " The precise word, Your Honor, we're less concerned about than that it be a meaningful decline, because, otherwise, as I was saying, the concern is that there are many, many things that affect salmon, Your Honor, from zoning decisions to climate change to transportation, and if you don't set the bar at least at some reasonable level, then -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, don't you think the court below did? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " No, Your Honor, the court below explicitly said that Respondents did not need to show anything about the -- to quantify the effect of state culverts on salmon and -- and just said that any diminishment is a treaty violation.   And under that rule, that's why courts applying the treaties will be -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, it didn't quite do that, because, as I looked at its remedy, it -- it chose not to have you fix culverts that were -- were degradating the fish, but it said they can wait until the normal life of the culvert ends. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Your Honor, that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And so -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And it also gave you leeway, rather substantial leeway, 200 culverts, I think, or over 200, not to fix at all.   So what the court does -- did was take your plan and accelerate it.   You made the judgment already. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Your Honor, the court told us we could defer until the end of the useful life culverts that had less than 200 meters upstream of useful habitat. So the -- the -- those are culverts that will make extremely little difference to be replaced, and each one costs several million dollars.   So that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And the court excluded those? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, the court said that those are the ones we could do at the end of the useful -- at the end of the useful life. The court -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yeah, well, that means, because if you don't do it then -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Fair enough, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- it's going to fall down.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " My -- my point is the court did not exclude ones even where there's another barrier 10 yards upstream or 10 yards downstream that the state does not control. So we have to replace culverts even where no salmon can reach them.   And that is an utter waste of public funds and -- and -- and unreasonable even under the Respondents' theory here. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But they gave you the discretion to exclude those? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " No.   The -- the judge said that we could defer culverts blocking 10 percent of the habitat. But that -- that -- the problem is that that doesn't -- it measures it in exactly the wrong way.   So we could -- we could -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It gave you the choice to measure it. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " No, no.   It measures by how much habitat is upstream regardless of other barriers.   So the state is more incentivized under this ruling to replace a culvert that has 10 miles of habitat upstream even if there are five downstream barriers that prevent any salmon even from reaching the state barrier.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I think your adversaries told me that there aren't hardly any culverts downstream, that virtually all of them are upstream from you. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " I don't think they would characterize it that way, and if they would, it's incorrect, Your Honor.   We showed in -- in our reply brief, at the end of our reply brief, a sample of 315 state culverts; 220 had downstream barriers.   So it's not -- it's -- it's true that many more barriers may be upstream, but there are still hundreds and hundreds downstream. And that -- this all highlights, Your Honor, the -- the first treaty point, that the -- the Respondents should have to prove the effect of specific state culverts on particular rivers.   And that just was completely glossed over by the district court here. The -- the fact that a tribe -- each tribe has its own separate treaty fishing rights and its own historic fishing places. And a tribe near Seattle might well be able to show that culverts on a stream near Seattle are affecting its right of taking fish.   That doesn't say anything about the effect of culverts on the Olympic peninsula hundreds of miles away, where the culvert might be in a completely different place in the watershed, there might be different species of salmon, there might be other habitat issues, and that the district court didn't just -- just didn't require at all that -- that type of evidence about the effect on particular rivers. And that's also crucial under this Court's decision in Fishing Vessel, where the Court said that the treaty right of -- of sharing fish is measured on a river-by-river basis. So -- so it's really crucial that the analysis be done in that more precise way. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I'm just still having a hard time.   As I understood it, the district -- the district court essentially took your plan of remediation that was going to take 99 years, and it condensed it to 17.   So it took all of your own studies and your own decisions about priority and what needed to be done on what time level and what studies needed to be done to accelerate what projects faster than others, and gave you the opening to come back and tell them why you were wrong and why something should be deferred or not.   And you just didn't participate in the injunction. So why should we remand to do something you refused to do when given the opportunity? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " First of all, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit was incorrect when it said we refused to participate in the injunction.   The -- the plaintiffs filed a proposed injunction.   One week later, we filed a post-trial brief that raised every single objection I'm raising here today.   If you look at Joint Appendix 28, it's Docket Entry 663, the -- the -- the filing itself is not in the appendix, but it's available on PACER.   And if you read it, you'll see we raised every single objection I'm raising here.   We also raised them at closing argument several months later. Three years passed, and the district court entered the exact injunction that Respondents had asked for, without -- without addressing any of the concerns we raised.   And so -- so it's just not right; the Ninth Circuit was just incorrect when it said that -- that we had not participated.   We -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could you say -- could you say again what -- what you think the standard is? The treaty talks about the right of taking fish. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What do you think that means? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, it's clear that it guarantees three important rights, Your Honor, this Court has recognized: A right to access historic fishing places.   That's Winans.   A right of fair share of the available fish. That's Fishing Vessel.   And then a right to be free of certain types of state actions that are not justified by substantial public interest. And -- and applied here, we think that means that the -- the plaintiffs need to show that state barriers are causing a large decline in a particular river and that it's not justified by substantial public interest. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And what do -- what is the difference between that and the federal government's position about substantially degrading the supply of salmon? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, Your Honor, for one thing, it's not -- I'm not -- I'm not sure whether they would limit their rule to obstructions.   And -- and we think that that's important because the parties stipulated early in this case, at Petition Appendix 173 to 74, that that's all this case was about.   So that's one potential difference.   It's also what all the briefing here is focused on. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   But as to this case, which involves -- supposed obstructions -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- that's not a difference between the two positions. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Okay.   I just -- I just wanted -- that's important. So, second, the way they've defined substantial degradation here, it -- it -- as we explained in our brief, that the highest estimate they gave of the effect of culverts on salmon is a fraction of 1 percent of historic harvests.   So, if you define it that way, it just -- the treaties become a catch-all environmental statute that will regulate every significant activity in the Northwest, so -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So what -- again, what -- they say substantial degradation, and you say what? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " We -- we said large decline, Your Honor.   But, again, I'm not -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " A large decline. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " I'm not being -- I don't want to be picky about the word.   The word is less important to us than the concept that it be meaningful.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What does it mean? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I don't understand what either of those things means. I don't know whether it's substantial degradation or a large decline. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, it -- it has to be more than -- than a fraction of 1 percent of historic harvests or 5 percent of recent harvests.   We think, for example, certainly a decline of half the salmon would certainly easily qualify, but they haven't alleged -- you don't -- I don't think you need to -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, do you have a number in your head? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, again, I think that a decline of half or anything approaching half would obviously be a large decline, a substantial decline, but certainly something between 1 and 5 percent is not a substantial decline.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, 5 percent is often deemed a material number in other contexts of law.   So why wouldn't it be here? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " A 5 percent decline in stock price or something like that is often used as a point of reference in -- in securities law, for example. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Several points about that, Your Honor.   First of all, the -- the 5 percent was -- we were just saying that's 5 percent from very recent harvest levels.   So that essentially holds against the state every other thing that has reduced salmon numbers, including federal dams and many, many other actions.   So, essentially, it's saying -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, now that's a causation argument as opposed to a materiality argument.   They're two different elements. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Fair enough.   I guess what I'm saying is that the denominator matters.   When you measure from is important. And what the plaintiffs are asking me to do is to say when we file our lawsuit, it's -- it's causing 5 percent of the decline. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Again, I understand the causation argument.   There might be other causes for the 5 percent decline and -- and you'd want to argue those.   But is 5 percent, if they could show that 5 percent is attributable to the culverts, would that suffice to -- to satisfy you? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " I don't think it -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And, if not, I guess I'm where Justice Kagan is.   What's -- what's your number? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, again, I think, you know, something approaching half would obviously qualify.   I don't think 5 percent should suffice because otherwise, again, the range of things that -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So the -- so the treaty -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " -- will affect 5 percent of the salmon -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- the treaty, which guarantees the right to all usual and customary fishing grounds, really means half of them? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " No, no, no.   No, that's -- that's not what I mean at all, Your Honor. We're talking about measuring in a particular river what has the decline been. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I don't even understand why it's -- why decline or degradation matters.   Suppose that there were more salmon than anybody knew what to do with and then there was -- the state did something that caused a decline.   Would -- would that be a violation of the treaty? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " I don't think that would be a violation even under the Respondents' theory, Your Honor.   I don't -- I don't think that would be, no.   And -- and -- and -- and that recognizes the crucial other piece of language that -- that is in the treaties, is that the treaties ceded control of the off-reservation land to the future government to regulate in the public interest. And so the government has to have the ability to make some types of decisions, even if they affect the treaty fishing right when there are substantial interests involved. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I guess that's -- for me, I think that's really where the case boils down, and -- and -- and I'm struggling with that.   Right? You -- you assert that you have rights to pursue other public goods and that those can outweigh the treaty, effectively. And -- and -- and so any violation of these culverts has to be weighed against the benefits they provide to other persons.   But -- but -- but doesn't that potentially eliminate the treaty altogether, and doesn't -- wouldn't it defeat it entirely? The point of a treaty I -- I would have thought would have been to -- to freeze in time certain rights and -- and to ensure their existence in perpetuity, regardless of what other social benefits a later municipality might be able to claim. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Your Honor, we're not saying at all that they outweigh the treaty. We're saying that the treaty recognized -- in the treaty, it recognized that there were other interests, that there were -- the future government would regulate the off-reservation land.   And it's just not plausible that the -- that the parties intended that the tribes would be -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Surely, it allowed -- the whole point of the treaty was to give up land.   I understand that. But it -- I don't see anything in the treaty -- maybe you can point it to me, maybe I'm just missing it textually -- anything in the treaty that says: Ah, and your rights to those usual and customary grounds and stations is limited by, and may be completely eliminated, if necessary, to meet other domestic interests that a municipality might have, which is, I think, the position you're taking, I think, before this Court. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Not exactly, Your Honor. The treaty right -- first of all, there's the cession language.   There's the right in common. And then, if you look at this Court's decisions in the Puyallup cases, this Court said that the state could completely shut down fishing, if necessary, for important state interests. That case was only about conservation, but the principle has to be broader, like, things like public safety or public health. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Why? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, for example -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Why does it have to be broader? I would have thought a treaty would have been the supreme law of the land and would have overridden any municipal interests and -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " We're saying it considered those.   It considers those.   And so, for example, the state sometimes has to shut down all shellfish -- shellfish harvesting, excuse me, because of elevated bacteria levels in the water.   And that affects Indian and non-Indian shellfish harvesters. And, obviously, that affects the right of taking fish.   The state's saying no one can harvest any shellfish right now.   And I can't imagine that the other side would say that's a treaty violation, you know. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I don't understand what we're -- this discussion.   I'm having trouble for this reason: I thought that the district court had said -- and I can't get the number -- but that since treaty times, the number of the fish have declined alarmingly. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I don't know what \"alarmingly\" is supposed to refer to, but I think probably a lot. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Then in the -- there's a Finding 161 where he says, if you look at the whole watershed, the water -- the -- the -- barrier culverts are accounting for 6 to 13 percent of the decline.   And if you look at the tributaries, it's 44 percent to 58 percent. All right.   When I read something like that, I thought, well, that's a lot, so I don't have to worry about that issue.   Now -- now -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- now you're going to tell me why I do have to worry about it. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " I will. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Then I went and looked at what the court of appeals held, and it said we're not -- if there's an act of God or some good reason, you know, so on and so forth, we're not saying you have to replace it, but we are saying where -- where nothing like that is -- is present, you do.   Okay? On this schedule, which is the schedule -- now do I have it all wrong? Yes? Okay.   You can -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " I don't want to say you have it all wrong, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What have I got? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " But you have some parts of it wrong. So two things.   Number one, that was a study of a single river and it was a study of all barriers on that river, not state culverts. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah, but, I mean, I can't go back and review -- I can, but, I mean, it's pretty hard to start reviewing the details of a district court record -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, it -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- unless there's something that you've told the court of appeals and told everybody else this is clearly wrong and so forth, which I haven't found. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " But the -- the district court didn't make any finding that that was a sort of across-the-board effect.   It was just citing a study about one river.   And in that river, the effect of all barriers, not state culverts, all barriers was 6 to 13 percent of -- of the salmon. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " They said that was the whole watershed.   So, apparently, you're saying that if, in fact, I looked at the record, I would discover that you showed it was very much lower -- in fact, that number is wrong -- and, therefore, don't make this finding, and it's clearly erroneous and that the court of appeals didn't consider it and that we should reverse on that ground. Now I haven't found that in your brief, I take it. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " That's -- that's not what I'm saying, Your Honor.   I'm saying if the district court had said I'm analyzing -- I believe that was about the Skagit River -- I'm analyzing the Skagit River, and the Skagit River state culverts are causing 35 percent of the decline in salmon runs. We're saying that might well be a treaty violation if there weren't good reasons why -- if there weren't substantial justifications of public interest for those culverts. And -- and -- but that's not at all what the district court did.   The district court didn't say anything about the effects, other than citing that one study about particular rivers or particular places, and -- and it varies dramatically. I mean, just as that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, General -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " -- as that finding of fact shows, the effect in tributaries is dramatically different than the effect in larger bodies of water. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " General, just to take you back to Justice Gorsuch's question, because I think you just gave an answer and it went something like this: It said if there were a 30 percent decline and it wasn't for good reason, then there would be a treaty violation. So now we have a number.   It says 30 percent.   But -- but -- but you are continually putting in this, and it has to be reasonless, it has to be unjustified, there can't be any reason why the state is doing what it's doing.   And -- and like Justice Gorsuch, I'm wondering where that is in the treaty. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, I think it's in the -- in the cession language, in the \"in common with\" language -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What -- what language are we pointing to? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " The -- the fact that the tribes ceded control over off-reservation land to the future government to regulate. And, Your Honor, if you don't adopt that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But this is -- I mean, that cuts against you, General, because this is a compact, a contract, made into federal law in which the Indians gave up a very substantial thing.   It gave up all their land. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And it got something in return, which is the right to take fish. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Absolutely.   And we're saying there would need to be very substantial public interest, but at least that should be considered.   So, for example, under the other side's theory, every single hydroelectric dam in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But where does this public interest theory come in in the treaty? I thought this was an agreement.   I give you my land.   You give me the right to take fish.   And -- and let's just even make it narrower here. The right -- I -- I have the right that you will not put up obstructions on these streams such that I can't take fish. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well, Your Honor, if -- if the rule is narrowly limited like that, it's much less problematic for the state, but there's also not -- the findings would not support that rule, and it would outlaw every dam in the Northwest.   So it's -- it's inconsistent with the parties' long-standing behavior. The federal government built and licensed dams throughout the Northwest for decades starting in the early 1900s that completely obstructed rivers and decimated salmon populations, often over the state's objection.   So, if they're right that all you need to show is an obstruction and that -- some level of decline, every single one of those dams is a treaty violation.   Now those aren't state dams. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They -- they could -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " We're not -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " We've had cases that have basically said, the example you used -- if we're going to regulate fishing for the purposes of ensuring that there isn't degradation of fish, bacteria, some other form of fishing that -- that would be more harmful than -- than your catch, we've said that's okay, but if you're going to degradate for the benefit of the landowners, as opposed to the people entitled to the fish, that you can't do that because you have to make sure that the Indians receive their fair amount of the -- of the catch. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So your substantial public need is not creating that difference for me. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Okay.   Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's -- it's not defining what type of public need is -- is proper. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Right.   And that's fair enough, Your Honor.   We think that to -- to define that, courts -- the district court could look at factors like those that Respondents have cited under the common law.   Is this a total barrier? What are the public benefits of it? Was it justified by law? Was it authorized by law? Those sorts of things. But to be -- and just is it -- is taking it out going to require a waste of public funds, as many of the culverts here would? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, I'm sorry, if -- if you could have built this bridge in a way to permit the free flow of fish, you seem to be saying that you can get out of that obligation merely because you wanted to spend less money. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " No, not at all, Your Honor.   Not at all.   We're -- we're saying we might well -- under the theory I'm saying, there are -- I'm confident there are culverts that we've already taken out that would have violated this test.   And they -- they had -- you know, they -- they were blocking a significant number of fish on a particular river and there was -- cost-wise, it -- there was no good reason to leave them in. I -- I'm -- I'm not saying we will always win under this test.   I think, for example, the dams the federal government recently removed on the Elwha River, which will bring back more salmon than all the culverts in this case combined, is the estimate, those were -- probably violate this test that I'm saying. I'm not trying to set out a test the tribes can never meet. My point is just they haven't met either this test or -- or even their own test in the -- in the district court.   The district court didn't apply this test because it wasn't before him.   He didn't even find that the -- that the state's barrier culverts were all obstructions under the theory they're advancing here because half the state's barrier culverts are only partial obstructions.   And this -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Which -- which test did you say the district court did not consider? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " The -- the idea that -- that -- as I understand their theory here, it's that obstructions that cause a substantial degradation are a treaty violation.   And -- and the phrase \"substantial degradation\" doesn't appear anywhere in the Ninth Circuit opinion, the briefing to the Ninth Circuit, the district court opinion.   And -- and also, the way they've defined obstruction here is -- is essentially under the common law.   And the common law allowed partial barriers, that's very clear. And -- and that just wasn't at issue in the district court.   So at least half of the barriers that -- that are what we define as barrier culverts under state policy allow many fish to pass, up to 90 -- a barrier can be up to 90 -- sorry, a culvert can be up to 90 percent passable and -- and the state still has made a policy choice to define that as a barrier culvert that we are going to remove at some point -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " -- but that doesn't make it a treaty violation. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- the common law cases that we were able to find say things like -- there's a good Massachusetts case here -- I just say it's good because it's from Massachusetts. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

It seems to me there is no disagreement, perhaps, on the common law tradition that a nuisance could consist of simply blocking fish from coming up a river into your area.   And then it seems to me the Indians ought to have at least as much right as a person had under the common law, given the treaty.   And then we seem to be arguing about what counts as an amount. And when I read through the briefs, I came away with the impression, well, whatever the amount is, there's certainly a lot of fish being blocked by the culverts.   Now -- now -- now, suddenly here, I think, well, you're arguing, no, no, there weren't a lot.   There were just a few.   And I don't know quite how to deal with that argument.

And so it's really only our reply brief that addresses the arguments they're making now. In the Ninth Circuit and the district court, the argument was any diminishment from historic harvest levels is -- is a treaty violation.   And that's essentially what the district court found and what the Ninth Circuit upheld.   So what we're saying now is at the -- at least, I'll say at least, at least there should be a remand for application of this -- of this new theory because there's all sorts of evidence that wasn't relevant before that would be relevant now, like the fact about partial barriers, the fact that, as I said, half of the state's \"barrier culverts\" allow many fish to pass. And the district court just adopted our list, which we made for good policy reasons, but that -- but it doesn't mean that a partial barrier is a treaty violation just because, you know, 10 percent of fish can't get through it. So if there's -- if the Court, you know, has concerns about the -- the details of -- of the facts and such, keep in mind the district court found liability, of -- the state had violated the treaties, on summary judgment. I mean, the -- the district court held us liable on summary judgment.   So saying the factual issues essentially don't matter, back in 2007, the whole trial was just about the remedy. So -- so, I mean, you know, if -- if the Court disagrees with the rule we're saying here and it wants to adopt some version of theirs, the appropriate course would be to remand with direction to the district court.

We're pointing to the course of negotiation between the parties, the fact that Washington's organic statute required that any structure put into a river or stream ensure fish passage.   We're also relying on this -- this Court's own cases, which have recognized that protection of the resource is the central concern of these treaties. If I could move to this 1 percent of historic harvests number that my friend gives, I think that's wrong both on the numerator and on the denominator. For the numerator, he's talking about a 200,000 fish figure that, first of all, the district court did not credit and, second of all, comes from a 1997 state agency report that was based on 250 linear miles of habitat being opened up.   But, here, we're talking about approximately four of -- four times that much, 1,000 linear miles. Moreover, with respect to the denominator, we're not talking about historical harvests.

It's forfeited because it was raised for the first time in the reply brief before this Court.   It's waived because it's contrary to the joint stipulation of the parties on which the district court relied using the state's own definition of what it means to be a barrier culvert.

And -- and for that reason, we -- what we think the Court should focus on is the -- the actual basis for the injunction, the liability ruling and then the injunction itself and whether the injunction is an abuse of discretion. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " And how would you phrase that, if not moderate living? What would be the determine -- what would be the standard that you think should be applied in interpreting the injunction? "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " In interpreting the injunction? Well, we think that the reason an injunction was justified in this case is because the state has violated the treaty by, one, putting barrier culverts in the streams that prevent salmon and other anadromous fish from getting to the usual and accustomed fishing grounds, all of which -- all of which are places where the state -- the tribes have a right to fish. And, second, those blockages -- those same blockages are what is degrading the fishery in a substantial way.   And that -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Do your clients agree with the United States that the dams that were built by the United States are in compliance with the treaty? "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " So let me -- let me give just a conceptual answer.   The -- not all dams block fish passage.   I mean, as my friend Mr. Kedem said and as is reflected in Section 18 of the Federal Power Act and its predecessor going back to 1906, various executive agencies have had the power to require fishways, you know, devices for ensuring fish passage around dams. So simply saying there were dams is not in any way to say there was an obstruction to fish passage. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, I understand that, but there are particular dams on particular rivers, and I wonder if your clients have a position as to whether those are in compliance with the treaty, as the government has told us this morning. "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " Well, what I can say is that when the federal government has built dams without ensuring fish passage, that the federal government quite appropriately has paid compensation to the Indian tribes in exchange for the destruction of its usual and accustomed fishing grounds and the inability to take fish there. So, certainly, a dam or another obstruction that blocks a usual and accustomed fishing ground can be a violation, but there's nothing in the record in this case, because it has not been litigated, about particular dams that don't meet that standard. My friend from the state talked about the idea that the state's -- some of the state's barriers are partial barriers, and there are a number of things I'd like to say about that. First is the idea that the common law did not prohibit partial barriers to passage. That is simply incorrect.   I think that this is discussed in detail at pages 17 to 20 of the Law Professors' amicus brief. On page 20, it says it is at this point clear -- this is in the -- in the 1800s -- that partial barriers to fish passage are prohibited as well.   And that is not surprising, because a barrier to fish passage is an obstruction, even if a single particularly strong fish can get upstream. Now there's -- I would be happy to go into great detail about what the tests should be, but in this case, you don't have to get into that because the state stipulated -- stipulated expressly to -- to the definition of barrier culverts.   And that is why the injunction in this case is tailored to, number one, streams that are suitable for salmon only; number two, barrier culverts using the state's own definition only; number three, barrier culverts that block a significant stretch of habitat. And it has a fourth safeguard as well, which is that the state can decline to remediate up -- up to 10 percent of the habitat, which we think could add up to more than 200 yards -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But there's still 600 -- there are about 600 and something left. Suppose they discover -- "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " Five-hundred something. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Because that's a lot of them, when they go out there, that there are like five culverts somewhere which would be unbelievably expensive to change, and, moreover, it would really save only three fish or something. Now suppose that they find that out. Can they go back into the district court and say: Judge, we would like you to modify this in respect to those five? "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " That's exactly what, at page 125, of the Petition Appendix you will see that the court of appeals underscored, that the district court retains equitable discretion under this Court's cases, applying Rule 60, to modify the injunction if changed circumstances warrant it. And the -- the court of appeals said that it's confident that the district court, which has supervised this case, these proceedings, and this injunction for a long, long time will exercise its discretion appropriately. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Do -- do you think, Mr. Jay, that this -- that these treaty obligations differ at all from the reigning common law principles? And, if so, how? "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " I agree with what Mr. Kedem said, that the common law is a guide to what the -- to what the treaties' protected right of taking fish means.   I think that the reason that it is a guide and not -- not a codification rests in the fact that it is a treaty between the United States and the Indian tribes. The Indian tribes, of course, were not thoroughly familiar with the English common law, but what the tribes did understand was that obstructions to the salmon fishery were a threat to the continued survival of the -- of the species.   That's why the tribes themselves had adopted the practice of removing obstructions to permit the survival. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But what I'm really -- "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " My second point -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- asking is when you look at the common law and you look at this treaty, do you see any difference between the two -- "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " The -- the -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- and where would that difference be? "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " The principal difference, I think, is on this point that Mr. Purcell brought up, the idea that there could be some public interest balancing.   Now we don't -- we agree with Mr. Kedem that that's not what the common law says writ large about nuisance, but it is true that nuisance was a common law creation. The legislature could supersede nuisance in particular instances by passing a statute saying this shall not be a nuisance. The state and locale -- and local governments don't have the power to do that because this right of taking fish is secured by a federal treaty. So it's not that the treaty embodies only a promise that you will have the right of taking fish so long as the state and local governments decide not to abrogate it.   Only Congress can abrogate a treaty with the Indian tribes, and that certainly makes sense, given the exchange that is effected by these treaties. The problem -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Jay, what do I look at? I know the district court made certain findings about the costs of remediation.   The state has always said it's $2.13 billion.   I know the district court said that wasn't true, that, on average, the remediation of 12 or 15 culverts to date have cost, on average, $600,000. "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What can I look at to tell me what the cost is projected to be? I -- I just need a realistic number, and I wasn't sure I got it from anybody. "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " Yeah.   I think, Your Honor, you've looked at the right parts of the opinion.   I would also point you to 119a where the court of appeals explains why the state's total estimate is \"demonstrably incorrect.\" "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Six hundred million dollars is still a lot of money. "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " I don't think it would be $600 million, I mean, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There are 600 -- I'm on average. "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " Right, it's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Six hundred culverts, you're right, he -- he said it was like $650,000 per culvert, so you're right, maybe half that.   It's still a lot of money. "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " It -- it is a lot of money. Of course, in the context of the state's transportation budget, in -- at that figure, we think it's about a half a percent of the state's transportation budget.   But I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And I know there's some federal money coming. "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " There is federal money coming in.   There are -- there are other sources of funding as well that are remediating both state and local and private culverts, but I think that, when looking at the cost, I think what you have to see is that much of the cost comes not from like the designing of the culvert or the -- what kind of culvert you put in but the choice to remediate the culvert. Now -- and it's very important to notice that Washington State has had a law requiring fish passage.   And the attorney general of Washington opined in 1950 -- 1950 -- that culverts installed by the State Highway Department under state roads had to meet those requirements for fish passage. So, if the state decided not to do that and to install non-compliant culverts, culverts that blocked fish passage, and it's going to cost, you know, a fairly substantial sum to remediate them, the state bears a -- a fair amount of that responsibility itself. Now, ultimately, the district court in its discretion looked at those costs, looked at the state's argument about whether it would be worthwhile, balanced the equities, and concluded that the balance of the harms tipped substantially in the tribes' favor and in the favor of the public interest. And I think that this is well brought out by the non-Indian fishermen's brief, both commercial and recreational fishermen, who explain in detail why it's very consistent with the public interest to resolve this problem on the tailored scale -- tailored timetable that the district court set out. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Purcell, you have five minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to make three points.   First, counsel for the United States pointed you to paragraph 4.1 at Joint Appendix 62a.   I'd urge you to turn to it and look at it. He -- he stopped reading part way through.   It says, \"has a duty not to build or maintain culverts in a way that deprives the tribes of a moderate living from fishing.\" Moderate living came from their -- that's their complaint.   That's the equivalent of their complaint in this case.   The district court understood their complaint that way, if you look at Petition Appendix 250a.   He described their claim as seeking a moderate living from fishing. The phrase \"moderate living\" appears dozens of times in the briefs to the Ninth Circuit.   The phrase \"substantial degradation\" doesn't appear a single time in any brief to the Ninth Circuit.   That was not the argument. So I raise that point not to emphasize that -- that they should be barred from raising that argument here but just to emphasize that if the Court's going to adopt some version of that test, really the appropriate -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Some -- the sentence says, \"in the context of state culverts that appreciably degrade fish passage and interfere with the tribe's ability to obtain a moderate\" -- so they have to do both: One, appreciably inter -- degrade fish passage; and two, also interfere with the moderate standing. Isn't that what it says? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " That's what they claimed, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, that's what it seemed to me to say. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " The -- the district court essentially said the moderate living standard -- any decline from that is a violation.   And all the factual findings they're citing, Your Honor, keep in mind that was after the district court had already held that the state violated the treaties. The -- the violation finding was on summary judgment.   And what the district court said -- I encourage you to turn to actually the same page that Mr. Jay said, Petition Appendix 263a, the district court said, \"the tribes find that harvests have been diminished, together with the logical inference that a significant portion of this diminishment is due to blocked culverts, is sufficient to support a finding of a treaty violation.\" So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, I -- I -- you know, I -- I have read the language.   I don't understand exactly why the district court did it.   I think the circuit court tried to clarify it. But, as I understand things, the Indians are entitled to 50 percent, but we have said it doesn't have to be more than a moderate living.   So it could be less than 50 percent of whatever the catch is. Am I correct on that? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " In Fishing Vessel, the Court said the tribe -- each side is entitled to half the available fish. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Right.   And unless? "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Unless less than that is sufficient to provide a moderate living. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Exactly.   As I understand what the government said to me earlier, you stipulated that a moderate living wasn't at issue.   So you weren't claiming, I don't think, as a defense that the existing catch was more than sufficient or exceeded a moderate living by so much that we didn't have to fix the culverts because of that reason. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " We said we would not dispute that the tribes were not currently earning a moderate living from fishing.   And that's why -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " -- the district court said I don't need to define this term. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So it doesn't really matter.   Once there's significant degradation, that means they're not getting 50 percent of what they need. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " No, Your Honor.   This Court in Fishing Vessel said 50 percent is the maximum, even if it's less than the tribe's moderate living needs.   That's what the Court said in Fishing Vessel. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yes, but -- but what I'm saying to you is, if you stipulated that they're not making a moderate living, they're still entitled to 50 percent of the undegradated catch. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " That's not what the Court held in Fishing Vessel at all, Your Honor.   The Court held 50 percent of the currently available catch.   If that had been the rule, they would have been entitled to every single fish -- the -- the -- the undegradated catch, Your Honor, would be tens of millions of salmon.   And it's undisputed that -- that -- that the -- the runs have declined vastly long before the state built any culverts.   That's -- that's not what the Court said. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Then my words are -- are wrong.   They caught X amount.   If the proof is that Y amount would have happened absent the obstruction, they're entitled to 50 percent of Y amount.   I don't care what caused the decimation. "}, {"speaker": "Noah Purcell", "text": " Again, that's not the Court -- the approach the Court took in Fishing Vessel.   And if the Court's going to remand with some sort of direction that the district -- I would urge the Court that if you're going to say some version of that, the appropriate course is to remand to the district court because the district court just did not consider these arguments.   The district court -- it's -- I mean, we didn't waive the idea that these aren't all obstructions.   That wasn't an issue. The definition -- the common law definition of obstruction was never raised in the district court by the other parties.   We had no opportunity to make that point. We did in our post-trial brief, again, at Joint Appendix 28, we argued extensively about the flaws in the injunction. Every single flaw -- Justice Breyer asked, why can't we go back to the district court? We already pointed out all of these flaws to the district court and -- and he ignored them and entered the exact injunction that they proposed. And -- and so that's -- that's the concern.   It flips the burden of proof on its head to say, okay, we're going to assume that all state barrier culverts, regardless of where they are or anything about the river or anything like that, is a violation, and then you can go back and ask for relief. I see my time has expired.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
