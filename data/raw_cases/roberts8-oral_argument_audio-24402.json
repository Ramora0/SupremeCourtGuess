[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 16-111, Masterpiece Cakeshop versus Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Ms. Waggoner. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The First Amendment prohibits the government from forcing people to express messages that their violate religious convictions.   Yet the Commission requires Mr. Phillips to do just that, ordering him to sketch, sculpt, and hand-paint cakes that celebrate a view of marriage in violation of his religious convictions. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can I ask you -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What if -- what if it's a -- if it's an item off the shelf? That is, they don't commission a cake just for them but they walk into the shop, they see a lovely cake, and they say we'd like to purchase it for the celebration of our marriage tonight. The Colorado law would prohibit that. Would you claim that you are entitled to an exception? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Absolutely not.   The compelled speech doctrine is triggered by compelled speech.   And in the context of a pre-made cake, that is not compelled speech. Mr. Phillips is happy to sell anything in his store, including -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, didn't -- didn't he express himself when he made it? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Yes, he did express himself when he made it.   And the purpose for which he expressed it is important to the compelled speech doctrine and how it applies, but when he -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry, he did refuse to sell -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, could I -- but could I get the answer to the question? So -- so -- so if it -- if you agree that it's speech, then why can he not refuse to sell the cake that's in the window according to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Well, in the context of if it's already been placed in the stream of commerce in a public accommodation setting, his speech has been completed.   He -- he intended to speak through that cake with the purpose of whatever it was when he created it. In contrast, though, when he has a different purpose, and is expressing a message through a cake, it would render a different result.   It's still speech. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry, didn't he refuse to sell cupcakes that he sells regularly to the public to some same-sex couples who intended to marry? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " That allegation was never involved in the complaint, the formal charges, the ALJ's decision. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But I thought -- I'm a little bit surprised by what you're saying because your brief seemed to suggest differently -- that the couple was looking at his already pre-designed cakes that he appears to sell without any customization, and they sat down with him, and he said I don't supply cakes of any kind to gay couples. So I thought this cake was about his refusal to supply a cake for any wedding ceremony. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, that's not how he responded to the couple.   The couple came in and they requested a custom cake for their wedding.   At that point, they brought in a folder with all kinds of designs they wanted to discuss and ended up purchasing a rainbow-layered cake or -- or received a free rainbow-layered cake, which certainly is expression. The order below requires Mr. Phillips also to include words and symbols on his cakes. It's that broad.   So if, for example, Mr. Phillips had used a Bible verse on a cake in the past, he would be compelled to use that Bible verse in a different context. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Where does it -- where does it say -- I -- I thought that the requirement was he supply a custom-made cake, as he would to any other shopper, but that he didn't have to convey somebody else's message; that is, he didn't have to write anything on the cake. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " In Petitioners' Appendix 57(a), the order is provided, and that order requires him to provide anything that he would provide on a cake in another setting for a marriage between a man and a woman, which includes words and images that he would provide on -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, suppose we exclude that and say let's make the assumption that he -- if he makes custom-made cakes for others, he must make it for this pair, but he doesn't have to write anything for anybody.   He doesn't have to write a message that he disagrees with. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Well, this Court has recognized in Hurley as well as in other decisions that artistic expression doesn't need to include words and symbols to express a message or to be protected speech. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, just -- just one more thing, and then we'll leave this part alone, so at least as far as I'm concerned. Suppose the couple goes in and sees the cake in the window and the cake has a biblical verse. Does he have to sell that cake? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Under our theory, he would need to sell that cake because he's already created that cake with the message that he intended for it, but we are drawing the line prior to the compulsion -- there can be no compulsion of speech. If the Court were to choose to draw that line in a different place and protect more speech, there certainly is precedent for that. But under the compelled speech doctrine, when someone comes in and requests speech, if that speech has already been created, then that would be -- not be compelled. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could you tell me how far -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " There's no -- there's no -- there's no compulsion of speech, but if he is required to sell a cake in the window with the message already on it, that is compelling him to associate that message with the ceremony.   And I thought that was something to which you objected. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " There would possibly be an expressive association claim and potentially a free exercise claim if he was delivering the cake and there was other involvement.   But in terms of the Court's application of the compelled speech doctrine, the compulsion is the trigger for that, but the Court could draw that line at an earlier place and not force him to sell that cake. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But your -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Ms. -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- the question that I started out with, I -- I wanted to clarify that what you're talking about is a custom-made cake.   You are not challenging his obligation to sell his ordinary wares, his, as you put it, already-made wares? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Not at all.   And, in fact, Mr. Phillips offered the couple anything in his store, as well as offered to sell additional cakes, custom cakes, that would express other messages. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Going -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Ms. Waggoner -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- you mentioned -- you brought up Hurley, but in Hurley, the parade was the event.   It was the speech, a parade.   At a wedding ceremony, I take it, the speech is of the people who are marrying and perhaps the officiant, but who -- who else speaks at a wedding? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " The artist speaks, Justice Ginsburg.   It's as much Mr. Phillips's speech as it would be the couples'.   And in Hurley, the Court found a violation of the compelled speech doctrine. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Who else then? Who else as an artist? Say the -- the person who does floral arranging, owns a floral shop. Would that person also be speaking at the wedding? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " If the -- if they are custom-designed arrangements and they are being forced to create artistic expression which this Court determines is a message -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " How about -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So could -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- the person who designs the invitation? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The invitation to the wedding or the menu for the wedding dinner? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Certainly, words and symbols would be protected speech, and the question would be whether the objection is to the message provided or if it's to the person. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So the jeweler? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " It would depend on the context as all free-speech cases depend on. What is the jeweler asked to do? "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The hairstylist? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Absolutely not. There's no expression or protected speech in that kind of context, but what it would -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why is there no speech in -- in creating a wonderful hairdo? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Well, it may be artistic, it may be creative, but what the Court asks when there's -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The makeup artist? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " No.   What the Court would ask -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It's called an artist. It's the makeup artist. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " The makeup artist may, again, be using creativity and artistry, but when this Court is looking at whether speech is involved, it asks the question of is it communicating something, and is it analogous to other protected -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I'm -- "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " -- forms of speech. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- I'm quite serious, actually, about this, because, you know, a makeup artist, I think, might feel exactly as your client does, that they're doing something that's of -- of great aesthetic importance to the -- to the wedding and to -- and that there's a lot of skill and artistic vision that goes into making a -- somebody look beautiful. And why -- why wouldn't that person or the hairstylist -- why wouldn't that also count? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Because it's not speech.   And that's the first trigger point of this case -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, some people might say that about cakes, you know? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Some -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But you have a -- you have a view that a cake can be speech because it -- it involves great skill and artistry. And I guess I'm wondering, if that's the case, you know, how do you draw a line? How do you decide, oh, of course, the chef and the baker are on one side, and you said, I think, the florist is on that side, the chef, the baker, the florist, versus the hairstylist or the makeup artist? I mean, where would you put a tailor, a tailor who makes a wonderful suit of clothes? Where does that come in? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Your Honor, the tailor is not engaged in speech, nor is the chef engaged in speech but, again, this Court -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But why well, why -- well -- woah.   The baker is engaged in speech, but the chef is not engaged in speech? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " The -- the test that this Court has used in the past to determine whether speech is engaged in is to ask if it's communicating something, and if whatever is being communicated, the medium used is similar to other mediums that this Court has protected. Not -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Does it depend on -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So that begs the question, when have we ever given protection to a food? The primary purpose of a food of any kind is to be eaten. Now, some people might love the aesthetic appeal of a special dessert, and look at it for a very long time, but in the end its only purpose is to be eaten. And the same with many of the things that you've mentioned.   A hairdo is to show off the person, not the artist.   When people at a wedding look at a wedding cake and they see words, as one of the amici here, the pastry chef said, there was a gentleman who had upset his wife and written some words that said \"I'm sorry for what I did,\" something comparable, and the chef was asked -- the cake maker was asked, was that affiliated with you? And she said no.   It's affiliated with the person who shows the cake at their wedding. It's what they wish to show. So how is this your client's expression, and how can we find something whose predominant purpose is virtually always to be eaten? Call it a medium for expressive expression.   Mind you, I can see if they've -- create a cake and put it in a museum as an example of some work of art, that might be different because the circumstances would show that they want this to be affiliated with themselves. But explain how that becomes expressive speech, that medium becomes expressive speech. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Certainly not all cakes would be considered speech, but in the wedding context, Mr. Phillips is painting on a blank canvas.   He is creating a painting on that canvas that expresses messages, and including words and symbols in those messages. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You know, the other night I had some people over and one of them brought a box of cupcakes and one of the cupcakes was smashed against the box.   That was the only cupcake not eaten. Now, I suspect that one of the reasons is the others were so much more attractive whole.   There is creation in serving food, in creating any type of edible product. People -- there are sandwich artists now.   There are people who create beauty in what they make, but we still don't call it expressive and entitled to First Amendment protection. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " No, but when we have someone that is sketching and sculpting and hand designing something, that is creating a temporary sculpture that serves as the centerpiece of what they believe to be a religious wedding celebration, that cake expresses a message. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Is this just a -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What would you say about an architectural design? Is that entitled to -- not entitled to First Amendment protection because one might say that the primary purpose of the design of a building is to create a place where people can live or work? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Precisely.   In the context of an architect, generally that would not be protected because buildings are functionable, not communicative. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You mean an architectural design is not protected? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " No.   Architect -- generally speaking, architecture would not be protected.   It would -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So, in other words, Mies or Michelangelo or someone is not protected when he creates the Laurentian steps, but this cake baker is protected when he creates the cake without any message on it for a wedding? Now, that -- that really does baffle me, I have to say. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Well, I did say generally no in terms of architecture. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right, then, what is the line? That's what everybody's trying to get at, because obviously we've all gone -- I went to a Mexican restaurant.   They have this fabulous Mole specially made for the people at the table to show what important and wonderful evening it was, which it did import -- impart. There are all kinds of restaurants that do that.   And maybe Ollie's Barbecue, you know, maybe Ollie thought he had special barbecue. All right.   Now, the reason we're asking these questions is because obviously we would want some kind of distinction that will not undermine every civil rights law from the -- from -- from the year two -- including the African Americans, including the Hispanic Americans, including everybody who has been discriminated against in very basic things of life, food, design of furniture, homes, and buildings. Now, that is, I think, the point of the question, and I've tried to narrow it and specify it to get your answer. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Thank you, Justice Breyer.   In terms of the test that would be applied, the Court would first ask under the speech analysis, is there speech? And by asking that, you're asking is there something that's being communicated and is it a protected -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And there isn't one of the people I mentioned who doesn't think he's communicating something.   What do you think they're doing when they're making the Essow or the building? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " It's not just about what the individual thinks they're communicating, though.   This Court also routinely makes that inquiry in all kinds of situations in all free-speech cases. Second, though, the Hurley framework provides a framework for this Court to make those decisions and to protect individuals. The way that it does that is it asks: Is the individual who's being compelled to speak objecting to the message that's contained in that speech or the person? And that's usually a very obvious inquiry.   If it's connected -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Would you stop -- would that belief that expresses speech trump public accommodation laws against discrimination or protecting customers from race? Yes or no. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " This Court has never compelled speech in the context of race, but if it were ever to do so -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Oh, it didn't in Newman versus Piggie? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Not in terms of compelling speech. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There was a -- he claimed that he was religious, that he opposed serving blacks because it mixed the races, and we basically refused both his free expression and his free exercise clauses.   So are you saying that your rule now would trump protection against race discrimination? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Respectfully, Your Honor, I don't think this Court has ever compelled speech in the context of -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'll read Newman myself. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, I'm sorry, could I just -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Answer my question. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- understand your -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's your theory -- is your theory that you -- that you -- public accommodation laws cannot trump free speech or free-exercise claims in protecting against race discrimination? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " That is not my theory. That would be an objection to the person and the Court may find a compelling interest in that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But if I could just, sorry, very quickly, I know your light is on and I'm sure you'll be given a little bit of an adjustment.   Is that okay? (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess I just didn't understand your answers to Justice Sotomayor's question.   Same case or not the same case, if your client instead objected to an interracial marriage? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Very different case in that context. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Not the same.   How about if he objected to an interreligious? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Similar case, assuming that the objection is to -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Similar to what? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Similar to Mr. Phillips.   That would be protected under the Compelled Speech doctrine if the objection is to the message being conveyed in that expression. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You're just saying race is different? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " I'm saying yes -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth.   I -- I just really, you know, just want to know the answer. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " I think race is different for two reasons: one, we know that that objection would be based to who the person is, rather than what the message is. And, second, even if that were not the case, the Court could find a compelling interest in the race inquiry just as it did in the Pena-Rodriguez case.   There are no -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how about disability; I'm not going to serve cakes to two disabled people because God makes perfect creations, and there are some religions who believe that?

"}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " -- I'm not aware of any religions that believe that, but, if they did, that would clearly be based on who the person is and not the message in the final product that's -- they're being asked to create. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, your client was saying that providing a cake to a same-sex couple was against his free-expression rights because -- and his free-exercise rights, because he cannot celebrate that kind of marriage. "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Mr. Phillips is looking at not the \"who\" but the \"what\" in these instances, what the message is.   And for 25 years, he -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, actually, counsel, that seems to be a point of contention.   The state seems to concede that if it were the message, your -- your client would have a right to refuse.   But if it -- the objection is to the person, that's when the discrimination law kicks in.   That's Footnote 8 of the Colorado Court of Appeals' decision.   I know you know this. So what do you say to that, that actually what is happening here may superficially look like it's about the message, but it's really about the person's identity? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " I would say that in Footnote 8, the court applies an offensiveness policy, which allows the state the discretion to decide what speech is offensive and what is not, and it did not apply that in a fair way to Mr. Phillips, which creates viewpoint discrimination, as well as a violation of free exercise -- the Free Exercise Clause. But what's deeply concerning is that is not the theory that Respondents are submitting to this Court today.   They believe that they can compel speech, of filmmakers, oil painters, and graphic designers in all kinds of contexts. If there are no further questions, I would reserver -- like to reserve the balance of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll afford you the full rebuttal time.

Francisco", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it -- may it please the Court: This case raises an important issue for a small group of individuals, namely, whether the state may compel business owners, including professional artists, to engage in speech in connection with an expressive event like a marriage celebration to which they're deeply opposed. In those narrow circumstances, we believe the Free Speech Clause provides breathing space -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " How narrow is it? Consider Justice Kagan's question.   I mean, we've gotten the answer that the florist is in the same place as the cake-maker, so is the person who designs the invitations and the menus.   I don't see a line that can be drawn that would exclude the -- the makeup artist or the hairstylist. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Well, Your Honor, that's, of course, a question that the course has -- Court has to answer at the threshold of every Free Speech Case.   Is the thing that's being regulated something we call protected speech? I think the problem for my friends on the other side is that they think the question doesn't even matter.   So they would compel an African-American sculptor to sculpt a cross for a Klan service -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But the problem for you is that so many of these examples -- and a photographer can be included -- do involve speech.   It means that there's basically an ability to boycott gay marriages. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think that what it boils down to is that in a narrow category of services that do cross the threshold into protected speech -- and I do think it's a relatively narrow category -- you do have protection.

A couple of the briefs -- one of the amici briefs pointed out that most military bases are in isolated areas far from cities and that they're in areas where the general population, service population, is of one religion or close to one religious belief.

It's like how about a -- a -- a -- a couple, a same-sex couple goes to a great restaurant with a great chef for an anniversary celebration, and the great chef says I don't do this for same-sex couples?

Francisco", "text": " I think there are a couple of ways to draw that line, and this is something that the Court has to struggle with in a lot of cases.   I think the first way to draw that line is you analogize it to something that everyone regards as traditional art and everyone agrees is protected speech. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Like the Jackson Pollock? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Exactly.   And here you have a cake that is essentially synonymous with a traditional sculpture except for the medium used.   But I also think that the Second Circuit's decision in the Mastrovincenzo case provides a good and workable standard when you've got something that is part art and part utilitarian. And what the Second Circuit asks is, is it predominantly art or predominantly utilitarian? And here people pay very high prices for these highly sculpted cakes, not because they taste good, but because of their artistic qualities. I think the more important point -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " In fact, I have yet to have a -- a wedding cake that I would say tastes great. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Noel J.

"}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " But I think the point is when you cross that threshold into free speech, the question is can you compel somebody to create and contribute speech to an expressive event -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Is it a predominant purpose test -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " -- that they oppose. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " How about this -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- or is it -- would you say it's a predominant purpose or a predominant effect?

Francisco", "text": " I think -- I think both.   And I think one of the key factors that the Second Circuit looks to, it looks to a bunch of different factors, but one factor is price.   Are people paying for the utilitarian side of it or are they paying for the artistic side of it?

Francisco", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " There's a category of people called artisans.   An artisan is a kind of artist.   They're in many fields.   They're also people who are discriminated against.   And we're in a country of minorities, there are many different groups that have been discriminated against. For many years Congress has passed laws saying, at least to the artisans: You cannot discriminate on the basis of -- of race, religion, dah, dah, dah.   Sexual orientation. If we were to write an opinion for you, what would we have done to that principle? And, of course, the concern is that we would have caused chaos with that principle across the board because there is no way of confining an opinion on your side in a way that doesn't do that.   So tell me how. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think that the way you do it is because none of these Courts' cases has ever involved requiring somebody to create speech and contribute that speech to an expressive event to which they are deeply opposed. And if I could go back to my example, when you force that African-American sculptor to sculpt that cross for a Klan service, you're transforming his message. He may want his cross to send the message of peace and harmony.   By forcing him to combine it with that expressive event, you force him to send a message of hate and division. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I -- I was a little confused -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " What would the government -- what would the government's position be if you prevail in this case, the baker prevails in this case, and then bakers all over the country received urgent requests: Please do not bake cakes for gay weddings.   And more and more bakers began to comply. Would the government feel vindicated in its position that it now submits to us? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Your Honor, I think in that case, the case for strict scrutiny would be much stronger, because you'd be able to show that your -- that the application of the law is narrowly tailored to the government's interests in ensuring access. Here, of course, you have these products that are widely available from many different sources.   And I would submit, just to finish up, that if you were to disagree with our basic principle, putting aside the line about whether a cake falls on speech or non-speech side of the line, you really are envisioning a situation in which you could force, for example, a gay opera singer to perform at the Westboro Baptist Church just because that opera singer would be willing to perform at the National Cathedral. And the problem is when you force somebody not only to speak but to contribute that speech to an expressive event to which they are deeply opposed, you force them to use their speech to send a message that they fundamentally disagree with.

A corporate photography studio could refuse to take pictures of female CEOs if it believed that a woman's place is in the home. And a florist could put a sign up on her storefront saying we don't do gay funerals, if she objected to memorializing gay people. Now, both Petitioner and the United States recognize that these results are unacceptable with respect to race.

Bob Jones University said we're not discriminating on the basis of race; we allow black people to come into the school.   We just refuse to admit those who are engaged in interracial marriages or advocate interracial dating.   And this Court said that's race discrimination.   That's identity-based discrimination, even if you treat others similarly. But -- but I think one way to think about this case is -- is -- is analogize it to O'Brien, right? In O'Brien, nobody disputed that O'Brien's burning of the draft card to protest the Vietnam War was expressive.   It was core political expression. But what the Court did was it didn't say, well, how expressive is it? Is it artistry; is it not? Is it core; is it not? It said: What is the state trying to do here? Because it's expressive conduct.   And if the state's seeking to regulate conduct, then the fact that it has an incidental effect on Mr. O'Brien's expression is not a problem as long as the state has a content-neutral reason for regulating that conduct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I take Justice Gorsuch's question and substitute for the KKK, a religious group, bizarre perhaps, but a religious group that unfortunately has the same beliefs as the KKK.   It doesn't -- then you can ask your question -- "}, {"speaker": "David D. Cole", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

Piggie Park objected to the message that equal treatment sent.   To serve a -- a black person in a segregated -- previously segregated restaurant sent a tremendous message, a message that Piggie Park sincerely religiously objected to.   And this Court said that that's a frivolous claim in that context. So I don't -- I just -- I don't think you can carve out exceptions to generally applicable rules that regulate conduct in a content-neutral way, as this does.   And so just as Mr. -- the fact that Mr. O'Brien's conduct, burning the draft card, was expressive did not give him a First Amendment exemption to a content-neutral prohibition on draft card destruction, so the fact that Mr. Phillips considers his cake-baking to be expressive doesn't give him a First Amendment exemption to a content-neutral regulation of public accommodation sales in the retail context. This Court has already said that that interest in prohibiting discrimination on the basis of identity in public accommodations is a interest unrelated to the suppression of expression, said that in Roberts versus Jaycees, it serves compelling interests, Roberts versus Jaycees, even where race is not involved.

And -- and when you only have expression, when all that's involved is expression, as was the case with the parade in Hurley, that's different because there's no -- there's no neutral conduct to be regulated. But here what we have is the sale of a good, a cake, to a -- to an individual.   That's -- that -- to the extent it's expressive, it's certainly also conduct.

Cole", "text": " Well, I think under this Court's doctrine in Employment Division versus Smith, the question would be, is it a generally applicable neutral law? And if it's a generally applicable neutral law, there would not be a free exercise question at all.   Right? And so -- and -- and the reason for that, as Justice Scalia said in -- in Employment Division versus Smith, is equally applicable here. Once you open this up, once you say generally applicable regulations of conduct have exceptions when someone raises a religious objection, or in this case have objections where someone raises a speech objection, you're in a world in which every man is a law unto himself. And so the only sensible way to approach this is to say if the state is targeting religion, then we're going to be very careful about protecting religion.   And if the state is targeting the message, is targeting the content of speech, then we're going to be very careful about protecting. But when the state is regulating conduct neutrally, unrelated to expression, which is what this Court has already said is the case with respect to public accommodations, then we can have a world in which everybody who raises an objection -- otherwise we would live in a society in which businesses across this country could put signs up saying we serve whites only, music lessons for Muslims need not apply, passport photos not for the disabled.

Does it -- in your arguments, who controls the expression here, the corporation or its shareholders? I always thought corporations were separate entities.

And Mr. Phillips is also the speaker. So they're both speaking when they're creating -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But who makes a decision for the corporation?

But if we're talking about what the corporation will speak, then the shareholders in an -- in a small family-held corporation, the shareholders would decide that.

He designs most of the wedding cakes himself by him -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's him and his wife, right? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " Yes, it is. I have three brief points in rebuttal: First of all, the bias of the Commission is also evidenced in the unequal treatment of the cake designers, the three other cake designers who were on the squarely opposite sides of this issue. If -- if the Court looks at the analysis that was provided by the Colorado Court of Appeals, line by line they take the opposite approach to Mr. Phillips that they do to those who are unwilling to criticize same-sex marriage -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And they say they wouldn't -- that they would say no to anyone who came with that request? "}, {"speaker": "Kristen Kellie Waggoner", "text": " No.   The Colorado Court of Appeals said that they could have an offensiveness policy, and they said that those three cake designers were expressing their own message if they had to design that cake. In Mr. Phillips's case, they said it wasn't his message.   It's simply compliance with the law. In the other case, they said that the cake designers, because they served Christian customers in other contexts, that that was evidence it was a distinction based on the message, but in Mr. Phillips's case, they ruled the opposite way. Professor Laycock's brief provides a good analysis of that as well.   It was filed in this case. Second, the Compelled Speech Doctrine and the Free Exercise Clause is anchored in the concept of dignity and speaker autonomy.   And in this case, dignity cuts both ways.   The record is clear on that. Demeaning Mr. Phillips's honorable and decent religious beliefs about marriage, when he has served everyone and has a history of declining all kinds of cakes unaffiliated with sexual orientation because of the message, he should receive protection here as well. This law protects the lesbian graphic designer who doesn't want to design for the Westboro Baptist Church, as much as it protects Mr. Phillips. Lastly, political, religious, and moral opinions shift.   We know that.   And this Court's dedication to Compelled Speech Doctrine and to free exercise should not shift.
