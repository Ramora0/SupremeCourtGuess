That's correct, yes? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F.

So what does that mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson?   Because the United States is the United States.   It's made up of 50 States.

It wanted to sell its product anywhere that the distributor could find.   The distributor was the market manager. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right, anywhere.

This is not general jurisdiction.   This is specific jurisdiction.   So the question is, when you target the entire United States and each of the 50 States within that and an accident occurs within one of those States, are you subject to jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a claim based on that accident?   Not generally, but just for a claim based on that accident.   Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said as long as there's purposeful availment, there is specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment when there's an active effort to target a market. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Well, Your Honor, in Burger King, in Hanson, in World-Wide Volkswagen, the purposeful availment is defined as conducting activities within the forum State.   The -- this Court, through those opinions, foreseeability, clear notice, reasonably anticipate -- all converge.

Your proposition is that a company can deliberately send its products, wants to explore the U.S. market.   But I take it that there is no place in the United States, because New Jersey is no different than California or any other place -- is it your position that there is no forum in which McIntyre can be sued, even though it set up this distribution arrangement for the very purpose of having its machines in as many locations in the United States as it could?   Is there a forum in the United States where it could be sued? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Which one?

Now, does that make a whole lot of sense?   Is it any more convenient for McIntyre to come to Ohio than New Jersey?   It's a lot less convenient for Mr. Nicastro, who had his fingers removed by this machine.   But you are conceding that there is a forum where this British company can be sued on a tort that occurred in New Jersey.   Explain to me why, since there is a forum in the United States, the logical one isn't New Jersey rather than Ohio. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Well, Your Honor, first, the issue of convenience, choice of law, conflict of law, as a determinative factor was rejected by this Court. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I'm asking you the question: Where can it be sued?   Well, something happened in New Jersey.   The machine, allegedly defective machine, caused a harm there.   What happened in Ohio?   What basis for specific jurisdiction is there in Ohio?   There was no tort in Ohio. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Well, Your Honor, under Ohio law, the -- there can be an assignment.   There was no written contract between MMA and J. McIntyre.   There can be an assignment in return for a release of a common law indemnification right. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I don't understand. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Fergenson, just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim between the British manufacturer and its distributor in Ohio.   Any kind of contract claim, a claim based on the agreement between the two, Ohio is the appropriate place for jurisdiction.   But Ohio does not seem the appropriate place for jurisdiction -- and again, we're talking about specific jurisdiction, not general -- as to a claim based on an accident that occurred in New Jersey.   The entire idea of specific jurisdiction is that you need a relationship between the defendant and the forum and the claim, and here the claim arose in New Jersey and was in fact not related to Ohio. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Well, Your Honor, Ohio explicitly provides, and they are -- it's arisen in statute of limitation cases, and it goes back to Travelers Indemnity v. Trowbridge, that an action under both express and common law indemnity arises under contract.   So upon the assignment, and there need not be a judgment under Ohio law -- that's Fort Defiance Construction v. Village of Grover Hill -- there can be an assignment of a common law indemnity under strict product liability. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What kind of common law indemnity are we dealing with here?   Where does Mr. Nicastro sue?   He hasn't got any assignment, any indemnity.   Mr. Nicastro is injured in the United States by a machine manufactured in England and he wants to sue, understandably, in the United States.   Why are we talking about assignments, indemnity?   That has nothing to do with Mr. Nicastro. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, it does.   Mr. Nicastro had an action under strict product liability.   I want to come back to more fully answer the why question that you asked: Why is it just and right that he go to Ohio? "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " No, I would just like to know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and not in New Jersey.   In New Jersey, it's the place where the accident occurred, and in Ohio there's nothing but the relationship between the distributor -- there's a contract between the distributor and McIntyre.   So why does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Ohio has New Jersey -- jurisdiction.   As Your Honor noticed, there are three places that Mr. Nicastro, in looking over this, could have chosen: United Kingdom, which he is now in, in filing a claim in the liquidation proceedings; Ohio; and New Jersey.   The accident occurred in New Jersey.   That's a forum non conveniens issue that's-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It's a forum what? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --That's a convenience issue, a forum non conveniens.   And justice Brennan was clear before Burger King that that's what he wanted to see the law go in the direction of.   He was clear about that.   Ohio, however, in looking at International Shoe, going back to International Shoe, which talks about the relationship between the defendant and the forum State-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And the claim in suit.   That's very important. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --And -- and the cause of action, yes.   There -- the one place where both the distributor, who would upon suit and then a claim over under product, strict product liability would disappear -- that's why you can get an assignment -- the distributor is in Ohio, and so too is the contract relationship. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I still don't follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment, indemnity.   Mr. Nicastro has a claim against -- well, he sued them both, but the distributor is now bankrupt.   And he says, well, this is specific jurisdiction; specific jurisdiction, as International Shoe teaches, is where the claim arose.   International Shoe, it arose in the State of Washington because that's where the shoe -- the people who were promoting sale of International Shoe's -- International Shoe's shoes worked every day.   So it was a claim relating to a tax owed by International Shoe based on the events that occurred in California.   It was not all-purpose jurisdiction.   And your suggestion that Ohio somehow is a proper forum for Mr. Nicastro's tort claim, I really don't follow that. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " It -- Your Honor, it is.   Mr. Nicastro could have contacted MMA and stated: I have a strict product liability action -- or the trustee in bankruptcy.   The statute of limitations was 2 years in both cases.   Ohio would have applied New Jersey strict liability law. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Your answer to Justice Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you, but it seems to me all of a sudden you're talking about how Ohio law will help you out.   I thought the question was, from the standpoint of the defendant at least, whether the defendant purposely availed itself of the forum and you would say the defendant here purposely availed itself of Ohio by choosing an Ohio distributor.   But you don't make that argument.   You're talking about a contract, an indemnity, which seems to me another step.   That's a choice of law and applicable law. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " I agree, Your Honor; it is choice of law. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --Also, I don't think it's worth your time, because frankly it doesn't make a whole lot of difference to me whether they can sue in Ohio or not.   You really think that that's-- "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " And, Your Honor-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --What about in the United States?   Would the United States have jurisdiction? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --No, because-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " The United States would not?   They surely targeted the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, in the -- in Justice O'Connor's footnote on national contacts in Asahi, which was not disputed and I think essentially accepted by Justice Brennan, in that footnote it states that national contacts is for the national sovereign to decide. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " That's right.   But if the national sovereign, the United States, provided by statute that Federal district courts would have jurisdiction over any, any tort suit by a person injured by a foreign manufacturer that targeted the United States, would that be proper?

It may be that Congress-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Of course.   It's a hypothetical. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.

"}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Would you say the same thing if, hypothetically, since we're engaging in a hypothetical, the distributor were in France, machine manufactured in England, distributor is in France, and the distributor then selects the United States and then the same facts, New Jersey?   United States would be an appropriate jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, but not New Jersey? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " I think that, with that one step-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Assuming the statute that Justice Scalia hypothesizes. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor.   I think that, with that one step beyond-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It's a little odd that the States, which have residual sovereignty, which are not limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here, does have jurisdiction.   That seems backwards. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, I think that if one looks at this as part of the Congress's power to control, let's say, imports, then as a condition -- and this is what the proposed Foreign Manufacturer's Legal Accountability Act-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, Congress has power to control the jurisdiction of Federal courts, and Congress says Federal courts have jurisdiction over this matter. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Fergenson, could I try another hypothetical? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But the question is why the State can't make the same choice that the Congress does.   The State lacks foreign affairs power, to be sure.   Is that the only distinction?   That doesn't sound to me like due process.   What we're talking about is a source of authority, not fairness to the defendant. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think -- and I go to two words in particular in Burger King, one taken from Hanson, which is essential -- it is essential in each case that there be a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum; and then the other-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Mr. Fergenson, the question is whether seeking to serve a market -- and here you're seeking to serve a market in each of the 50 States -- is purposeful availment.   So let me just try a different hypothetical.   Suppose you had the same arrangement with your distributor in Ohio, but the arrangement was not to serve the entire United States market.   Instead, the arrangement was to serve only five States in the Midwest.   That's what you wanted, your client wanted, the market to be.   So it was going to be Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Michigan and Iowa, all right?   So now a machine blows up in Illinois.   Is there jurisdiction in Illinois? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " There is jurisdiction in Illinois, even though your relationship with your distributor was in Ohio.   But there's jurisdiction in Illinois because the machine blew up there and you were seeking to serve the market; that's right? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Because there was a direction of the distributor to go into the State where the accident occurred. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   Now we have -- now we say this is working very well.   Let's get another nine distributors on board.   We'll give each of them five states, all right?   Now, if I understand you correctly, now you're liable all over the United States because you've had this relationship with ten different distributors, each of whom are going to serve five states.   So there's personal jurisdiction in any state where a machine blows up. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " If the -- yes, Your Honor, if the states are assigned by name. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And now I say: Let's forget these ten distributors.   Who needs ten distributors?   I'll just have one distributor.   Why is there any difference? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " Because that distributor -- unless that distributor is told, you must go, like a traveling salesperson, you must go into each State, you must personally go into each State -- that's purposeful availment. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Fergenson, with respect, this distributor was told to sell as many products as it could in as many States as it could. "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F. Fergenson", "text": " No, it was not, Your Honor.   It was not told to do anything more than to sell products, not in as many-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Excuse me, counselor.   Going back to the relationship, Justice Scalia asked you whether there was legal control, and you said no.   But there was coordination, wasn't there?   Isn't -- doesn't the record show that the English company traveled to the trade shows with the American company?   Wasn't your president, your English president, present at the Las Vegas show in which this New Jersey company first saw the machine?   Is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Arthur F.

That letter also states that: We've spent $350,000 and we performed the -- we performed repairs and warranty service without seeking reimbursement from you, and that's consistent with the distant relationship here.   Your Honor, we asked for the names of the customers.   We didn't get it.   We didn't get -- we didn't drop-ship.

Great.   Okay?   That's it.   Now, suppose that the law were, as it could be perhaps, that it is sufficient for jurisdiction throughout the United States that the distributor or independent buyer said: Good, I'm selling them everywhere I can and two or three end up in New Mexico, but it doesn't matter where they end up.

I can see it going forward in -- in Japan, but it has no connection with the United States.

There's been a recent decision by Judge Chasanow on melamine in which Chasanow applied the availability law that this Court has set forth in Piper and Gulf Oil and -- and the other cases that follow, and determined that China was an available forum for the plaintiffs suing for the harm to their children from tainted milk.

One thing that happened, we have to take it as, I think, an independent company, whether you want to call them a distributor or not.   I didn't see a difference there.   An independent company goes to a firm somewhere in the world and says: I will buy your product and sell it in the United States.   And the guy says good.   And that's true whether it's a woman's cooperative in southern India or whether it's the biggest company in the world, okay?   That's the first thing.   The second thing is that an executive of that company went to seven trade shows in the United States.   And the third thing is that two, three, or four machines ended up in New Jersey.

We have a lot of small businesses.   And I would worry -- now, maybe the worry is legally irrelevant -- but I'd worry about a rule of law that subjects every small business in every developing company -- in every developing country to have to be aware of the law in 50 States simply because they agreed to sell to an independent company who is going to sell to America, plus your two factors.

I believe that that is outside of this -- taken out of this case by an admission in the brief -- at least for this sale -- in the brief in our position to defendant's motion to dismiss at 1920 filed October 11th, 2006, where they state, where respondent states it was sold by us to MMA, and it was sold by MMA to Curcio Scrap Metal.   So, there is no consignment, there is no consignment under 9102 which Ohio has adopted. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It is a different question than I asked.

Let me say that for the -- there was no interaction in the record with anyone from New Jersey by MMA or by J. McIntyre.   It was the booth, and then there was an order.   And if you look at the invoice, it says verbal order.   There was an order by the son of the owner of Curcio metal works, and that's it.   The order was fulfilled.
