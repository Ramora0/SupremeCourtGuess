It did this even though the State had done three things that should have precluded this result: First, the State deliberately relinquished a known statute of limitations defense.   Second, in doing so the State acted strategically, not inadvertently.   And third, in doing so the State induced the district court to expend substantial resources in deciding claims of exhaustion and deciding claims on the merits.

I thought we took this case to decide the more significant issue, on which there is a division in the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say, power of the court to disregard the fact that the statute of limitations defense has not been raised.

The court itself raised Day and raised its limited authority under Day to consider a statute of limitations defense.   They found, rather than a deliberate waiver, which I believe the record supports, that the State's comments were cryptic, and I will stress-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Once the court found there was a deliberate waiver, I definitely challenged that finding.   I -- there is a very strong argument not included within the -- the questions presented, that this is a totally timely petition.   And it's only, it's a very difficult argument.   Which is one of the reasons why it shows how much the State's actions in the district court were strategic. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, you had two opportunities at least to make the argument based on the original post-conviction motion, the 1995 post-conviction motion.   You did not raise that.   You were silent twice. "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " Silent on the impact of the 19 -- we were not silent on the impact of the 1995 motion.   We've always said, and in fact the State has never disputed, that that was a properly filed motion, and the only issue was whether it was tolled -- whether it tolled the statute of limitations period until 2004.   And the State realized that that issue -- if they were to prevail on the timeliness issue, it was a very, very difficult issue. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well then, I'm confused because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that the question was asked did you file another post-conviction motion; answer: No. "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " I understand your question now.   When Mr. Wood was pro se, he filled out pro se motions, and in those pro se motions he did say that there -- and I'm talking about the 2004 motions -- he said there was no prior post-conviction motion.   And I believe he was confused because if you look at the forms, both the Federal forms and the State forms that show what a -- a defendant should check, it makes it sound like a motion has to have been ruled on; and Mr. Wood was pro se and simply confused.   And no one else was confused once the State entered their appearance.   They knew that the 1995 motion was still pending.   All they had to do was sit at a computer and bring up the minute orders from the State, and they could learn that.   So the courts in making their rulings always from the time -- and, you know, one of the reasons why what happened was so strategic, and so clear, is that the district court had initially dismissed Mr. Wood's petition as untimely.   And-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Ms. Lord, could I ask you about the first question presented? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " --Uh-hmm. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " As I understand the opposing argument, it goes sort of like this.   It says: In Day we said it's fine to do this in the district court; even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise it on this exact issue.   In Granberry we said with respect to a different issue that the appellate court could raise it; and in Day we said that those two issues were really the same.   So that seems sort of like a logical argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on the first question, unless perhaps there is a difference between a court raising a question sua sponte and a court allowing a party to raise it later than the party ought to have raised it.   Are you relying on that distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " Both.   And with respect to the first argument about there being a difference between a party presenting an issue and a court sua sponte raising the issue, there is a difference.   And the courts, the circuit courts do not always make that distinction and do not always focus on that.   For example in Granberry it actually was a case where the party presented -- the State presented on appeal the exhaustion issue, and the court agreed to hear it even though the State hadn't raised it below.   Here, you know, at least five times in our joint appendix you'll see the court saying that they can't act as an advocate for the Petitioner.   And in fact when the Petitioner, Mr. Wood, tried to raise an -- the exhaustion issue again, the Tenth Circuit in its certificate of appealability said he is bound by his decision to dismiss these unexhausted claims, notwithstanding his pro se status.   And in the same breath, the court of appeals resurrected the at least concededly forfeited statute of limitations defense on behalf of the State.   But I'd also like to-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm a little confused.   You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a party raising it first.   Is that your position?   That that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they didn't assert below?   Now the court of appeals has more power? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " --It raises different concerns.   My concern is not the relative power.   It's that when a court is raising something sua sponte it defeats the party presentation principle.   That's one concern.   When the court is -- when the party raises it after having forfeited, everyone concedes here that they wouldn't be allowed to.   So in essence what happens is the court is acting as a super advocate for-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But those arguments were rejected in Granberry and Day. "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " --Well, that-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Why should they win now? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " --Well, and that was -- I was going to -- I had a second part of my answer to Justice Kagan, which is there is something really different going on in Granberry and in Day, and you can't add the two and come up with a neat package such as what's suggested by the State.   And in Granberry, of course, as the Court all knows, the Court was dealing with exhaustion, and it was dealing with exhaustion, which goes to the heart of habeas and comity and all those concerns, at a time when dismissing a case to exhaust claims, all that would do is delay Federal relief.   It wouldn't eliminate Federal relief.   And this Court in Rhines v. Weber recognizes that when AEDPA -- AEDPA was passed, it transformed the landscape, and it really made some changes.   And whether the -- the notion in Granberry that exhaustion can be raised for the first time on appeal transfers to the statute of limitations, I think there is real doubt about that, and I think that goes to an important question, and the question that the Court granted cert on. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But didn't Day say that those two issues were functionally identical for this purpose? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " Not for this purpose.   And by \"this purpose\" I mean the court of appeals' authority to raise sua sponte the defense.   In Day, this Court -- there were two prongs to Day.   In the context of Day.   Which was, you know, where the State had filed a Rule 5 response and patently erroneously calculated the -- the limitations period, and the court noticed it and there is no law that required, as this Court held, the court to muzzle itself and not mention you've miscalculated these days.   We are in a totally different situation.   And the Rules of Civil Procedure allowed what happened in Day.   They don't allow what happened in our case.   And-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What Rule of Civil Procedure applies here?   You're talking about appellate procedure here.   Is there a rule of appellate procedure that governs this? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " --I'm referring to Civil Rule of Procedure 8(b) and 12. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, they refer to what happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that.   Now you're in the court of appeals.   What rule is there that addresses the situation in the court of appeals? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " Well, there is the traditional rule that if you don't raise it you lose it, when we are talking about a statute of limitations defense.   And it's really key here, because when AEDPA engrafted this 1-year statute of limitations into the habeas proceedings it knew how 1-year statute of limitations were treated.   And yes, in Day, quite correctly the Court held that in that context you're going to treat those defenses the same, especially with respect to Rule 4, which would allow a court to dismiss a petition just on its face. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You made an argument in your brief that I found it a little difficult to follow, so maybe you can explain it.   You seemed to suggest that the State's position on timeliness in district court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims that were arguably not exhausted.   And I found it difficult to understand why the -- why your client's strategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims are not -- would be affected by the State's position on timeliness. "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " Well, if the State had challenged timeliness at the stage that AEDPA contemplates it would, it would have created a real complicated issue on abandonment, and I think the briefs suggest just how complicated that is under Colorado law.   And if that had happened, the court very well could have, district court, could have appointed counsel for Mr. Wood -- I mean, if there had been an evidentiary hearing, if, as the Tenth Circuit found, the issue was so complex that counsel was necessary.   So once you had counsel, in the State's reply or in its answer they indicated that several of Mr. Wood's claims were not exhausted, and some of those claims were in that 1995 motion that was pending.   With counsel, there could have been a request for \"a stay and abey\".   There could have been so much that was done.   Mr. -- but because the State chose to simplify the proceedings, that's what they did, and it was not inadvertent; it wasn't a mistake.   They chose to make it simple and to focus on exhaustion, so they got four claims dismissed on exhaustion grounds, and then they dealt with the other two claims on the merits.   They also had a procedural default issue which was totally unconstitutional.   They were relying on a procedural default that didn't exist at the time you had to raise it.   But that simplified the proceedings, made it more a question of the law.   Mr.-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what's wrong with that?   Why should we be penalizing the State for trying to simplify an action, and make it move more expeditiously? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " --Absolutely we should not.   But we also should hold them to that strategic choice, which is what Day says you do, and we have to hold them to that choice because there were consequences and there were changes of positions.   And they got the benefit of going forward and just looking at exhaustion.   They eliminated the risk of an evidentiary hearing.   They eliminated the risk of a lawyer.   They induced Mr. -- they induced Mr. Wood to dismiss four claims because -- oh, sorry.   Because -- I'm sorry.   I didn't see you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, no.   Keep going. "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " No -- because he was assured that he could go forward on two substantial constitutional claims without worrying about time bar, because the State said that.   They said twice: We are not challenging, we will not challenge timeliness. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " That's what I don't understand.   Why -- you have two situations.   One situation, the State's raising timeliness.   So he says: Okay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to dismiss my -- the claims that they say are not exhausted.   The other situation, they -- they don't say anything about timeliness, and he says: Now I'm going to dismiss the claims that are -- that they say are unexhausted.   I don't understand the connection. "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " Well, the connection is, the State guaranteed that they would not challenge timeliness.   And that allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two constitutional claims without ever having to worry that they would be subject to time bar.   And when the Court-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I understand why that's a benefit to him.   But what is the connection between that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims? "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " --Oh.   Because if they had -- if they had challenged timeliness, they would have raised this very complicated issue, because the only way they can win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled notion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under Colorado law requires a hearing and requires factual development.   And once they pursued in the district court that claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a lawyer would be appointed.   That lawyer could see that there were claims still pending in the 1995 motion, and could possibly have sought a stay and abey; could have gone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious constitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion.   And maybe a better way of putting it is if they had raised timeliness in the district court, abandonment would have been front and center.   And even though the court of appeals ultimately resolved this issue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse of discretion itself, too.   It was totally contrary to Colorado law, analyzing that issue.   It is no small thing that the position that they took in the district court allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two claims, two constitutional claims that are substantial that the Court has granted a certificate of appealability on.   This is -- this case is so unlike Day, in the sense -- if an appellate court can raise sua sponte the statute of limitations in a case like this, it can raise it in any case.   It invites the State to take a position in the district court which would be totally contrary to AEDPA's desire for streamlined proceedings. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Ms. Lord, an amicus brief filed on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil -- Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be consulted here, because they govern only to the extent that they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and asserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply, and that they -- that they cut against your case.   Do you have a response to that?   Was it -- was it in your reply brief or-- "}, {"speaker": "Kathleen A. Lord", "text": " It may be.   I believe in some of the briefs what I've said is there is no inconsistency between Rule 5's requirement that the defense be set forth and the traditional recognition that statute of limitations is lost if not raised.   And I cited the Court to Jones v. Bock, which stresses that for mere policy reasons we shouldn't deviate from the rules that would otherwise apply.   And I think-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Isn't the screening function that the -- the district court performs in the habeas case inconsistent with the traditional rule about raising affirmative defenses?

The appellate court can issue a certificate of appealability.   The district court has that prescreening function, which is just like the prescreening function in the PLRA, where this Court looked at a circuit's attempt to create rules that would address policy concerns and deviated and put an enhanced pleading requirement on prisoners, and said -- I believe unanimously -- unanimously, that that shouldn't be done.   There's a real virtue in having a predictable rule.   There's a real virtue in letting the States or -- letting the States know in the context of this Court's Federal timing rules that they have to raise it, the statute of limitations defense, when they are ordered to and when Rule 5 requires them to.   You should not adopt the State's position when it will just invite the sort of sandbagging that this Court has taken care to avoid.

She's saying that makes a lot of sense.   When you read Day, they're worried about the State doing something inadvertently, making a mistake.

It takes up the two unexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits.   In Day, absolutely nothing transpired between the State saying the claim was timely and the magistrate's detection of the computation error.   The district court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work.   It was the consequence of saying we will challenge it, force the district judge to deal with it on the merits.   In Day, the counsel didn't bring up the question because counsel thought that it was timely.   He had miscalculated and made a mathematical error.   And the judge then said: I see that the number of days that's required by statute, they have run.   And as Day pointed out, at that point a trial judge could have said: Now, you know you miscalculated; wouldn't you like to amend your complaint and put in a defense.

So it was certainly ex ante quite possible that the response of the district court would not be to simply ignore the issue as it did but to either ask for additional briefing, as happens with some regularity, to issue a show-cause order as it had already done, or perhaps to dismiss the case again as it had already done so.

That's the only rule we are asking for today.   And the contrary rule really provides some perverse incentives to states.   I mean, here the State was trying to be candid with the Court.   It discovered this 1995 motion on its own.   Mr. Wood had never mentioned it in his filings.   He had already briefed the timeliness issue twice in the district court without mentioning it, let alone raising it at any of his petitions.   The State found this and tried to be candid, that we weren't entirely clear about how the argument played out, the alternative is that states will be forced into something more than scorched earth, throw everything at the Court, see what sticks, and that's not in anybody's interest, let alone the Federal court's or habeas petitioners.

Here in Day, the, the lawyer did not know that he had a statute of limitations defense, that -- did not know it was miscalculated at the time.   Here the State knew very well that it did have a statute of limitations argument, but it says: We are not challenging it.   And then the ordinary thing is that a court of appeals reviews decisions of the district court; doesn't decide questions in the first instance.   But here you are saying the attorney can tell district judge: Don't decide; just go on to the merits.   Then the court of appeals, which is supposed to be reviewing what the district court does, instead deals with that question in the first instance.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Ms. Sherry, there is one difference, is you put Granberry and Day together, ti gets you most of the way there.   The one difference is that here there was sua sponte decision by the Court; whereas, in even the combination of Granberry and Day, it was a party that raised it, although the party raised it late.   So why should that difference not matter?   If you think that party presentation has some consequence in this area, you might think that that difference does matter; that once you get to the court of appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it, sort of enough is enough.

Number one, I think it's significant that Day itself was a case in which the Court raised it, raised it on its-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But at the time trial level-- "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --At the trial level-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --Of course, the habeas court has a significant screening function. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --No, that's certainly true.   I think the procedural default cases are another good example this Court in Day cited, a number of them, a number of them of which were cases in which the court of appeals was raising the issue sua sponte.   On page 12 of our brief, we cite a number of procedural default cases.   A lot of them come up in the sua sponte context.   And the courts of appeals have not made a distinction between the two.   I think they certainly implicate different concerns.   For example, to the extent this Court has been worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I think that's largely absent in circumstances where the Court is raising on its own motions as opposed to the party belatedly raising the issue on appeal.   So I do think if you look at Granberry, you look at Day, you look at Gaspari, you look at Schiro, and you look at the procedural default cases, I think that really does resolve the first question presented.   And again, I don't think the Petitioner argues otherwise at this point. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I may have forgotten the procedural complications of this case, but here, did the State have any opportunity before the court of appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time when the court of appeals issued its certificate of appealability?   And if the court of appeals had not issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of timeliness, would the issue have come up at all? "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " The State did have an opportunity in the court of appeals because after the application for a certificate of appealability was filed, the court did order the State to file a response, and the State didn't argue timeliness in that response.   But when the court of appeals did ask for briefing on this issue in the certificate of appealability process, the State, of course, did have an opportunity to respond there, and it did argue that the petition was untimely, and it strongly argued that.   And so, I guess, turning to the second question presented of deliberate waiver, I don't think there has been a deliberate waiver in the way that Day spoke about that term here for two primary reasons.   Number one when Day spoke of deliberate waiver, it spoke of overriding a State's deliberate waiver, and I think if you look, when the court of appeals decided the timeliness question, there is no way to look at that as the State -- as the court, rather actually overriding the State's deliberate waiver.   At that point the State had argued that the petition was untimely.   Petitioner never argued that the court shouldn't decide the issue, never argued that that -- that the State had waived that issue below.   And I think at that time it's really difficult to characterize that as overriding the State's deliberate waiver.   The other point I would make is in the district court-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But the difference is that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of limitations defense.   So the court suggested it.   In this case the defendant -- I mean, the -- the attorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a statute of limitations defense and nevertheless told the court we won't challenge timeliness.   There is a big difference between, if that's the background of Day where the lawyer didn't know there was a statute of limitations defense; and this one was the lawyer knew very well there was and decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal with that issue. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --I -- I think that certainly is true, but I think it's important in deciding whether or not this should be treated as a deliberate waiver to look at what the consequences of treating it as such would be.   The consequences of treating it as a deliberate waiver under the language Day is that the court's hands would be bound; the court would be unable to decide the timeliness question.   And it's not just the court of appeals; the district court as well.   So if this were a clear deliberate waiver in district court when the State filed its preanswer response, the district court would have been without any authority to consider-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So why is that -- why is that a bad result?   The -- I -- imagine the facts are these.   The State forgets to waive the issue, to raise the issue in its defense, all right?   Forgets.   Judge:   \"State you haven't raised a statute of limitations. \"   State: One possible answer.   \"Thank you, Your Honor. \"   \"We overlooked our forfeiture, we want to raise it. \"   That's one.   Number two: They say, \"we don't care\".   Number three: \"We don't want to\".   Okay? "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now in two and three, you can say this; you could say the reason that we depart from the normal rule that you have to actually assert it in your defense is we are trying to protect the State -- because of habeas.   So we protect the State at least by giving them a chance to make the argument when they forget or some other reasons.   Now we gave them a chance.   Now they say huh -- who cares?   All right, if that's their attitude, why is it the habeas court's business to protect the State from themselves? "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " --Because it's not just about the State.   Because it's -- because of the institutional interests that are at stake.

Breyer", "text": " And-- "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " And -- and that's the very question here, whether it should be treated like forfeiture or whether it would be treated like waiver.   And the reason why I think it would be a bad result to treat it as waiver here and why it would be bad to have bound the district court's hands in this case, if you look at what happened here, the district court on its own motion initially dismissed this as untimely.   It came back and it went to the State and said, you know, I need more information.   And the State provided that additional information.   It would be a somewhat odd system for when the district court now had this information in front of it, now knew about the 1995 motion, for it not to have been able to do anything further with respect to timeliness on -- on that point.   The fact that the State for whatever reason decided to press other issues shouldn't bind the district court's hands except in the rarest of circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But we have a system where the court doesn't raise issue on its own.   The ordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the party says to the court we will not challenge timeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different thing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the defense.   It's affirmatively representing to the court that we -- we are not making this an issue. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " And -- and to be clear, I think that's certainly a factor that the courts can and do consider in deciding whether to exercise their discretion to consider a timeliness issue.   The question here is whether or not the court should lose any discretion to consider that issue. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The Court did say that if -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense, then no court can bring it up.   The party has made its choice. "}, {"speaker": "Melissa Arbus Sherry", "text": " That's -- that's what the Court said in Day.   And I guess the question is -- is how strictly that should be construed.   And our position would be that it should be strictly construed because of the consequences of that waiver.   And again, I think it's significant that the Court in Day did talk about overriding a State's deliberate waiver.   In the dissent, Justice Scalia, you mentioned the example of a court amending a party's pleading over that party's objections.   And I think that really is the narrow circumstance in which the waiver rule should operate.   It's not that the State's behavior is irrelevant to the question before the Court as to whether the Court should exercise its discretion; it's actually quite relevant, and it's something that courts of appeals can and do look at.   The question is whether or not the courts lack any authority to consider a limitations defense or other procedural defense-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And I think there are a limited number of circumstances where -- where that makes sense, and I think the Court has seen examples of that as recently as this term, for example.   The Court denied cert in the case Buck v. Thaler earlier this term, where a predecessor case that is an example of the State expressly waiving a procedural default defense because it wanted the Court to reach the merits.   In that case, the State said quite plainly -- in the predecessor case, I should say -- the State said quite plainly because the use of race in the punishment phase seriously undermined the fairness and integrity of the judicial process, the director expressly waives any procedural bar with respect to that claim.   Now, that is the quintessential deliberate waiver.   And it took it off table, unlike what happened in this case. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.
