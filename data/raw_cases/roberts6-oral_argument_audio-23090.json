Panner", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Article III requires a private plaintiff to show injury in fact, which means at a minimum that the alleged illegal conduct made her worse off.   Factual injury does not automatically follow from violation of a statutory duty owed to the plaintiff, and Ms. Edwards has not alleged the type of harm alleged by plaintiffs in the common law cases that she invokes -- no misappropriation of her property, no loss of desired opportunity or benefit, no injury to reputation.

Breyer", "text": " Let me just get -- use an example, a hypothetical based on the next case, really: I was thinking Congress passes a law, says you can't phone people between 7:00 at night and 7:00 in the morning and try to sell them something, okay?   That's the law.   And anyone who gets such a phone call gets $500 in damages automatically if they sue in court if they receive such a call.   The harm was getting the call.   So my grandmother, who is always complaining no one ever calls her, loved the telephone call.   She loved it.   The best thing happened to her in a month, okay?   Now, can she sue? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " No, Your Honor.   If she does not have actual injury, the fact of the statutory violation would not give rise to standing in that case.   Now, it's -- I think it would be quite unlikely that a plaintiff would come before the Court and say: Actually the statutory violation delighted me; I nevertheless would like my $500.   But if the injury-in-fact requirement means anything, it means that a plaintiff who comes before the Court must have a harm in fact. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

So Congress is acting on the potential that these kind of kickbacks can cause harm.   And this does seem to fit the bill of restitution, unjust enrichment cases, where the plaintiff doesn't have to prove any harm, she just gets back what the defendant should not have received. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --Your Honor, with respect to unjust enrichment cases, those cases reflect circumstances where there is a benefit received at the expense of the plaintiff.   And in -- in the traditional sorts of cases -- unjust enrichment, of course, is an invention as a category that is relatively recent.   But unjust enrichment cases reflect quasi-contract circumstances, where a benefit was conferred, that injustice should have been compensated, so the plaintiff is made worse off in not receiving the benefit or the compensation for the benefit; or a circumstance of constructive trust, where there was property or other right of the plaintiff that was misappropriated and used without the permission of the plaintiff.   So an opportunity or a property was taken away.   This is not a case like that, and there is no allegation that there is anything lacking in the insurance that was issued.   This is a circumstance in which Congress may believe that a certain practice as a general matter can tend to bring out -- bring about bad -- bad outcomes and can therefore make it unlawful.   But the question here is whether this plaintiff has a harm-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Counsel, are you taking a very broad position that this is an unusual State, it appears, with three or four others, where the States mandate that title insurance be at a fixed price.

Is that the position you are taking? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --No, Your Honor.

Panner", "text": " I don't think so, Your Honor, because again the question for purposes of standing, the question for purposes of the ability of a plaintiff to come into court, is to show that they have some injury in fact, that there is some harm, some way in which they were made worse off.   This plaintiff-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " That's not so extraordinary.   It is what has to be shown in -- in Sherman Act cases, right?

What the case says is that a -- that a beneficiary can come into court and say: The trust has violated the duty to me; I want to unwind the transaction to get the benefit that I would have gotten had the trustee behaved in the way required.   So in those cases involving trustees, for example, they-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " There is not automatic disgorgement in those-- "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M.

But again that reflects the lost value of what was paid for in terms of the -- of the-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, but-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Panner, I thought-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --let -- let's assume that a trustee acts on its own interest and -- and sells property.   But let's assume that he gets top dollar for that property, so that the beneficiary hasn't really been deprived of anything.   What is the injury to the beneficiary? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --Well, the injury to the beneficiary in that circumstance, Your Honor, is that the trustee would have misappropriated an opportunity that belonged to the beneficiary.   In the cases that are -- in the ordinary case, then, the beneficiary has the option to say, I would like to unwind that or get the benefit that the trustee got, if there was self-dealing.   But in a circumstance where a trustee sells, for example, a piece of property and the -- and the claim is one for restitution to try to unwind the transaction that was done, it's the option of the beneficiary to say: You know what, maybe I am wrong but I think I would be better off if I could undo that transaction.   So it's a very conventional kind of harm where someone believes that their property was -- was taken away from them and used in a way to their detriment, and they are therefore seeking relief. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what more does this plaintiff have to allege other than, if I had been told that this was a prearranged, tied product between the mortgage and the title company, but that I had a right to get an untied product even at the same price, and I would have exercised that right if I had known -- would that be enough? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " That might be enough, Your Honor.   But that's exactly what she didn't allege.

Panner", "text": " Yes, I think that certainly would be enough, absolutely.   The -- the point is that this complaint abstracted away any such particularized claim for a very particular purpose, which was that in order to maintain this case as a class action the basis of harm could not be anything personal or individual to this plaintiff. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you go back to your position that Congress has no power to give a cause of action on the basis of a statutory violation in which it is presuming injury? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " That is correct, Your Honor.   The -- what Congress cannot do is to confer on a particular plaintiff an injury that is constitutionally sufficient under Article III.   I think this Court has made clear that Congress cannot do that and that the existence of a statutory right by itself, even the invasion, the violation of the statutory right does not create injury for constitutional purposes.   Injury-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, certainly you couldn't -- you couldn't sue.   But if I paid money that I would have -- and that I'm entitled to get back, then I have been injured, because-- "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, you paid money -- in this case the plaintiff paid money for a title insurance policy which she received.   She paid at -- at the legally required rate, and she makes no complaint about the policy, nor does she claim that it would have mattered to her-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could I ask you to clarify something?   What could a plaintiff who purchases title insurance in Ohio allege that would be sufficient to provide standing?

Panner", "text": " --that there was something about the service that she received as a result of the -- the referral to a particular title insurer, again, assuming that this is a violation, which we don't -- we don't think it is.   But -- but assuming that it is, that-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So you could -- the plaintiff could allege some kind defective service at the time when the title insurance was purchased?   There really is no service provided at that time, is there? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --Actually, most-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You get a title insurance policy and that's it; and you don't know whether -- you don't know what will happen if there is some problem alleged with the title at some point down the road. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --Well, that's really -- the -- the risk of that is really on the title insurer, which is why the title insurer has no incentive whatsoever to encourage poor service by a title insurance agent. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " --Well, that -- that leads me to this point.   I thought -- I never thought of title insurance companies as being fungible, and some were very, very good about narrowing the exceptions, about working with the seller of the property, if you represented the buyer, to get rid of the exceptions.   And so I'm not sure that it's just a question of a policy versus no policy.   There's a -- there's a quality to the -- to the research they do.   And the next -- and related to that is this: you -- you put the case as if the price is going to be the same for the insurance.   A, I think there is nothing in the -- in the State law that permits the insurance company to get -- to set a lower rate; and second, don't the title companies charge other fees, title search fees and so forth, other fees in addition to the price of the insurance?   And those other fees, arguably -- I know she didn't allege any damage -- but those other fees arguably are too high because of this fixed market. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Well, Your Honor, that-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Now, she didn't allege that.   I know that. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --She didn't allege it, and I think that's critical, because the -- the issue is not whether it's conceivable that an injury could occur from the violation.   It could.   And what you have indicated about difficulty clearing objections to a title, for example, if there was a problem that she had with respect to that and she believed it was the case, that would actually be the job of the title agent, which -- and there is no allegation that she was improperly referred to the title agent.   So the insurer is issuing -- underwriting the policy and bears the residual risk, but it's the agent that is actually engaged with the -- with the plaintiff here.   And there, the agent's name here was Tower City. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Suppose Congress makes a finding; this is the finding: We think that lawyers or whoever is engaged in these who hire title insurance companies should hire the best one on the merits, not on the basis of which one will give them the biggest kickback.   We think that's so because that will help keep people secure.   Everyone in such -- who buys a house will feel more secure knowing that the market worked there.   We can't prove who feels insecure and who doesn't.   We think in general they would, and so we give everybody the right to recover $500 if they are injured, where the injury consists of being engaged in a transaction where the title insurance company was not chosen on the merits, but was chosen in whole or in part on the basis of the kickback.   And they write that right into the statute, so therefore there is no doubt that the plaintiff here suffered the harm that Congress sought to forbid.   That harm was being engaged in a transaction where the title insurance company was not chosen on the merits, but partly in terms of a kickback.   Now, what in the Constitution forbids Congress from doing that? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " The Constitution, Article III, as this Court has interpreted it, requires that a plaintiff that comes into court must have suffered an injury in fact, and Congress cannot create that injury legislatively.   Otherwise, the Congress can enlist the courts for regulatory purposes that are unrelated to the core function of the Court as this Court has articulated it. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --Mr. Panner, suppose there were a contract between Ms. Edwards and Tower and the contract had a no-kickback clause, not one that suggested that Ms. Edwards had to show any kind of injury, greater cost or lesser service, but just you can't have any kickbacks.   Can she sue on that contract? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Well, if it was a negotiated agreement and it was -- it was one where the parties had given value for that assurance, then that would represent something that there had been a judgment in advance by this particular individual that that was something that was a performance that she was willing to pay for and a promise that meant something to her, and so that would potentially be a different case. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And now suppose that Congress passes a law and says every contract of this kind has to have such a provision in it. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Would she now have standing? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Most likely not, Your Honor.   And the reason is that it's the difference between a contract that the parties engage in, where there would be a -- if there's a negotiated contract, it would be reasonable for the Court to say, well, there's value attached to the rights that the parties have bargained for here.   But it's different if Congress is using it as a mechanism to create injury legislatively, and in that circumstance the court would still have to determine whether there was injury in fact that would allow the Plaintiff to get into court. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But it's a different case.   Could Congress decree that the agent in this case shall be an agent of the purchaser rather than an agent of the title insurance company, as is done in real estate, I think?   The real estate broker must be an agent of the seller and not of the purchaser.   Can it establish a trust relationship between the purchaser here and the person selecting the title insurance company? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Well, I think that Congress could potentially create a trust relationship. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " And if it did, would the violation of that trust relationship constitute injury for -- for Article III purposes? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Well, it would depend, Your Honor.   Not per se.   It would depend on whether there was some way in which that violation caused an injury in fact.   So, for example -- first of all, to the extent that there was some-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " We don't require injury in fact for most breaches of trust, do we? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --You do, Your Honor.   That is to say that in the case of any of the examples that the plaintiff has cited there is an underlying interest, an antecedent interest, a concrete interest in property or in an economic opportunity, paid-for services of an agent, and it is that concrete interest which is invaded by the -- by the alleged violation of the responsibility of trust.   But of course here you don't even have that relationship of trust.   As-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, I understand, but I'm just saying that that concrete interest can be created by Congress instead of being created by contract.   What difference does it make?   If you become a trustee by contract you get one result, but if you are a trustee by government decree so that you must be a trustee, contract or not, somehow the situation changes? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --I don't -- I don't think the situation would change.   I guess what I'm saying is that even -- I don't see any of the common law cases involving trusts, trustees, as involving recoveries or suits in the absence of what this Court would certainly consider to be an injury in fact, that is to say some harm to a concrete interest that exists apart from the statutory duty or the common law duty. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Panner, in response to Justice Scalia's questions and my questions, you are suggesting that there is a difference depending on what the source of the law is.   If the source of the right is a contract, there is one result.   If the source of the right is a statute, there is another result.   And I thought that that was very much -- that is -- that's very much inconsistent with our case law, and specifically with Lujan. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " I certainly didn't mean to say that, Your Honor, so let me try to clarify.   The question was, there are circumstances in which the legal relationship is such that there could be -- let me back up.   The question is whether there is an injury in fact, that is to say a harm that exists as a factual matter, and those interests certainly can be reflected by the legal duties that are created.   So, for example, there are legal duties in contract that are intended to protect the interests of the contracting parties.   There are legal duties under the law of trust that are intended to protect the beneficiary.   But this Court has frequently reflected the fact that there is the question of the violation, but then there is separately the question of the injury.   And the point that I'm making -- and it should be the same answer with respect to your question and Justice Scalia's -- is if the mere fact of a violation of a duty does not create injury per se, and none of the cases reflect that, and that is the proposition that plaintiff relies on here, precisely because of what she alleged and what she is attempting, the type of case that she is attempting to bring.   She is attempting to bring a case in which the statutory violation is the injury.   No other injury is required.   She very straightforwardly says, it does not matter if there is any economic harm, it does not matter if there is any quality difference, it does not matter if there is any consequential effect on me at all. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I'm not sure that that's the right understanding of her complaint.   She is saying: I don't have to prove those things because there's been a judgment made that these kinds of practices tend to decrease service and tend to increase price and therefore I don't have to prove those matters.   And that's the exact same judgment that is made in the trust cases, for example. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Again, I don't think that the trust cases can be fairly read to say that, Your Honor.   But the key point is that there is a distinction between what Congress -- the statutory duties that Congress can impose and the manner in which Congress can choose to have those enforced -- well-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Suppose she appended to her complaint an affidavit by a well-respected economist that says: Congress was right; these kind of arrangements will have an adverse effect on the people who are purchasing title insurance, and goes through all kinds of analyses that show that.   Would that be adequate then? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --Well, at the pleading stage it might be, Your Honor.   That is to say that if the question were whether there was an allegation, certainly it's possible that there could be a sufficiently concrete allegation in a complaint that there was that sort of an impact, but -- and this is critical -- not only was that not alleged here, but the mere fact that there is a statutory duty does not reflect that's the judgment or, you know, the fact that there's been any sort of many systemic effect.   Congress has broadly prohibited practices involving kickbacks and the paradigm case has nothing to do with a situation in which a title insurance agent is issuing a title insurance policy for an underwriter.   Now, it's not to say that Congress can't pass a broader prohibition and -- you know, and require that it be enforced.   Well, Congress can pass a broader prohibition and then the executive could enforce it.   But what Congress cannot do is to dictate in advance that a particular practice has caused injury to a particular plaintiff. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Counsel, I'm still having problems. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Just following up Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, suppose the Congress works with economists and concludes there is a reasonable probability that if there were no kickbacks there would be a more competitive market, there would be lower prices for some of the escrow fees, some of the collateral fees in addition to the title insurance.   And the plaintiff then alleges that there is this reasonable probability that there would be a more efficient market, resulting in cost savings.   Would that be enough? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Well, Your Honor, there has to be a connection between the violation alleged and the harm that ensues, and so a general understanding that-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

"}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --I understand that, Your Honor.   So the question would be particular to the allegations that were made.   In a case like this one, it's in all likelihood a generic allegation that there had been -- that there was some sort of systemic effect is -- it would be insufficient.   That would be a speculative sort of claim of harm and that would be really something where if it's a general systemic effect with no traceability between the violation that's alleged and any supposed harm to the plaintiff, that that would be something for the executive.   Mr. Chief Justice, if I can reserve-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

I mean, certainly there are all sorts of circumstances where there is broad systemic harm, but yet the harm to the plaintiff is very clear, if you think about, for example, about price-fixing.

And may it please the Court:   For at least 280 years the law has been clear that when someone breaches a duty of loyalty owed to you by taking a kickback or otherwise introducing a conflict into a transaction, you can sue on the basis of that alone, without showing a further harm in terms of economic loss.

I mean, as I heard it, he was reiterating what used to be called a prudential rule of standing.   It wasn't constitutional, but you looked to see if the statute is meant to protect this kind of person against that kind of harm, all right?   And if not, there is lack of prudential standing.   Well, if that's the test, his case would fall outside it, because the tax law is not meant to protect the plaintiff there, but this case would fall within it. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " I think it's more than prudential standing.   It goes to what is an injury in fact, which the Court has again repeatedly explained is an invasion of a legally protected interest that is sufficiently concrete and particularized.   No, we don't think that Congress can, through the guise of a right, convert a generalized interest in enforcement of the law into something that an individual can come into-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --What -- why do we always say injury in fact then?   You say so long as the harm is a violation of the law in legally protected interest.   Our standing cases always say injury in fact as opposed to injury in law.   And you are saying if you violate the law, you have sufficient injury. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " --Well, your cases actually say an injury in fact.   And then you go on to explain.   For instance, in Defenders of Wildlife, that that is invasion of a legally protected interest.   I'm not saying it's any invasion of a law, but when Congress confers a right-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Because -- they also go on to say that it has to be concrete.

It is a legal label that the Court has applied to-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " The difference between legal harm, though -- isn't that -- I guess I'm just repeating myself.   Injury in fact.   How do you understand that to be different than any other kind of injury? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " --Well, an injury in fact is not simply a legal injury in the sense of any violation of the law, it is an invasion of a legally protected interest with respect to this particular individual, the particular plaintiff. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " The two elements, that's the particularized requirement, and I understand that.   But you are saying there's -- injury in fact simply means particularized. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " No, no, no, no.   It includes several concepts.   An injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest.   It either has to be actual or imminent, and it has to be concrete and particularized.   Now, again, so there's several concepts within the umbrella of injury in fact.   But I'd like to go back to the examples that we would find at the time of the framing, of many types of injuries, where you don't have to have anything other than an invasion of your legally protected right.   For instance, a right to an agreement.   If there is a breach that has no impact whatsoever, you would be able to get in and sue.   Now, there is a question of the quantification of damage, but that's separate.   That's not whether you have an injury in fact, it is how -- it's the measure of damages, and the measure of damages in common law would be nominal damages.   Similarly, an invasion -- a trespass invasion, or, for instance, if you were a beneficiary of a-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I'm not sure about trespass.   The object of my owning property is that I have a right to exclude.   This is what I own.   This is what the law protects.   This is a spatial area for -- for my -- which is my own domain.

Now-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " --But if the right's threatened-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

Yang", "text": " --Well, going back to your hypothetical, the reason you have that interest, the reason you have the right to exclude this space is solely by operation of the law.   Those concepts, they are attached to property rights, were created by common law courts.   Just as common law courts can create rights, the invasion of which create interest, so too can a State legislature or when Congress is acting within its Article III power to the one power-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Trespass cases, it seems to me, are different because you are talking about a property right, and you can sell a property right.   You can go to somebody and say I have the right to keep people off of this piece of property.   Do you want to buy it?   Here's how much it's worth.   But if -- that's only a property right to the extent you can keep people off of it.   Here no one is going to buy this right from the -- the -- the plaintiff, because everybody's got it anyway.   You don't -- you don't pay her, because she doesn't have a tangible concrete right.   The trespass case, the person obviously does, because he can sell it. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A.

[Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " --Well, it is -- it's kind of a statement, although you know in this -- this is specific transaction, this is a transaction involving the plaintiff.   She paid money for a service that she got, and it was unlawfully tainted by a kickback and that's the type of thing that traditionally can be enforced in court. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Yang.   Mr. Panner, you have 4 minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   It seems to me that there are two positions that have been articulated before the Court and both are inconsistent with the Court's prior decisions.   The first is-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Not yours and his?   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " --That of the -- that of the plaintiff and that of the government, Your Honor.   I should have been more particularized.   [Laughter]   The violation of a duty owed to us, that is what plaintiff claims is the injury here.   The violation of a duty is a violation of a duty; it is not injury.   And similarly the government says that what is required is a sufficient connection to the conduct, but what is required is not a connection to the conduct, what is required is an injury-in-fact, a harm to the plaintiff who is seeking to obtain redress from the courts.   And that fundamental limitation on the role of the courts is critical to the liberty of the people who come before the courts and who are subject to the power of the courts.   It is absolutely appropriate for someone who has been harmed through the violation of a statutory or common law duty owed to that person to come before the court seeking redress, but what is not possible is for the courts to be open to a plaintiff who has not alleged that the statutory duty -- the statutory violation that has been alleged has caused any adverse impact.   Now of course there are broadly -- there are -- there is illegal conduct that may have caused harm to a broad section of the population.   If somebody engages in price fixing and then sells those price fixed goods it may be easy to show that as a result of that many people suffered harm and can come into court to sue for it.   Similarly, there are non-financial harms that for are the basis for standing in many, many cases: example, defamation, harm to reputation, discrimination where somebody is subject to a -- an injury of being discriminated against.

What do you say about that? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron M. Panner", "text": " Well, Your Honor, in -- in a circumstance in which there is a bargain for performance, and it may well be that there is a recognition that there is value that was assigned to that performance that may be hard to measure, and therefore there is a concrete injury that is hard to measure, and the therefore nominal damages is awarded.   Now the cases are not uniform on whether nominal damages are available.   There is a -- it's actually split and that there's -- we are not aware of a case in this Court that would say that in a circumstance in which there was a harmless breach, that -- that a suit for nominal damages would establish Article III standing, so with respect to that I'm -- I'm not sure what the answers would be.   Unless the Court has further questions? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
