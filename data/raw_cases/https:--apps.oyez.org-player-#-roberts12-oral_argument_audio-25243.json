[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case 19-5807, Edwards versus Vannoy. Mr. Belanger. "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: \"A verdict by 11 is no verdict at all\" is a line from the Court earlier this year that ended Louisiana's nonunanimous jury scheme.   On paper, it restored the full breadth of the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right to Louisianans. But we need to place the effect of this ruling into perspective.   This laudable ruling would only apply to cases then pending or recently adjudicated.   It meant nothing to Mr. Edwards, who is serving a life sentence at Angola for a verdict that would be illegal everywhere else, as Louisiana is the only place that would jail you for natural life on a nonunanimous verdict. Ultimately, the question before the Court is, why should the Sixth Amendment mean something less to Mr. Edwards? Members of the Ramos Court were divided on how to reconcile the fractured decision in Apodaca with then existing precedent.   This division cleared two paths to holding that Ramos applies retroactively under Teague, two paths for providing a remedy to those jailed by a jury scheme we know was morally wrong at its inception and is unconstitutional. For some justices, Apodaca was dead on arrival since its deciding votes rationale was foreclosed by precedent.   For these justices, Apodaca provided no precedential value and Ramos is an old rule dictated by president -- precedent that simply restored the Sixth Amendment's full measure either through the Due Process Clause or the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For other justices, Apodaca was such a wrongly decided decision that it needed to be explicitly overruled.   For these members of the Court, Ramos should be a watershed rule requiring retroactivity as this restores fairness and accuracy to jury trials in Louisiana. Both paths remedy something we all know to be wrong.   Both paths will provide the promise of a fair trial to all Louisianans. Mr. Chief Justice, I'm ready to entertain questions from the Court. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   I -- I think your biggest hurdle is the Court's decision in DeStefano, where we held that the jury trial right itself should not be applied retroactively.   What -- what we're talking about here is a subordinate right to a unanimous verdict, a lesser included right.   How do -- how do you get around DeStefano? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " There's two considerations I would like to bring to the Court's attention.   DeStefano itself was just dealing with the judge's ability to make a decision, and as this Court noted in Duncan, you cannot say whether or not necessarily that a judge-rendered decision is more or less accurate than a jury-rendered decision.   Our case here deals with the in -- intricacies of what goes on in the jury room. I will also note that I think the more analogous case, Mr. Chief Justice, is the Brown decision.   It too provided the same retroactivity standard that was incorporated in DeStefano which relied heavily on state interest, and that decided to apply the Burch decision retroactively, which prevented Louisiana from having nonunanimous petit juries. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You know, in Ramos, five of us thought that Apodaca was a precedent that was being overruled and therefore it was the most compelling evidence that it was a new rule.   Were those five justices unreasonable? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, when we get to the reasonableness standard of -- of -- of the jurists, it's on objective criterion.   I think that we can all agree that the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous jury and that we can all agree that the Bill of Rights are fully incorporated to the states at this point. Normally, the reasonable jurist standard goes hand in hand with being dictated by precedent, but Apodaca was such a bizarre decision that it broke those two hands apart, and that's why it is in a unique universe of one, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I think, particularly given your answer on DeStefano, that -- that you have something of a burden of establishing that the unanimous jury is -- is necessary to avoid an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction. What -- what is your best empirical evidence for that? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, I have two. First is we have amici have provided some statistics on the actual exonerations coming out of Louisiana.   Of the 65 or so cases that they've identified, half of those cases were eligible for a nonunanimous verdict, and from that population of half, half of those, or one quarter of the 65, were actual exonerations of nonunanimous jury verdicts. I would also turn the Court's attention to a law review article published in Notre Dame after Gideon versus Wainwright was decided written by Abe Krash.   It's the Right to a Lawyer: The Implications of Gideon versus Wainwright. Krash was the -- one of the brief authors in Gideon, and he reported data in that that Florida at that time had about 8,000 people in jail and 4500 of those were jailed without a lawyer.   And -- and -- and so the system accounted for that.   If -- if Gideon's going to be our watershed rule, we -- we can look to see just the numbers there, and they're radically different from what we have here. And -- and so you -- you have a system where we look to see whether or not the system itself was fair, and a nonunanimous jury is not fair because it flies in the historical tradition of this country. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, we agree this is a -- unlike Montgomery, this is a procedural rule.   So can you -- other than Gideon, can you think of another case where we have said that a procedural rule was retroactive? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, not since Teague. But, when we go back to the Brown decision, that was applied -- that was applying Burch retroactively, and it dealt with the same issue of unanimity in a Louisiana jury trial. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " The -- on your statistics that you -- or the data that you just suggested about unanimous versus nonunanimous juries, how do you respond to the arguments on the other side that the statistics and the studies are a mixed bag and really doesn't move the dial very much one way or the other? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, we have to look at whether or not the process seems fair.   Our tradition puts together the reasonable doubt and the unanimous jury together.   We want people to come together as a community to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this person needs to be deprived of their liberty. And -- and -- and so there -- there are studies that suggest that the effectiveness of deliberation is simply cut short when you don't have to have a unanimous jury, and that systemically leads to the possibility of an inaccurate conviction. When we go back to those Gideon numbers out of Florida I just mentioned, I mean, certainly, not all of the 4500 people would have been convicted, but we're talking about more than half the population in the jail at that time.   It leaves room for the premise that the system can be inaccurate and unfair even though it may in -- in -- in many instances lead -- lead to conceivably the right decision. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " But I don't know how you can -- how it translates a right to counsel versus a unanimous jury.   What has the Court said -- what have we said in our cases about nonunanimous juries? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, going back to the Brown decision, it was required, that, you know, Burch and Brown both required unanimous juries. And -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " We've had Apodaca on the book for -- books for quite some time.   I think the cases we have actually, if not endorsed it, certainly saw it sitting comfortably, if not awkwardly, with our case law. "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " I would respectfully disagree with that.   While this Court has acknowledged Apodaca for quite some time, I do not believe that Apodaca was used for what it's being argued to stand for and thus we're going to have a watered-down Bill of Rights.   You know, it -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Let me ask you -- let me change a bit and go a little bit different direction.   Let's assume that the Court finds that this is retroactive.   How do you get around the relitigation bar in 2254(d)(1) of AEDPA? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Sure.   I -- I have two points to make on that. First, if the Court were just simply to decide retroactivity and save for another day any procedural objections, this case will go back down to the Louisiana courts, where we will have a -- a viable claim to make on state post-conviction. Secondly, when we go down to a -- well, first of all, I don't necessarily agree that there was a decision on the merits for starters for purposes of (d)(1), but even if the Court were inclined to think there was, when we go to (e)(2)(A), subsection 1, new rules made retroactively by the United States Supreme Court would allow petitions like Mr. Edwards' to get in under a different portion of AEDPA. So, you know, I don't think when you read those two statutes together that they should -- it -- it really necessarily poses a problem. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Thank you. How -- how many approximate -- what's your rough estimate of -- if you win, how many new trials in Louisiana will be called for? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " At -- at this point, we believe the maximum population is 1600 people. I do not believe that all of those 1600 people will be able to establish that they had a nonunanimous jury.   I think amici did a good job breaking down the statistics.   And it's probably closer to a thousand. And from that, there's different subsets.   Some of these people will either be eligible for parole soon, or they will benefit from a change on the habitual offender law, or they are also in jail for a very significant unanimous jury conviction. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And can the Louisiana system handle that? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Oh, yes, sir.   I mean, we're -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " How -- "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " -- only talking about -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- about how many trials are there in a year in -- in Louisiana? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " I don't know the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Or how -- "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " -- I do not know the exact number.   It varies by jurisdiction, but I believe there's 145,000 cases filed per year, and we're really looking at our estimates of maybe two to three cases per prosecutor.   So the -- the system is more than capable of accommodating this type of caseload. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " This whole quest for watershed rules is rather strange.   We keep saying there were some in the past that were discovered, but it's not clear that there are any new -- any new ones that haven't yet been discovered, but, you know, maybe, just maybe there might be a watershed rule out there that hasn't been discovered. It -- I mean, it sort of reminds me of something you see on some TV shows about the -- the quest for an animal that was thought to have become extinct, like the Tasmanian tiger, which was thought to have died out in a zoo in 1936, but every once in a while, deep in the forests of Tasmania, somebody sees a footprint in the mud or a howl in the night or some fleeting thing running by, and they say, a-ha, there still is one that exists. So, I mean, all of that is a wind-up to getting back to the question that Justice Thomas asked.   Why should we decide whether this Teague exception applies to a habeas petition brought by a state prisoner without first deciding whether it's barred by AEDPA? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, the retroactivity issue, as -- as I said earlier, new rules made retroactive by the United States Supreme Court can be litigated by another portion of AEDPA. Secondly, I do believe that there is a legit -- legitimate disagreement as to whether or not this case was actually decided on the merits in state post-conviction.   My recollection of what we had happen on the record below is that we were summarily dismissed for no legal or -- or -- or factual basis.   So I don't believe the -- the merits were fully addressed. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Another oddity about applying the -- the watershed rule inquiry in this particular case is that the test for a watershed rule depends pretty heavily on Justice Harlan's decision, his opinion in the Mackey case, which -- where he relied on exactly the rationale, the concept of ordered liberty, Palko versus Connecticut rationale, that the lead opinion in Ramos excoriated.   So is it -- would it be consistent to apply it here? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I do think this is a -- a watershed rule.   There are so many parallels between this case and Gideon. Both recognized fundamental bedrock principles, and both had to deal with cases that were inconsistent with those principles and restore the -- the fundamental rights at issue.   For Gideon, it was the right to appointed counsel, and, here, it's the unanimous jury requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, isn't part of a watershed rule inquiry whether it's consistent with ordered liberty? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, it -- it is, and I don't know how we can say that a nonunanimous -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, but didn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " -- jury is -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- didn't Justice -- didn't Justice Gorsuch's opinion repudiate that, ridicule that approach? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, I read Justice Gorsuch's opinion as not finding precedential force with Apodaca. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, and Justice Powell's opinion in Apodaca was based on what? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, Justice Powell thought that the Sixth Amendment wasn't fully incorporated to the states, and we know that to be wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And he thought it wasn't incorporated for what reason? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " He didn't believe that the Sixth Amendment was -- was fully incorporated through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Is that all prisoners that are in jail currently, whether it's a year old or not or post- -- past their AEDPA time? Is that the total prison population?

And so your statistic is based -- you're saying some of them may not be able to prove that they were convicted by a -- a nonunanimous verdict, is that correct?

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Why are you guessing a thousand? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Based on amici's efforts to pull the court records on those 1600 people.   They haven't been able to establish that yet.   But, even for purposes of just assuming that all 1600 could prove it, it is still the burden on the petitioner to show that they had a nonunanimous jury.   And -- and -- and there are many instances we may find that lawyers didn't simply ask for the polling.   We -- that would just be on a case-by-case basis. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   Thank you, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Belanger, as you know, I thought that Apodaca was a precedent, so you would have a very steep climb to get me to think that Ramos was anything other than a new rule.   So I want to focus on the watershed inquiry, and in that inquiry, we've talked a lot about accuracy.   And I think somebody previously asked you about your empirical evidence, and I'll just give you sort of my sense that the empirics here are sparse, maybe surprisingly sparse, as to how this unanimity requirement works with respect to what I take to be the ordinary meaning of \"accuracy,\" which is simply a reduction in the error rate in trials. And -- and so too it seems like one's intuition is not necessarily in your corner, that it might be that the unanimity rule allows more guilty people to go free than it -- than it stops innocent people from being convicted, or at least it's just not certain. So I -- I guess what I -- I'd like to ask you is whether your -- well, I mean, number one, do you just contest all of everything that I just said? But, number two, are -- are you talking about accuracy in some different sense? Your first sentence to us was, \"A verdict by a nonunanimous jury is no verdict at all.\" And then you talked about a verdict can be inaccurate and unfair even though it leads to the right decision. And I guess what I'm asking is, are you talking about and do you think in our cases we've been talking about accuracy in some different sense than simply the reduction of errors in whatever direction? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " I -- I do not think that accuracy needs to necessarily be statistics-driven.   I've just provided the statistics that were available for illustrative purposes.   \"A verdict by 11 is no verdict at all\" is an accurate statement the way -- the -- the way the framers intended the Sixth Amendment jury trial right to be. I go back again to Gideon, which this Court has recognized as the exemplar for the watershed rule.   If the figures in that Notre Dame article were accurate, we're talking about three times as many more people as we have affected in Louisiana, and we're also talking about half of that prison population, where, here, we may be talking about 5 percent. I -- I do believe it is a -- a systemic approach to say whether or not a trial that's deprived someone of his liberty with not a unanimous verdict is fair. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Could I ask you about your argument which hasn't come up so far today but featured prominently in your briefs about the racial aspect of -- of -- of this rule, picking up on Justice Gorsuch's opinion and Justice Kavanaugh's opinion about how this rule started as a -- the nonunanimity rule started as a racially discriminatory one. How does that play into the Teague analysis and how can it play given that we've held Batson non- -- nonretroactive? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, I -- I think this is a case that is different than Batson.   A -- a Batson case is something where you're looking at the particular actions of an individual prosecutor in an individual case.   And Batson requires speculation.   We don't know if there would have been a unanimous verdict or not with a Batson-compliant jury. Here, we know.   We can -- we can show that this was not a unanimous verdict.   We had at least one juror and sometimes two jurors vote not guilty.   And the types of cases that we'll be talking about moving forward, the burden will be on the petitioner to show I actually had a nonunanimous jury.   And -- and so it is measurable, whereas Batson was not. I do think that the racial origins of the -- the -- the nonunanimous jury is something to consider.   It shows that this type of system was set up for the purpose of not being accurate, for the purpose of not being fair. And even though the state has tried to cleanse itself, it still has a negative racially disproportionate impact today. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Gorsuch. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Good morning, counsel.   I'd like to start with your first argument, that Ramos did not announce a new rule.   I -- I'm certainly sympathetic to that point of view.   I believe the Court had, for well over 100 years, spoken about the unanimity requirement, as you know. But only a plurality agreed with me on that, and -- and there were a couple of joiners who thought that Apodaca was a precedent of the Court.   A single justice speaking for himself defined existing precedent was nonetheless itself a precedent that we had to abide.   And, of course, the dissenters took that point of view. How -- how -- how can we get to where you want us to go in that light? Do we account for the dissenters' position? Should we discount the dissenters' position? Even if we do discount that, what about the fact that the -- the majority itself had different views? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " I would have two responses. First, I believe you all's opinion in -- in Ramos did set up two paths for the Court to decide retroactivity. Secondly, I don't -- while the -- I respect the dissenters' viewpoint and realize that may be how they feel today, I do not necessarily count the votes in dissent to say explicitly we've overruled Ramos -- Apodaca, rather.   I apologize. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So I'm -- I'm just -- just flesh that out for me a little bit more as to how you see this as not a rule, not a new rule.   You know, certainly, Justice Ginsburg and -- and -- and Justice Breyer and I thought that's correct, but some of the other joiners even in the majority did not.   What about them, if you -- if you have us discount the dissent? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Yeah.   So, you know, the Sixth Amendment has always required unanimity, and then going back to the Malloy versus Hogan decision, we have said that we do not have a watered down Bill of Rights so that the two lines of precedent there, Sixth Amendment requires unanimity and that the Sixth Amendment is fully incorporated to the states, leads to one logical conclusion and that is that Louisiana had to apply a unanimous jury scheme. And -- and -- and, you know, Justice Powell's decision is just a -- a unique opinion. It is one that requires us, if we -- if we are to follow it, to go -- to take a -- what's considered a -- a fundamental Bill of Right and marry it up to something that was foreclosed as at the time the opinion was given, and I just don't think that that's something you'll ever see ever again. I -- I think, when we sit down people to explain that these are the two lines of precedent, Louisiana has a 10-2 system, do you think that would hold water, I think people would say no if they did not know about the Apodaca decision. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I surely hope you're right. With respect to the watershed route, your alternative route, you -- you -- you've gotten different variations of the question, but I -- I guess the way I'd -- I'd put it is Teague holds out this promise that there's going to be some watershed rule in the hands of Gideon as an example, which predates Teague, of course. But then, ever since, we haven't -- we haven't found a single one.   Is -- is this a false promise? If it is, should we just admit it's a false promise? If it isn't a false promise, then what counts, what principle counts if DeStoff -- DeStefano doesn't count, Ring doesn't count, Batson doesn't count, Crawford doesn't count? Are we -- are we just -- who are we kidding and -- and what should we do about it? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Your -- Your Honor, I -- I -- I -- I couldn't frame it better. It's -- for Teague to mean anything, there has to be something that counts, and that's why I think that Ramos is more analogous to Gideon than any of these other cases that we have decided in the past. Both decisions restored our understanding of fundamental bedrock principles. Both of these decisions took away a -- a -- a case that deviated from those prior precedents. And because you'll never see an opinion like Apodaca again, we can all rest assured that this is not going to open any type of floodgate. This has to be a watershed rule if you find that Apodaca was explicitly overruled by Ramos. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Thank you, Counsel. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh? "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, counsel.   I had been concerned that your approach would require us to chart a new path on retroactivity.   As Justice Thomas and Justice Alito pointed out, we have a long line of cases, and you were just discussing with Justice Gorsuch post-Teague cases, such as Whorton about the Crawford rule and -- and many others where we have declined to apply a new rule retroactively on collateral. I'm also, though, concerned about the -- some of the pre-Teague cases which I think are on point here.   The Chief Justice brought up DeStefano.   You've -- you've equated Ramos to Gideon.   The dissenters in DeStefano equated the jury trial right itself to Gideon, Justice Douglas and Justice Black, in their dissents, and I just want to give you an opportunity.   The -- the -- the jury trial right not applying retroactively but the unanimous jury right applying retroactively on collateral review seems like an asymmetry. "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Sure.   Two -- two responses to that. First of all, I think we have to remember that DeStefano was decided by a different standard of retroactivity than Teague. And the three factors in existence at that time, two of them were heavily relate -- weighted towards the state's reliance interest that was reliance about law enforcement and the overall effect on the administrative -- administration of justice with the retroactive application.   Those two enumerated factors are removed from Teague analysis.   We just have to focus on fairness and accuracy. And -- and -- and the second point is that that issue would -- would -- would have required the Court to say that a judge-made decision is somehow so inconsistent in accuracy and fairness than with a -- a jury decision. And -- and that has not been the position of this Court, so it is a bit different. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.   On the Batson angle, as you know, in Ramos, I thought the Batson precedent was an important -- important one in thinking about how the nonunanimous jury actually operated in practice, and I think Batson is a -- a landmark opinion and one of the more important opinions in this Court's history in terms of ensuring that trials occur without racial discrimination. Yet, in Allen v. Hardy, we did not apply Batson retroactively.   I know Justice Kagan referenced this with you.   And that's, I guess, another asymmetry I'm concerned about here in -- in this case.   And your distinction of -- of Allen v. Hardy would be? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, it -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " -- I'm sorry, my distinction, Your Honor, would be that Allen versus Hardy was also using the pre-Teague standards that heavily relied upon the reliance factors of the state. And, secondly, with -- again, with Batson challenges, they're hard to measure. You -- you just do not know if a Batson-compliant jury would or would not have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, I think that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " -- whereas, here, I can measure it. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yeah, that's -- I -- I think that's a fair point. Lastly, I wanted to mention, you've several times cited Brown versus Louisiana.   And I agree with you the plurality there is supportive of you, but the opinion that -- that was decisive was the concurring opinion of Justice Powell and Justice Stevens, and they would have applied Burch retroactively only on direct -- to cases pending on direct, not on collateral.   Any response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Yes.   You know, with the -- the Teague analysis now, we do really make that distinction between direct and collateral review, but Brown was illustrative of the fact that the standard at that time applied the same standards on direct and on collateral review.   I -- I think the -- the premise that unanimity was required and under a standard of review applicable at the time, it was. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Barrett? "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Belanger, I want to press you a little bit more on Justice Kagan's questions to you about what accuracy means, because when I heard your answers to Justice Kagan, it was hard for me to distinguish between your view of the accuracy prong and your view of the bedrock procedural element prong, the fairness of the proceeding, because you kept saying, well, it's possible for a nonunanimous jury verdict to have reached the right result, i.e., maybe convicting someone who actually, in fact, had committed the crime, while still being unfair. Can you -- can you help me understand a -- a little bit more how your two prongs are distinct of what \"accuracy\" means? "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Yeah.   Well, the -- the accuracy component is we're looking to see whether or not the -- the -- the system of how the trial took place was fair. And in -- in Gideon versus Wainwright, we have said that all of these cases where people were not represented by counsel was not fair.   But I can't tell you today how many of those people would have been exonerated. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well -- well, right. "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " But this is -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " You may not be able to identify a specific number, but, I mean, I think what Gideon was saying is that there is a significant chance that someone may have been convicted when he otherwise would not have been or when it was -- it reached the wrong result. I -- I guess I don't understand -- you know, you've got statistics saying that in Louisiana, as many unanimous verdict defendants have been exonerated or even more than those who had been convicted by nonunanimous juries, or that Oregon has a lower rate per capita of exonerations than those states that do have unanimous rights. So -- so what does it mean? Are we trying to ask whether juries wrongfully convicted someone because the majority saw the case in the wrong way and the -- and the one dissenter in the jury or the two dissenters in the jury were right? Can you just -- I'm just having trouble understanding what we're measuring. "}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Well, this type of verdict would not be a verdict anywhere else but Oregon.   So, fundamentally, at its premise, it is not a conviction. The -- trying to look at -- at fairness in -- in dealing with how this can -- how this jury verdict can -- can stand, I have to go back to why it was created in the first place.   This jury scheme was created so it would not be accurate, so it could disproportionately impact a segment of the population.   And it is true that it still has those negative effects even today.

For members of this Court who viewed Apodaca as an anomaly that did not alter prevailing constitutional standards, Ramos was logically dictated by precedent and set out an old rule.   For members of this Court who viewed Ramos as announcing a new rule, it is a watershed rule of criminal procedure akin to Gideon. Jury unanimity predates the founding and ranks amongst our most indispensable rights. It significantly improves the accuracy and fairness because a verdict taken from 11 is no verdict at all. The state has no legitimate interests in avoiding retroactivity.   Louisiana's nonunanimous jury scheme was thoroughly racist and discriminatory in its origin.   As members of this Court said in Ramos, we should not perpetuate something we all know to be wrong only because we fear the consequences of being right. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. General Murrill. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Murrill", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Louisiana adopted its 10-2 jury verdict rule in 1974 after a new constitutional convention where delegates expressly relied on Apodaca v. Oregon and Johnson v. Louisiana when revising its criminal procedures. Petitioner minimizes Louisiana and Oregon's reliance interests and dismisses Puerto Rico's entirely.   But there can be no doubt that declaring the Ramos rule retroactive unsettles thousands of cases that involve terrible crimes in all three jurisdictions.   Requiring new trials in long-final criminal cases would be impossible in sum and particularly unfair to the victims of these crimes. Ramos is unquestionably a new rule. This Court has held on numerous occasions that a discarded precedent is the clearest sign of a new rule.   Six justices in Ramos agreed that Apodaca was a binding precedent.   And virtually every jurist, state and federal, addressing the issue before Ramos viewed it that way as well for almost 50 years. Petitioner concedes that Ramos announced a procedural rule so Ramos only applies retroactively if it's a watershed rule. While undoubtedly important, Ramos isn't a watershed rule.   A supermajority verdict does not render a trial fundamentally unfair, nor does it seriously undermine factual accuracy of the verdict.   In some cases, unanimity might improve accuracy, but in others, it might diminish it. Here, Edwards confessed to rape and armed robbery and was identified by one of his victims.   Because Ramos was decided long after Edwards' conviction became final, the Teague retroactivity bar should prevent him and others like him from benefiting from Ramos's holding. This Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit's denial of a Certificate of Appealability. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

So that -- doesn't that discount the conclusion that it's a new decision if it's -- it's not the same as overruling a typical precedent? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Murrill", "text": " No, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that -- so for -- so, for one thing, I think that the question is what -- how lower courts would have perceived it when they were applying the rule at the time.   And this Court even in Ramos recognized that the Court itself has been studiously ambiguous and even inconsistent about what Apodaca might mean. But there's no question that its result was binding.   I think its result was always binding on lower courts.   And this Court has also very carefully guarded its right to overrule its own precedent.   Even where it was the result that was binding, it's not the reasoning. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And in this case, you know, there's a black defendant.   The state uses its peremptory strikes to strike all but one black juror -- uses four of its six peremptories against black venire persons -- strikes five blacks for cause because several of them -- in part, for several of them -- had a family history of incarceration.   And you're left with one black juror with a black defendant. And then you get a 11-to-1 verdict on the armed robbery count, the two kidnapping counts -- one of the armed robbery counts, two kidnapping counts, and the rape count.   And the one juror is the black -- black woman, the black juror. This case seems like a classic example of what we were concerned about with the combination of peremptory challenges being used on the basis of race, maybe not to strike every juror but to strike all but one, and then the nonunanimous jury system complementing the -- the peremptory challenges.

That result also reflects the purposes of federal collateral review.   As Teague emphasized, habeas is not a substitute for direct appeal.   When a criminal judgment obtained under the law at the time becomes final, it should stay final outside the very narrow -- narrow exceptions that are not satisfied here. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Isn't the right to a unanimous jury more important as a matter of factual accuracy than the right to a jury itself?

So I'm not sure that the fact that DeStefano is not retroactive really makes the case that this right shouldn't be. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher G.

I think the Court in Summerlin, for example, said that it's -- it's just hard to tell whether a judge or a jury is going to be more accurate.   And I think that that alone is enough to -- to show that petitioner can't meet the high standard here. But I take your point, even if you don't think DeStefano gets you all the way, the Court has repeatedly declined to find watershed other subsidiary jury rights, including in Teague itself, which both -- which both reaffirmed the Court's decision in Allen versus Hardy that Batson is not retroactive on collateral review and also rejected the fair cross-section requirement. So I think all of those subsidiary jury rights, including the unanimity right at issue here, simply don't meet the watershed test. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

As we mentioned in our brief, there is a sort of ripple effect from the vacator of these convictions on.

The Court in Whorton, for example, when discussing Crawford, made the point that confrontation could sometimes actually make -- make a -- a trial less accurate.   And the Court in Butler versus McKellar, when discussing the Fourth Amendment right at issue there, made the same point. So I think the Court has focused on factual accuracy.   But even if you were to adopt a more generous understanding of it and look to sort of the risk of wrongful convictions, I still think the right here doesn't -- doesn't come close, especially under this Court's decision in Johnson versus Louisiana, which expressly held that a nonunanimous jury verdict does not impugn the fairness or accuracy of the conviction.

I think Justice Gorsuch said you shouldn't double-count the reliance interest between stare decisis and retroactivity, and Justice Kavanaugh, of course, while recognizing those racial issues, seemed to suggest that this right shouldn't apply retroactively.

I do think it's notable that England, for example, you know, continues to use nonunanimous jury verdicts. And as the Court pointed out in Johnson versus Louisiana, you know, respected institutions in the Anglo American system, like the ABA and the ALI and respected professors, have all endorsed nonunanimous jury verdicts on legitimate grounds, such as avoiding hung juries. So I -- I do think, although the -- the Court, of course, concluded in Ramos that the text and history of the Sixth Amendment require unanimity, I don't think that's the same thing as saying that it is essential to accuracy and fairness under the inquiry the Court has outlined in Teague.

The Court -- majority of the Court in Montgomery versus Louisiana suggested that the substantive rule exception is rooted in the Constitution. The Court has not reached a similar determination with respect to the watershed rule exception, I think, in part, because it's never been applied, but if forced to confront that, I think we would say that's -- that's not constitutionally required and -- and it's supported by, at best, you know, an equitable determination similar to that that informs the retroactivity bar.

I think the -- the -- the -- the plurality opinion in Ramos importantly didn't rely on functional considerations like fairness and accuracy in -- in reaching its interpretation of the Sixth Amendment.   It said, you know, the unanimity requirement may serve purposes that evade our current notice.   And I think, you know, the most extensive discussion of that issue is found in Footnote 2 of Justice White's opinion in Apodaca, and, of course, that opinion is no longer governing. But it -- but the history is still valid, and it suggests a number of different historical bases for the unanimity requirement, including the medieval notion that, you know, one juror who disagreed would be committing perjury, which would have the consequence of damnation, and the medieval notion of consent, which, among other things, was manifested in the requirement that Parliament itself pass laws by unanimity.   So, you know, I -- I -- I do think there are some medieval origins of this that don't necessarily go to -- to accuracy or -- or fairness as we would think of it today. On -- on your first question, I do want to make the point, of course, that, you know, the substantive rule exception to -- to -- to Teague is alive and well, and the Court has found substantive rules recently.

None are likely to come forward, and it -- it is hard to see if -- if this doesn't qualify, which the founders thought was an essential component of the jury trial right, then it's pretty hard to see what might emerge that would qualify.

I guess I'd just close by saying, you know, this Court's decision in Ramos will have great significance going forward, but the question before the Court today is a different one. As -- as the Ramos plurality noted, it's the Teague doctrine that frees the Court to reconsider its constitutional decisions without having the risk of seriously disrupting wrong final judgments.   And we think that's the right result here. This petitioner was convicted of serious crimes after a full and fair trial.   His conviction became final almost a decade ago.   To retry him now would require, at minimum, making his victims relive their trauma, and in many other cases, a retrial might not be possible, causing disruptive effects in both the federal and the state systems.

"}, {"speaker": "Andre Belanger", "text": " Unanimity and reasonable doubt are two doctrines that work hand-in-hand to assure that we have a fair and accurate judicial system.   Gideon, Winship, and Ramos all point us to the realization that it is the legitimate risk of inaccuracy within the system that matters. As this Court said in Ballew, the risk of sending 10 innocent people to jail is greater than the risk of sending one guilty person free. Apodaca was an opinion that was dead on arrival because it predicated its decisive vote on analysis that was foreclosed by precedent at the time it was decided. Ramos removed this uncomfortable thorn from the side of our legal system, and, as such, it became a unique case which falls on a line that checks the boxes as being both an old rule and a new rule. First, Ramos is an old rule.   It ignores -- it -- it has followed preexisting precedent that was logically dictated by the case law that preceded it.   Ultimately, the state fails to dispute that jury unanimity and incorporation of the jury trial right are deeply rooted in American jurisprudence. Let's be clear, Ramos did not break any new ground under Teague. Second, for members of this Court who viewed Apodaca as precedent, Ramos announced a watershed rule of criminal procedure.   The state does not meaningfully address the parallels between Ramos and Gideon.   Both decisions restored bedrock Sixth Amendment principles, and both decisions compelled outlier states to apply rights they previously refused to recognize. A conviction can only be legally accurate if the state proves its case beyond a reasonable doubt of all jurors. The expressly racist origin of nonunanimous juries also contravene any state interest in finality and repose.   Since Ramos, members of this Court have recognized that the original motivation for the laws mattered, notwithstanding any subsequent re-ratification. The same is true here.   In the end, the state has no legitimate interest in avoiding retroactivity but for its desire to let Mr. Edwards languish in Angola for the rest of his life. On what grounds can we let this happen when we know his conviction is unconstitutional? The answer to that question is none. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
