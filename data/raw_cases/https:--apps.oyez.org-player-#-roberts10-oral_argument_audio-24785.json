[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-419, Dawson versus Steager. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State's exemption violates Section 111 and this Court's precedents because it facially discriminates based on the source of the compensation, as only retirement benefits from state retirement plans are exempted, and the State cannot show any significant differences between retired employees of the U.S. Marshals Service and the exempted state retirees because the State concedes that their job duties are the same. This Court should reverse. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What do we do with the fact that the job duties of marshals overlap with the two categories of the state? They overlap with the people paying less tax and with other law enforcement agents who pay more tax. So how do we go about identifying -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- who they're most similar to? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " -- two responses, Justice Sotomayor.   The first is the inquiry isn't who they're most similar to.   Under Davis, so long as the plaintiffs here, the U.S. Marshals, are similar to the exempted state employees, that's enough. That's because Section 111 provides an individual right against discrimination for federal employees.   And so, if there is a close case, for example, if there really were identical state employees, some who were exempted and some who weren't, that case would go to the federal employee because the -- there would still be discrimination because some state employees that are similarly situated are treated more favorably than the federal employees. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But what if there are two groups of state employees, let's say group 1 and group 2, and they're similarly situated to each other -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- and then a group of federal -- federal employees who are similarly situated to both group 1 and group 2? In that situation, does the State have to treat the federal employees the same as the most favored group, if group 1 has a favorable tax treatment, or does the State in that example have discretion since the federal employees are similarly situated to both group 1, who gets the favorable, and group 2, who does not? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh, the State has to treat the federal employees the same as the favored state employees.   The State has discretion to treat its own employees differently for various reasons, including arbitrary reasons, but once it does so through state taxation, the State has to treat the federal employees as well as the favored state employees.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- why that is so.   If the -- if you have two categories of state employees and they're very similar and they're treated differently, and then you have a category of federal employees who are similar to both of those categories of state employees, wouldn't you have to determine which group of state employees are most -- are more similar to the federal employees? Otherwise, it -- I don't see how it's discrimination. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " So, Justice Alito, I don't think you have to determine that because, again, it's an individual right against discrimination.   If this Court looks to the precedents like the ICC and railroad precedents from the 1930s, looks at Alabama versus CSX, when you're actually trying to figure out who you're comparing it to, you look at -- at who -- the language of the statute, the purpose of the statute, the context of the statute. And here, again, it -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But an antidiscrimination provision doesn't necessarily require a most favored nation clause.   And as I understand your answers to Justices Kavanaugh and Alito, you're saying there's a most favored nation requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Justice Kagan, two responses.   One, typically, you don't have a most favored nation requirement, as you note. Two, I'm not sure it's most favored here.   It's only that where the State has drawn sort of an arbitrary distinction and it's got effectively identically situated state employees, one that gets the exemption, one that doesn't, and the federal employee is similar to both, that this sort of comes in where the -- the tie here goes to the federal government.

I take it that police officers, firefighters, and others are exempt.   A few are not exempt.

Rosenberg", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, the larger group, as far as we can tell and the record reflects, is the state law enforcement personnel who are exempt.   It includes all state troopers, it includes all deputy sheriffs, for example. If we're actually comparing Mr. Dawson, he's plainly most like a deputy sheriff.   Under West Virginia law, sheriffs and deputy sheriffs have the same authority.   The only non-exempt individual that the State has tried to compare Mr. Dawson to is, in its brief in this Court, it tried to compare him to sheriffs.   But sheriffs and deputy sheriffs have the same job duties, have the same authority under West Virginia law. Mr. Dawson, in fact, was a deputy sheriff in West Virginia before he became a deputy United States Marshal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but there -- he -- he was different things.   He's not just somebody who was working in the Marshals Service.   He was for a while.

I would suspect he's not accompanying fugitives when they move from one -- I mean prisoners when they move from one place to another.   His job is, you know, more policy, administrative.

I mean, we have different comparators on the state side, but he himself embodies, at least arguably, two entirely different types of job. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " He embodies multiple jobs, but his basic duties as a law enforcement officer didn't change.   He had the same responsibilities as a law enforcement officer. Whether he was doing the same thing on a daily basis I don't think is the proper inquiry. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I don't think that's right.

"}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Well, he did work for quite a while as a deputy United States Marshal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, yeah, but I'm wondering whether or not we should be parsing out if part of his retirement seems similar and part not. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Well, I think it's all similar because, as a United States Marshal, even presidentially appointed, he still had the same law enforcement authority as the covered state employees. And this is the problem with the State's test.   The -- the inquiry shouldn't be is he identical to certain state employees; is -- it's whether he's similar enough that discriminatory tax treatment is justified. And the State can't justify discriminatory tax treatment just based on whether he has some additional administrative responsibilities, but his basic law enforcement function is the same. And the -- perhaps the most important point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the State has repeatedly conceded throughout the litigation that the job duties are the same. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Is the head of the Marshals Service covered? In other words, not one of the state marshals but the -- the head of the Marshals Service? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, he lives somewhere. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Yeah.   I mean, I think there may be an argument that he is.   I think that's a different case.   It would depend on the actual facts of the job duties.   I -- I think, in this case, whether it was deputy U.S. Marshal, U.S. Marshal, or when he was a deputy sheriff, pages JA 176 and 177 show that Mr. Dawson had the same job duties. The State's never contested that. And, indeed, as a U.S. Marshal, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Dawson testified at those pages that there were two critical similarities among others.   One was that he was entrusted to enforce West Virginia law as a U.S. Marshal. And the second was that, for fugitive task forces, he could deputize the very same state troopers and deputy sheriffs who are exempted under the West Virginia plan.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could I go back to the two categories? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Let's assume they're identical. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right? And I know that you're arguing that they're not, and this may be an issue, if we get to it, to remand, okay? But assuming they were, and if the difference was as articulated by Respondents here, one paid more than the other to the pension plan, so they -- the State wanted to be more generous to those who paid more, as I think is the case here. Why is that any different in kind to our suggestions in Davis and in other places that, if a scheme relied on the benefits paid out, anybody who made less than $15,000 a year in retirement benefits was exempt, but someone who made more wasn't, why is that different in kind to this situation? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Several responses, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's different in kind here because it's not the line the State drew.   The State didn't draw a line based on benefits. They could have.   They could have done a facially neutral scheme that perhaps exempted a certain contribution rate or a certain benefit payout, but that's not what they did here. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What difference does that make? I mean, let's assume a situation where the State says state employees who are in one of these four plans, and let's further assume that everybody in those four plans receives a lesser benefit or, alternatively, contributes a greater percentage of their salary to the plan. So, you know, it's -- it's -- it's -- the State has just decided, look, this is a convenient way of identifying these people, but, in fact, all the people in these plans have that characteristic, which makes them different from the federal employees, that they contribute more or that they receive less in other benefits. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Because that's still facially discriminatory, Justice Kagan.   If the State had actually done a neutral criterion and set benefit levels, even if no federal employees then qualified, it would give the federal government the opportunity to redo its benefit plan so that they could potentially qualify under the state exemption. Here, there's no such opportunity, so it's still facially discriminatory.   And that's what Section 111 prohibits.   The State could have done a number of things here, but it didn't. The things that the State proffers in its brief as the supposedly distinguishing financial characteristics, the State concedes they have to be applied even-handedly to be able to be legitimate differentiators between tax winners and tax losers. But, if you look at the record, pages JA 28 and 29, the chart there, it makes it abundantly clear that none of these are even-handedly applied even within the state. So there are some plans with higher benefits that are exempted.   Some not.   There are some plans where there's entitlement to Social Security that are exempted.   Some not.   Some higher benefit rates. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I guess my hypothetical was meant to take that off the table. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " To say assuming that that's not true -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- and the State really has categorized precisely as -- as to benefit levels or contribution levels but not in those terms, you're -- you know, not in those terms, and you're saying that in itself is impermissible? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Right, because it's facially discriminatory.   And -- and it doesn't provide any opportunity for any federal employees to ever be part of it.   It would be different if it were done as a facially neutral law. In fact, most facially neutral laws, regardless of whether there are a meaningful number of federal employees who qualify or not, would likely pass scrutiny under Section 111. The first and critical problem here is that this is facially discriminatory. The second problem is what I mentioned, that the line the State drew is based on job duties.   The job duties are identical.   And the financial characteristics the State proffers were not even-handedly applied to the State and plainly weren't involved in the line that the State actually drew. The State also argues that the -- the lower court opinion was correct, notwithstanding Davis, because only a fairly narrow category of State employees are exempted.   But this argument was expressly rejected in Davis, and it can't carry the day here. In Jefferson County, for example, this Court looked at a fairly narrow category, state judges versus federal judges, and only upheld that taxation scheme because the federal judges and state judges were treated the same. And, indeed, that exemption was facially neutral because there were people who got the exemption who were state employees and people who didn't who were state employees, and the same, some federal employees got the exemption and some didn't. The State also argues that there has to be undue interference with the federal government.   But that also has never been the test.   That was rejected in Davis as well. Certainly, if you look at United States versus Mexico in Footnote 11, the Court makes very clear that you could have interference with a government or discrimination, either of which invalidates the scheme under Section 111. Finally, the State argues that we've talked about that you have to compare to the most comparable individual.   We've already mentioned that it really isn't that inquiry. The inquiry is one of similarity.   Is -- is the state retiree or employee similar enough to the federal retiree or employee that there shouldn't be discrimination? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Suppose what -- suppose that the person who's drafting this bill for the state is trying to -- they think that the police officers and the others really -- they aren't paid very much and it's a particularly dangerous job, and you know those characteristics, so -- so they think they should give them a tax break. And then someone says, well, what about the federal marshals, they do the same thing? And then the person replies: Yes, they do, but they get paid a lot more, you see. And so the feds pay them a lot more than we pay the state people.   So that's why we're doing it.   Okay? Is that okay or not? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " It -- it's not for three reasons, Justice Breyer.   First, it's facially discriminatory.   Secondly, the motive itself doesn't matter, as this Court said in Davis.   And, third, the State could always extend that benefit to federal employees. For example, in this case, Section 12(c)(5), which is the broader exemption that only gets a small -- a smaller exemption, was specifically extended to federal employees two weeks after the Davis decision, but the State didn't extend 12(c)(6), and, therefore, it's facially discriminatory. If I could reserve the rest of my time, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with Petitioner that this West Virginia tax exemption here is facially discriminatory.   And that, I think, is the critical feature that really gets to the heart of some of the questions that several Justices have posed this morning. It's instructive, I think, to focus on the difference between the tax that the Court struck down in Davis and Barker and the one that the Court upheld in Jefferson County. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could you just say what you mean by \"facially discriminatory\"? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " Absolutely, Your Honor. A tax is facially discriminatory when it's not open to any federal employees ever, regardless of what job duties they perform or what their benefit level is or what their contribution rate is.

"}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " Well, I -- I think that even when a tax is facially discriminatory, Your Honor, there is going to be a second question, which is, is this particular employee actually suffering discrimination? And I think it gets to one of the questions that you were asking my friend in support of Petitioner, which is there can -- if you imagine, for example, that Mr. Dawson was a federally employed teacher, as opposed to a law enforcement officer, this tax exemption is still facially discriminatory.   But Mr. Dawson in that hypothetical is not himself suffering discrimination.   He's the wrong plaintiff. And I also think that that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So what would -- what precisely would you say would be open on remand? You're -- you're suggesting not reverse but vacate and remand.   Remand so that the West Virginia court could -- could consider what? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " Well, the West Virginia state court never undertook the analysis of whether Mr. Dawson is materially different from the federal employees -- excuse me, from the state employees who benefit from the exemption. Now, if the Court feels like it has all the information it needs, West Virginia has now come forward in its brief and put forward several purported justifications that it thinks can sustain its law, we agree with Petitioner that we don't think that the record bears out any of those. And if the Court thinks it has enough to decide the case, we're comfortable with -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I -- I guess what I don't -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well -- well, it's, I think, related to your point.   Where are you on the dialogue I had with Mr. Rosenberg? Does -- are the benefits that, say, your -- your boss, the Attorney General, receives exempt? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Think carefully before answering. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " The government is much more interested in the courts, lower courts applying the correct legal rule than it is in exactly where a state court draws the line. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I'm sure.   But I'm more interested in how -- how you're going to carry out that division.   In other words, say facially discriminatory, but with respect to what duties, what category of duties? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " Well, again, I think this -- it depends on how the state has drawn the class.   States are entitled to have whatever kind of exemptions they want.   They just have to make them available on equal terms to federal employees.   And that's exactly the structure of this tax in Jefferson County, and it's the reason why the Court upheld the tax in Jefferson County. All federal judges, all state judges were treated alike.   Other persons and other employees, attorneys, were -- were treated alike, whether it was state and federal.   And I think that that means that even if the distinctions that the State is drawing are somewhat arbitrary, that is fine as long as the State is making an effort to afford equivalent treatment to state and federal employees alike. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I guess what I -- I don't understand about -- about what you think ought to be left open on remand is, if you think that the prime evil of this legislation is that it's not facially neutral, that a federal employee can't be a part of these state plans, so could never be treated in the same way, then all the State justifications like these people get fewer benefits, these people pay more in -- in -- in -- make more of a contribution, all of that, do I understand your position correctly, is just irrelevant? The -- you know, the -- the state court could find that these people get less benefits and that these people, the state employees, make a greater contribution, and -- and yet not be able to rule for the State.   Is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " It's not quite correct, Your Honor, in this respect: The critical question is, is this plaintiff suffering discrimination on the basis of source of pay? And so, to return to your hypothetical from the last -- from the last session, if you imagine that it turns out that the State actually has selected only those plans where the employees, say, contribute less than 5 percent to their retirement and it has put in the, you know, disfavored category all employees who contribute more than 5 percent, if Mr. Dawson is in the disfavored class, if it turns out that he lines up with the class of -- of workers that West Virginia is not affording the benefit, he has not suffered discrimination. Now, at the time we wrote the -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " No, but even if he is in the favored class, you're saying he's not -- no, I -- I -- okay, I get it.   I get it. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What if he's -- what if he's equivalent to both the favored and the disfavored class? Then what? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " If -- if there's really no basis at all on which to -- to make a distinction between who the state has selected and -- and who it has disfavored -- now, again, we don't think there are really any cases like that, but in that -- in that sort of unusual situation, I do think Mr. Dawson would be entitled to the exemption. And the reason is that the State would not be able to meet its burden to defend its facially discriminatory law. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Let me try this out. Let me try this out and see if this is close to what you're saying. Where you have a variety of categories of state employees and some get the benefit in question and some don't get the benefit in question, so the first step would be you compare all the categories of -- the relevant categories of state employees and you identify the characteristics that distinguish the employees in the favored class from the -- from the characteristics of those in the disfavored class.   And once you've done that, then you ask whether the federal employees have those characteristics.   That would be step two. But the -- the -- I think even when you do that, you will very -- unless this -- unless the states get to do just about what any -- whatever they want, you will have situations where the federal employees are pretty similar to the ones in the favored class, but they're not identical. And then you've got a judgment call. And I don't quite know how to resolve that. Now is this -- is this right? Is that -- or am I off base with this? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " Your Honor, I think you have it exactly right.   And I understand that there are going to be, in some cases at the margins, difficult questions, where it -- it's hard to apply the test that the Court set out in Davis. We're much more concerned about the states actually undertaking that effort in good faith.   And what we -- the problem that we have with the West Virginia Supreme Court's opinion is that it never even attempted that inquiry. It never attempted to sort out whether these federal employees are more similar to the state employees who get the exemption.

I -- I do think that there's been a concession that the job duties of federal marshals are similar to the exempted class. So what's left? You -- you said something to her that confused me.   I thought you said, if the State had actually differentiated their employees on the basis of the contribution they made or the benefits they received, then the scheme would be okay if the federal marshals didn't -- well, they would never make the contribution, so -- but maybe they have different benefits. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Huston", "text": " Right.   That's what the State has argued, Your Honor.   They attempted to say that the -- the logic of their exemption, although it's facially discriminatory, actually turns on things like contribution rates or whether the employees contribute to Social Security.

If the record supported that, the State could potentially defend its law on this basis.   Now we don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, what -- what could -- what could -- this is going to the exact same thing.

If you're saying, if you're federal, you don't get it, they're going to assume that it's based on something that's -- that's not permissible. I mean, if your -- if that -- if your basis is something else, you ought to say that. You ought to say where -- where, you know, people who have this percentage contributions or whatever, and if the federal employees don't qualify, they don't qualify.

Does that violate the statute? Now I thought the answer to that question is yes, it does violate the statute.   Don't look into the state's actual reasons; just look into whether they end up with less money in their pocket and they're just -- maybe you could say a justification, but the justification can't be, well, we have a set of complicated retirement systems that pays the state people even more.

It makes no sense to me, what you're saying. "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Well, no, Your Honor, because we're not arguing that the Court needs to look at all of the particular details of the plan, but only what -- what is the broadest point of commonality that sweeps in all of those plans that receive the exemption and those who don't.

See", "text": " They did say they were treated the same, and job duties was relevant there because the statute drew distinctions based on individuals who were members of covered professions who did or did not pay other state license fees.   So that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I began to see this as a different issue than I had initially thought.   So don't say I'm right if I'm wrong. Okay? "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " All right. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And if I'm off base, just say it.   But the statute says you cannot tax the pay of a -- or compensation of a federal official if the tax -- unless the tax does not discriminate because of the source of the pay or compensation. "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   So then we have some money that the marshals get.   And they put that money into a federal fund, which is a retirement fund.   And the state in its taxation discriminates against them, but not because of their pay or compensation, but, rather, because of the nature of the retirement fund that they put it in. Is that what you're saying? "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Yes, if the distinction is based on the type of retirement fund, and, again, the only reason that distinction matters is because that's the distinction in the state tax code. And in Phillips Chemical, this Court said that is the line the Court should look at. How has the state drawn the favored class -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's a simple -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So where did I get -- I didn't -- for some reason, it's not necessarily your fault, but I -- this is a fairly simple point. Look at the retirement fund, and if that's the basis for the discrimination against the federal employees, that's fine.   That isn't their pay or compensation. And -- and that's what we should be looking at? "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Your Honor, I would add to that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Yes, but I would add to that. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Then I didn't get that out of the brief too well, but maybe that's my fault.   Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Well, if -- if the distinction is that is a federal retirement plan and that is the reason that someone is or is not in the favored class, then that would be discriminatory under the doctrine. But that's not what this West Virginia tax regime is doing, because the reality is there are many state -- state retirees, over 98 percent, who are in the disfavored class. And there are many state law enforcement officers, some with identical jobs, who are also in the disfavored class. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It seems to me that Davis makes it very clear that that's not a significant consideration.   If you have a small retirement benefit, and say this is available for all people who do X, unless you're paid from a federal plan, would that violate Davis or not? You have 99 percent of the state employees are not eligible for it, but it says if you're in this category, a tiny category, you get the benefit, unless you're a federal retiree. "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Well, Your Honor, the first question would be whether the particular challenger is, in fact, in that tiny category. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, but that first question was not the one I asked.   I asked a different one, which is you argued that, well, it depends on how many of the state employees are eligible or not.   And I thought Davis said specifically it doesn't, it depends upon the source. So if it -- if it's five employees in the state, and there's one who's a federal employee, and your plan says these five get it and no federal employee gets it, does that violate Davis or not? "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Your Honor, in that case, it probably would.   And that's because we're not saying that the sheer small number of employees who would benefit or not matters.   It's relevant, though, because this tax regime treats 98 percent of state employees different from -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, you just said it doesn't matter and then you tell me it matters. "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Well, Your Honor, it matters only because it's indication that the actual dividing line in the state tax code is not state versus federal.   Something else is the dividing line.   Here, the dividing line is the particular plans that they're part of.   And also, if this Court remands on the significant differences standpoint, then the state would be able to show that there are vastly different contribution levels. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " On -- on job duties, if -- if we conclude that that's most significant, were Dawson's job duties similar to the duties of the favored state employees? "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " They were similar, yes, Your Honor, but that does not end the inquiry because they were just as similar to the disfavored state law enforcement employees. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.   And your opposing counsel says in that circumstance where you're similar to both the favored and the disfavored state employees, that the state is required to go with the favored state employees as the treatment for the federal employees, if you're following me.   Why is your opposing counsel wrong on that point? "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Because courts are never required to turn a blind eye to evidence in the record that shows that the comparison class a plaintiff has brought forward is inappropriate. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, why is it inappropriate? That's the point.   They're both appropriate in that circumstance -- "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Because -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- in the sense that they're similarly situated in both the favored and the disfavored.   That's what you just said, I think. "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Right, because it doesn't show what -- what the actual dividing line is in that case.   We know the dividing line is not between those who have certain job duties or not, because a police officer who lives five miles away from another police officer may have vastly different state tax treatment with identical job duties.   That's not how the state tax is drawing the distinction. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But I think the only way to be sure in that circumstance that we're describing that you're not discriminating against the federal employees is to be -- to give them the treatment that the favored state employees get. If you give them the treatment that the disfavored state employees get, you're never going to be sure whether that's based on discrimination against the federal government or not.   And that's what the statute seems to target, making sure that there's not discrimination against the federal employees. "}, {"speaker": "Lindsay S. See", "text": " Your Honor, this Court has never held a most favored taxpayer standard. In fact, in Jefferson County, that was just as true there, because there were many state officers who received the exemption and did not. This Court found that the fact that there were some who were like the federal challengers there in the disfavored class, that was enough to find that similarly-situated taxpayers were, in fact, treated the same.   No matter what other issues may exist for another day, for another federal employee, this one is treated the same. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, LAWRENCE D. ROSENBERG. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " I just have a few points in rebuttal. First of all, in response to the question that Justice Breyer and the Chief Justice posed at the end, this plainly is discrimination based on the source.   If you're in the state plans, you get the exemption.   No federal plans get the exemption.   That is classic discrimination based on source. Secondly, there is no reason for remand.   And I do think that the space between me and my brother from the Solicitor General's Office is actually much smaller than it appears.   What I think the Solicitor General was saying is that there's no question that, at step one of Davis, this is facially discriminatory.   It -- it violates the law. The question is, are U.S. Marshals the right plaintiffs? And before the State had articulated its reasons for arguing that they were, the government said maybe a remand would be appropriate. Here, however, we know what the state has argued.   The state has argued these financial considerations that plainly are not the line that the state drew.   The record itself, the Joint Appendix establishes that the -- the factors that the state argues were not even-handedly drawn. In this circumstance, there is no reason for a remand.   Moreover, many of the financial arguments that the state raised were rejected. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could you slow down? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You've got a lot of generalities.   Give me specifics. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence D. Rosenberg", "text": " Sorry.   Sorry.   Okay. Specifically what I was going to say is, if you talk about the amount of compensation, where the entitlement to Social Security, right, we know that those are not even-handedly applied because we know that some state plans that have higher benefits get the exemption.   Some don't. We know that some entitlement to Social Security gets the exemption.   Some don't.   We know some higher contribution rates get the exemption.   Some don't.   That's Joint Appendix page 28 and 29.   That chart shows that clearly.   Right? So we know that they weren't the basis for the line that the state drew and they're not even-handedly applied. Moreover, many of those arguments were raised in the circuit court, and the circuit court rejected them and said Davis precludes them because they're just ultimately an argument about the amount of compensation. And if the state were going to draw the line based on that, it would have drawn the line neutrally based on the line of compensation, not done it the way it did, which was to discriminate based on source. So none of these are legally relevant, and, therefore, a remand is not appropriate. Third, the burden on the State here is rather light.   Under Davis, all we're asking for is for the states to draw facially-neutral lines, and that is not a difficult burden. There are no state amici in this case supporting West Virginia, and that suggests that nobody's up in arms, other than West Virginia, about the issues here. Finally, with respect to the record, my friend argues about sheriffs and deputy sheriffs, but, if you look at page 17 of our reply brief, we cite the state's brief at page 12, and West Virginia Code Section 7-14D-24. If you were a deputy sheriff or a state trooper, and then became a sheriff, you're still covered. And there's nothing in the record that indicates that most sheriffs weren't previously deputy sheriffs or state troopers.   So the -- the sheriff distinction that the state makes isn't -- isn't supported here.   And the record doesn't justify this notion that counsel mentioned about law-enforcement-only plans. The plans that the State gives the exemption to are law enforcement and firefighter plans.   So it's not a law-enforcement-only plan.   And -- and that particular distinction has never been raised before and simply doesn't matter. Look, at bottom here, in McCulloch versus Maryland, the Court said that, in general, we don't want to be micromanaging all the details of state taxation. Here, the categorical rule of Davis is the right rule.   It -- it prevents facially-discriminatory tax schemes like West Virginia's.   It has a fairly limited inquiry and doesn't burden the states nearly as much. The Court should reverse.   No remand on the merits is necessary. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
