[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 21-984, Helix Energy Solutions Group versus Hewitt. Mr. Clement. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent earned over $200,000 a year and concededly performed executive functions in supervising a dozen or more workers.   He likewise was guaranteed at least $963 in any week in which he worked a minute.   He is thus exempt from the overtime laws under the specialized streamlined exemption for highly compensated workers set forth in Section 601. Respondent nonetheless insists that he's entitled to hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime because his substantial pay was calculated based on a day rate and, in many weeks, his total compensation was much larger than his guaranteed pay and, thus, he flunked the test of Section 604(b) and its reasonable relationship test. But Section 601 incorporates only the salary basis test of Section 602 and not the separate minimum guarantee plus extra rules of Section 604.   Indeed, at the very moment that Section 601 was promulgated, the agency broke apart Section 602 and Section 604. Section 601 has never incorporated this minimum guarantee plus extra rules of Section 604 for very good reason.   Section 601 itself addresses the questions of extras on top of the minimum guarantee and addresses them in terms that are both duplicative of Section 604(a) and contradictory of Section 604(b). In particular, the -- Section 601 authorizes total compensation to dwarf the minimum guarantee in terms that Section 604(b) would deem unreasonable.   Worse still, Section 604 looks unfavorably on compensation in excess of the minimum guarantee, while Section 601 looks at the same thing, compensation in excess of the minimum guarantee, and says that's precisely what makes you highly compensated and, therefore, exempt. Respondent's position would put the -- the regulations on a collision course.   It would ignore the streamlined nature of 601.   And it would divorce the regulations from the statutory text.   The Court should reverse. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mr. Clement, the government says that its starting point is that -- whether or not the -- this is -- you've established that you -- that the Respondent is -- or -- is salaried.   And he argues that he does not receive his compensation on a salary basis. I guess the government's argument is that once you make that determination, you're on an entirely different track from being on a wage basis.   And although your case -- in -- in this case, Respondent makes quite a bit of money, we -- you're suggesting that we can bypass determining whether or not he is on a salary basis. So, one, is being that -- that determination of being on a salary basis a sine qua non of bypassing all of these regs that you're talking about? If not, how do we establish that your highly paid -- why don't we just consider your highly paid Respondent here to simply be a wage earner but a highly paid wage earner? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Thomas, the way I'd respond to that is that Section 601 does not require a worker to be a salaried worker or to get any particular -- sort of like be in general or mostly paid on a salary basis.   It's very specific.   It says the total annual compensation has to include at least $455 a week on a fee or salary basis. So that requires you to look at Section 602, but then, to figure out how much you get on a salary basis, Section 602 doesn't, again, tell you whether you're mostly a salaried worker or a salaried worker in the abstract. It's very specific.   And the test is really, what is the amount that you receive in any week in which you work at least one minute? And for this worker, that was $963 or more, and that $963 was a guarantee.   So, if you work any -- even a minute in a week, you're going to get $963.   That's a predetermined amount.   That satisfies what -- the only requirement vis-\u00e0-vis a salary basis in Section 601, which is that your total annual compensation include at least $455 on a fee or salary basis.   So we can -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Counsel, I -- I don't read the regulation that way.   So can you -- can you help us to understand why you are saying that the amount is the only relevant marker of the applicability of 601? I thought it said that the person's total annual compensation must include at least $455 per week paid on a salary or fee basis. And then we have a separate regulation, 602, which I thought at the beginning you conceded applied.   I -- I -- maybe I misheard you, but I thought you said that 601 incorporated 602's salary basis test.   Am I right about that? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " You're right about that, Justice Jackson. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All right.   And so salary basis, I think, then becomes the question.   And what it means to be on a salary basis under 602 is not just some sort of minimum level of compensation.   In fact, the $455, I think, doesn't even appear in that section.   In fact, when it talks about what it means to be paid on a salary basis, it appears to be looking at the predictability and the regularity of the payment, not the amount. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So -- but -- but the predictability it's looking for is the -- is the guaranteed amount that you know you'll get paid at a minimum if you work a minute in a week. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " No.   I don't think so.   And let me tell you why.   Isn't the predictability that they're talking about and the regularity that they're talking about the total amount that you make in a week? So that, for example, a salaried employee is one who you could conceive of as being eligible for direct deposit, that it's someone who knows at the end of every week the predetermined amount that they're going to make. Whereas Mr. Hew -- whatever his name is -- not Hewitt -- what's your -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " It is Hewitt. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Hewitt, okay. Whereas Mr. Hewitt, at the end of the week, doesn't know.   One week, it could be the minimum amount because he worked a minute.   Another week, it could be much more than that because he worked more than a minute.   Why is that not the way we should think about salary basis given this regulation? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Because, with all due respect, the regulation is quite specific that there's a difference between salary, which is a concept, and compensation.   And 602 itself is absolutely specific that the -- that the salary can be all or part of the employee's compensation. So this is, with all due respect, not a provision that's trying to say we want a -- a steady stream of your top-line income over the course of the year.   What it's concerned about is your bottom-line inquiry, your bottom-line income.   So it -- all it asks you is, if you work a minute, what are you guaranteed to get that week? And if that amount is over 455, then -- which -- and -- and I -- and I grant you, 602 itself doesn't tell you the level, but that comes right from 601. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Your -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And 601 tells you that what you're looking for is not whether the employee gets most of his or her compensation on a salary basis or the lion's share of his or her compensation on a salaried basis.   It's asking you a single question, does the total annual compensation include at least $455 on a salary basis? And the answer for Respondent is yes because every week in which he worked he knew at the beginning of the week that he was going to get at least $963. And, with all due respect, the regulation doesn't ask for stability above that. And to the extent -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Your -- your point is the two words \"or part\" in 602.   If it said constituting all of the employee's compensation, then you would -- that would be different? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Absolutely, Justice Kavanaugh. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But \"or\" -- \"or part\" is critical to your 602 argument? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " It is critical, but it doesn't stand alone, of course, because 601 itself draws the distinction between compensation, total annual compensation, and only $455 a week has to be paid on a salary basis.   And that's very important because, if you multiply 455 by 52, that gets you a number less than $24,000. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Well, why doesn't that \"or part\" reference other things that could be added? I mean, we have this other concept happening in the regulation about, you know, your sort of predetermined amount, that would be your salary, plus other bonuses and things that are coming in. I just don't understand why \"or part\" eviscerates the sort of common-sense understanding of the distinction between salaried workers being those who have the -- a steady stream of predetermined amounts week to week versus daily workers or shift workers or hourly workers, whose weekly amounts can vary dramatically. And I think that's what -- the Department of Labor cared not only about the minimum amount I would think in this EAP regulation, the way it's set up, but also about this predictability, because you -- 455 is a -- is -- is not a very high number in terms of people who would be exempted.   So it seemed to me from the way that this is constructed what they're trying to do is make sure that there's a steady stream of income coming in no matter how much you work for this category of workers. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I -- let me say this. I think that might be one of the purposes behind 604(b), but it's not one of the purposes behind 602, and it is demonstrably not the purpose behind 601 because, under 601, you're right, $455 a week guaranteed isn't that much.   It's $24,000 a year.   So the prototypical worker who qualifies under the high compensation exemption under 601 is going to make three-quarters more than that or more. And all of that, as the regulation provides, can be additional non-discretionary income.   So they are decidedly not concerned under 601 about the highly paid workers for evening it out over the year. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But what about 600? 600 has the same 455 level.   So you -- you're now suggesting that 601 is distinguishing highly compensated at the 455 level, but I see that in 600, which is not in the highly compensated.   So it seems to me they weren't making a distinction about the minimum amount. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I -- I -- they were making a distinction about it for 601 purposes.   And 601 doesn't incorporate just 600. It's got its own language.   It's slightly different.   I'm not going to make a big deal out of the difference, but 600 says that the person's salary is -- is -- their compensation is they're compensated on a salary basis, where 601 simply says it includes $455 a week paid on a salary basis. But what's so significant about 601 and sets it apart is that the prototypical worker who is covered by the exemption is making $100,000 or more.   Yet all the regulators cared about is that the base be $24,000. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Clement, salary basis.   I think of salary basis as, what am I paid for the week? I think of fee, what am I given as an amount? I think of hourly or shift in their ordinary meaning.   What am I paid for the hour? What am I paid for the day? Your reading of this takes out basis completely.   You're -- you're thinking that if I work an hour and get the minimum, that's my salary.   But I read 602 and it says, \"receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.\" So you're requiring a hour of work or a minute of work, but that's not what the regulation says.   The regulation says what are you paying me for the week. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, what it's saying is that it's a predetermined amount that can't be subject, as you say, to reductions for the quality or the quantity of the work.   And that perfectly describes the $963 that this worker was guaranteed in a week. Now he could make more on top of that, but that's not the concern of this regulation. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how do we -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " That's additional compensation. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What do we do with the second part of -- purpose of 602, which is to ensure -- I thought the reason for 602 was to ensure that an employee who wanted to take a Friday afternoon off wouldn't be penalized or wanted to do something else or didn't want to start on Monday but on whatever day they wanted to start. These employees don't have that discretion.   They're not paid for any hour they take off.   They're not paid for any part of a day they miss.   So how does that fit the question of a salary basis? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Again -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Or how does that fit the definition of a salary basis? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- I -- I think -- with -- with all due respect, I think the problem is that -- that -- that 601 doesn't ask is this employee primarily paid on a salary basis.   It doesn't ask whether they can take a day off and how it will affect their pay. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But you tell -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " It asks -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- you told me 601 says you have to fit 602, that 602 is incorporated. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " But -- but only for a very limited purpose, which is to figure out whether total annual compensation includes at least $455 a week paid on a salary basis.   And then, if you go through 602, 602 does not address the concern that your salary -- your guaranteed amount is too low vis-\u00e0-vis your total compensation.   That's addressed if at all only in 604. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And so what you're asking us to do is take an hourly wage earner and take them out of 604 -- and take them out of 604, which is the only provision that deals with someone who's not paid on a salary basis. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, with -- with respect, I'm not asking you to do anything in particular with an hourly worker.   The -- the -- the people who our position will affect -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " This -- this guy is an hourly worker. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, he's a daily worker. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Daily or hourly -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And -- and -- and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- but he's not -- he's not a weekly worker. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " His pay -- his pay -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Meaning only if he decides to stay that way. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- his pay is calculated on a daily basis, but our position affects two classes of people just to be clear.   There's a class of people, and Respondent is prototypical, who have a day rate that's above the weekly minimum that's specified in 601. There's another group of worker that's really the second half of the circuit split, and this is the Anani case from the Second Circuit and the Litz case from the First Circuit, and these are individuals whose pay is calculated on an hourly basis, but they're given a minimum guarantee on top of that, a thousand dollars, $2,000, whatever it is. And I think, if you go through the regulation and look at what 602 requires, you would see that whether it's a person whose daily rate is above the weekly minimum or somebody who gets that kind of weekly guarantee, they satisfy the terms of 602. Again, 602 doesn't say are you generally paid in a salary basis.   It has a definition of salary basis that allows you to answer the question that's relevant under 601 -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Which is the -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- how much -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- except -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So I'm not sure I get it, Mr. Clement.   So 601 sends you to 602 because 602 tells you what salary basis means. That's -- we can all agree on. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Okay.   But can I -- can I just stop you to say -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Not really. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- but it's sent -- okay. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So what does salary basis mean according to 602? And 602 is a clunker of a sentence, right, so you have to, you know, read it pretty carefully, but there's this language here which says on a weekly or less frequent basis. And the question is, you know, should we understand it the way I think Justice Sotomayor was understanding it is, is the predetermined amount calculated on a weekly or less frequent basis? In which case he doesn't get it because -- because his pay is calculated on a daily basis. Or does it mean something else? And, if so, what else does -- could it mean given this language that's right here in Section 602 starting us off that the predetermined amount should be on a weekly or less frequent basis? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Kagan, it -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the West -- the -- the sort of frequency of the basis or week or -- is not modifying \"calculation,\" which is not a word that appears in 602 at all.   It's modifying the word \"received,\" which happens to dovetail perfectly with the word in 601, which is paid on a salary basis. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yeah, so I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And so what -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- that that's what this depends on, is -- is what is the weekly basis modifying.   Is it modifying the predetermined amount or is it modifying the receipt? That seems right to me. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, can -- can -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and, you know, this is a clunker of a sentence, but I would think, given all the different ways that this regulation uses the idea of weekly basis, daily basis, you know, et cetera, et cetera, hourly basis, et cetera, et cetera, that what this regulation is talking about is how is your pay calculated. Is it calculated on a daily basis? In which case you can still be exempted because you can go to 604 and be exempted.   But you don't fit under Section 604. So, if -- if a daily basis, you can be exempted under Section 604.   602 says here's the -- here's -- it's an exemption for people whose pay is on a weekly basis, and you don't fit that either because Mr. Hewitt's pay is not on a weekly basis.   So you're out of 602.   You're out of 604.   You're out. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So a funny thing happens when you go to 604, though, which is it has this phrase \"may be computed on an hourly ... daily or a shift basis.\" And so I think, if you just look at 602 alone, \"received\" means \"received\" and not \"calculated\" or \"computed.\" But I think that inference is strongly supported -- this is not an agency that didn't know how to use the words \"computed\" or \"calculated.\" They used that in 604.   So I don't think it's a fight between whether \"on a weekly basis\" modifies \"predetermined amount\" or \"received.\" It's really their position requires you to stick an entirely different word in the sentence, which is \"calculated.\" "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " How often did he receive pay? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " He received pay on a biweekly basis, so every other week.   And in -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And -- and in that biweekly, how much was he -- what was the minimum he would receive? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " He knew he would receive -- if he worked two weeks during that period, he knew he would receive at least $963 times two. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yeah, 1926. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And if he only worked one, he'd know he'd receive 963.   And the regulation is explicit, which I think also underscores that it's not a stability regulation.   The regulation is explicit, if you don't work a minute in a week, it's fine for you to get nothing. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If you tell a client, Mr. Clement, that he has to pay you on an hourly basis, are you -- is -- are you referring to your hourly billable rate, or are you saying that the client has to give you a check every hour?

Clement", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I -- I -- I would probably mean that he needs to ultimately pay me, but if I tell him I need -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.

It has something to do with, in the end, when he pays you, every two weeks, every month, every year, it's going to be on an hourly basis. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Not if I -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That's exactly what this regulation says. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " If -- if -- if I'm providing legal services to somebody who I think is on the verge of bankruptcy, I might well tell them, look, I need to receive the -- the money at -- every day.   So I think the key word is \"receive.\" "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, you might tell them that, but then you would say considerably more. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " No, no.   I would say the word -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You would not just say -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- I would use the word \"receive.\" "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- pay me on an hourly basis. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I would -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You would say, really, I mean that you have to give me a check on an hourly basis.   And if you don't say that, everybody knows that an hourly basis means you're getting paid X dollars, you fill in the blank, you know, per hour. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I respectfully disagree.   I think you're -- you're -- you're giving insufficient weight to the word \"receive.\" If I tell the client I need to receive on an hourly basis $600, boy, I think -- I mean, I'm probably not going to get that client because that's a pretty, you know, tough demand.   But I think, if I use the word \"receive,\" I'm making clear I need to receive it. And, again, this dovetails perfectly with 601 because 601 says paid on -- on -- on a weekly or fee -- rather, on a salary or fee basis.   So, from the perspective of the employer, it's what you pay.   From the inspective -- perspective of the employee, it's what you receive. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Mr. Clement, can I ask you about the relationship between 601 and the rest of the EAP exemption regulation? Your question presented suggests that it's \"standalone\" and you use that term. And I was a little concerned about it because, when I look at the structure of the entire regulation, when you start at the beginning, at its title, it says this is \"defining and delimiting the exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, computer and outside sales employees.\" It doesn't say highly compensated employees. When you look at the subparts of the regulation, they have a subpart for executive, a subpart for administrative, a subpart for professional, a subpart for computer.   There's no subpart for highly compensated. And the government says highly compensated is actually just a subset of these other categories.   It is the fact that, you know, a person who is in each of these other categories, with the exception of computers, has to be paid on a salary basis.   And some of those people are going to be making much more than the $455 minimum.   Those are the ones we'll call highly compensated for the purpose of 601 and allow them to have this shortcut through. So can you talk a little bit about why it is -- first of all, does Mr. Hewitt satisfy any of the other parts of this regulation? You -- you hone right in on 601.   And what is -- how are we to understand that this is really about the kind of employee who, in my view, would have the regularity and predictability of a salary versus what some people have called the kind of \"eat what you kill\" dynamic, that you only get paid when you work and not a dollar more? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Jackson, I think -- first of all, I think you're right to say that the highly compensated workers' exemptions is one way to qualify for the statutory exemption for executive, administrative, and professional employees, and you know that from the structure of the statute. I mean, you know, ultimately, there's a statutory exemption, but there is pretty clearly from the regulations two different ways to qualify for the statutory EAP exemption.   One way is to do it through the executive exemption, the administrative exemption, and the professional exemption, which is 551.100, 551.200, 551.300. But there is an alternative way to qualify for the EAP exemption under the statute, and that is Section 601, and it is the thing that is streamlined and different. Now we know that from the text of the regulation itself, which talks about being exempt under this -- under this section. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And we know it from that very -- if you go back to the very beginning, 551.0, when it explains how this whole thing works, it goes through the various subparts, and then it describes subpart G, which is about salary, and it says that generally tells you what the salary requirements are, but then it also provides an exemption for highly compensated workers. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Okay.   But let me -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I have -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- I have two questions.   Would you answer the argument on the other side that the interpretation that you are offering us would have very deleterious effects on lower-compensated workers? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I don't think this would have any deleterious effects on lower-compensated workers at all. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Your -- your interpretation of 602? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Yeah.   It would not have any negative effects on lower-compensated workers because, if you're a lower-compensated worker, you would still have to satisfy 604. And our -- our principal argument, really the question presented here, is that if you're a highly compensated employee, all you have to satisfy is 602 and you don't have to go to 604. So there's no effect here, really, on lower-compensated workers at all.   They still have to comply with Section 604.   And -- and -- and I think, to the contrary, the problem with the government's position here is, in their own reg, in 601(c), it says that high compensation is a strong indicator of exempt status.   But the government seems to forget about that. But the point is, I mean, if you look at 604(b), it's -- it's a somewhat puzzling provision because it's a provision that says that we don't want you to make too much money in addition to your minimum guarantee.   So, if you're guaranteed by salary $24,000 a year, if you make up to 12,000 in extra, that's okay. But, if you can make $24,000 in extra, that's not okay. And that's puzzling enough on its face to me because I personally prefer to make the extra 24 instead of the extra 12, but -- but I guess what they're concerned about there is there may be some misclassification with lower-compensated workers and so they need to police that.

But if there's one thing I thought that the regs were pretty clear about is that all the total annual compensation had to include was $455 per week paid on a salary basis, not $4,000 paid on a salary basis.

But, at bottom, this case is a statutory case and our very first answer -- this is Joint Appendix page 33 -- we said he's exempt under the statute.

So, at the end of the day, I think you always want to look back and see, is our -- is our interpretation better and more consonant with the statute than theirs? And the answer is absolutely because we're using sort of salary as a way to screen people in to the exemption who are otherwise concededly executives, which is all the statute requires.

And that's been a recurring consideration in this Court's cases, I mean, Christopher, Integrity Staffing, the whole line of this Court's cases.   And it's one thing -- I mean, if the -- if -- if the government had clearly articulated this position, you know, A, it probably would have been challenged on statutory grounds immediately, but, B, the industry could say okay. I mean, some of this is kind of perverse because one of the things you can do is convert them all to hourly, which isn't going to make them feel like they're really executive, administrative, you know, professionals.   I mean, they're probably happier the way it was. But, in all events, the notice point is hugely important, and it's particularly important with respect to the highly compensated employees because, if you're talking about a universe of people that are getting paid over $100,000, if there was a foot fault on the overtime calculations, the amount of liability is going to be huge, whereas, if you're talking about the people that the statute really cares about, the people who are only making 35- or $40,000, if you blow the overtime calculation for them, the amount of damages is going to be much smaller.   So it would really be perverse here. And I think, you know, obviously, this was a -- a factor in this Court's Christopher decision, when the people were making -- the sales reps were making $70,000 a year.

"}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well, it was my understanding that the point of the regs -- and, you know, the statutory question is not before us, but that the Secretary of Labor was permitted by the terms of the statute to define what it means to be an EAP in a bona fide way so that employees -- employers don't manipulate job descriptions to evade the requirements of the Act, right? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, and that does bring us back to the regulatory question because, boy, is that not a concern for people that are getting paid $100,000 and more.   And why do we know that? Don't take my word for it. Look right at the regulation.   It says high compensation is a strong indicator of exempt status. So, I -- I mean, you know, if you think about it, like one way to think about the question here is what's better -- for workers that are being paid $100,000 or more, what's a better indicator that they're a bona fide executive? The fact that they're being paid $100,000 or more or the fact that their minimum guarantee is no more than two-thirds of their total compensation? "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well, I agree with you the result was counterintuitive here, but the -- Labor didn't exempt altogether highly compensated employees. And I guess, at the regulatory point, the -- the -- the thing that the -- that I have trouble getting past is, in 604(b), you know, putting aside 602, 604(b) refers specifically to employees' earnings being computed on an hourly, daily, or shift basis, saying no, no, no, they can still be paid; that doesn't defeat their, you know, payment on a salary basis.   So it's kind of like a specific controlling the general here.   This -- this specifically refers to how your client's pay was computed. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " But -- but a couple of points on that.   I mean, another way to look at this, the specific thing controls the general, is whether you're paid more than $100,000.   So I don't think you can decide this case on the specific controls the general. And then, if you're trying to break the tie, which specific is sort of more specific or more persuasive here, then you look to the other factors, which is the statute expressly incorporates 602 but not -- not 604. 602 is labeled Salary Basis.   604 is labeled Minimum Guarantee Plus Extra.   That's really important because Section 601 itself doesn't address salary basis independently.   It does it by cross-reference.   But it does address the issue of minimum guarantee plus extra.   And it duplicates 604(a) because it says minimum guarantee plus extra, hunky-dory, and then it's contradictory to 604(b) because 60 -- 601 says your total compensation can totally dwarf your guaranteed compensation.   You can get $175,000 in other compensation as long as you're -- you get just 455 a week. So they don't care at all about the reasonable relationship.   They bless an unreasonable relationship.   So that's why it seems to me such a strong inference that Section 601 incorporates 602 but not 604 -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- which is the question presented. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Jackson? "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Yes.   So, Mr. Clement, I've heard you say several times in various ways that you think the regulatory scheme is about ensuring a minimum amount and not the weekly guarantee, sort of hand waving the idea of weekly guarantee.   And I want to posit something quickly and then ask you about a hypo. I want to posit that 602 and the salary basis is actually parallel to 604 in that they're both ensuring the minimum weekly amount. Under 602, you get it in the form of a salary, predetermined, coming to you no matter how much you work. Under 604, if your setup is not that, if you're not set up predetermined amount coming in weekly, the regulation guarantees that you still have this minimum weekly amount through 604, all right? That's how I see it. And let me tell you why I think it matters, because the regularity of a predetermined amount is how people pay mortgages.   So I don't know or it -- it doesn't really matter that he might get $100,000 over the course of the year.   What he has to know is how much is coming in at a regular clip so that he can get a babysitter, so that he can hire a nanny, so that he can pay his mortgage.   It's about, I think, the predictability and the regularity of payment. So let me ask you this hypothetical. We have a nurse who has -- does the covered functions and makes $455 for a 12-hour shift. That's about 38 -- eight dollars an hour.   Some weeks, this nurse is called in for one shift and makes the $455.   Some weeks, he's called in for four shifts and makes $1820.   He doesn't know -- because of the way his situation is set up, he doesn't know from week to week how much he's going to make.   It just depends on how many shifts his supervisor asks him to work, and all that's guaranteed is at least one shift, right, for the predetermined amount of 40 -- $455.   So some weeks, he makes that.   Some weeks, he makes more.   But, if he doesn't work any shift, he doesn't get anything. I think that under your theory as you've articulated it, he would be a salary basis worker and would not be entitled to overtime for the weeks that he makes the -- does the four or five shifts.   Am I right about that in terms of how you have set this up? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I -- I -- I think you're basically right, but could I just add a couple of thoughts to that?

But the -- but it's very clear that 601 for the highly compensated workers doesn't care about the variability of your total annual compensation. And one of the reasons is the catch-up payment.   It says you can have a catch-up payment, it can be a huge catch-up payment at the end of the year.   And it creates sort of a safe harbor. So somebody that, you know, they thought was going to make $100,000, but they had a bad year, they're only making $50,000, they can have a big payment at the end of the year. That's not consistent with a concern about stability on the top line.   It is still consistent that you get at least $455 every week paid on a salary basis. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sullivan. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin Sullivan", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For over 80 years, the FLSA has made two things clear: One, a bona fide executive must be paid on a salary basis, and, two, a pure daily rate employee is not paid on a salary basis. The highly compensated employee regulation requires payment on a salary basis. There's only two ways to get there under the regulatory scheme.   The first is Rule 602, the general rule, and the second is a special rule for workers who are paid on a hourly, daily, or shift basis.   There are a number of textual historical reasons why the -- why Helix is unable to meet the FLSA's general rule. You can look at the first two sentences as fantastic.   There has to be an amount earned.   That amount earned has to be a predetermined amount.   That predetermined amount has to be fixed on a basis in time and it is, under the regulation, a weekly or less frequent basis. Mr. Hewitt was paid on a daily basis. Mr. Clement, my friend, just said that he was paid on a daily basis.   It's conceded at the Joint Appendix 113.   Daily basis is more frequent than weekly basis. The next sentence of 602(a) says that the full salary has to be paid without regard to the days worked.   Mr. Hewitt was paid with regard to the days worked.   And there are several other reasons throughout the text. Now, even though Helix cannot meet the general rule under 602, the Department of Labor provided a special rule under 604(b) for hourly, daily, or shift employees.   Maybe they can meet the salary basis. But Helix concedes they can't satisfy that section.   They disclaim that they should even be of use to this section, which was made to help employers.   That concession is telling because it's meant to avoid sham salaries. I welcome the Court's questions.

There's a reason that it's not just a concession on duties.   Yes, I conceded that Mr. Hewitt otherwise -- or that Helix could otherwise satisfy the duties test.

For example, a salaried employee might get a bonus at the end of the year.   A salaried employee might get a commission.   And so what the Department of Labor said is there are instances over and above the minimum guarantee that an employee may earn that's all or part of the compensation. That doesn't destroy the salary basis. But, if we're talking about time worked within the work week, within the normal work week, that is not -- sorry, that's based on time.

The difference is that when someone is not a salaried worker, they have to work each hour or each day to get the payment.   And I know it's a minimum amount, says Mr. Clement, that he gets for each day that he works, but he still has to actually work it.   He can't take the afternoon off. That's the difference between the executive-characterized person and the person who would otherwise be a daily worker, even if that daily worker makes a very high amount. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin Sullivan", "text": " That is correct.   An executive is given latitude to their time that the daily wage worker is not given. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

But they're not going to be able to do that if that means that you can't work that day. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   No, I -- I understand that.   I mean, as fascinating as this microscopic examination of the particular terms of these particular regulations are, I am also concerned about two other things, and they -- they may cut in different directions. One is the -- one is the effect of this on lower-income workers, not people who are making $200,000 a year, and the second is how you think the -- the energy industry should structure the pay of these people who work out on oil rigs in order to comply with your understanding of the regulations. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin Sullivan", "text": " The first question was how does this impact lower workers and the right frame.   It certainly is not Helix's argument, because if a paycheck that's over some minimum equals a salary, that means every hourly, daily, piecework employee is lost under Rule 602, and they now might be a salaried employee, which -- which means that the company will argue if they have the duties and the rest, but it ruins the salary protection -- salary basis test for lower-income workers. But another reason, if you at a company make a minimum guarantee and pay them the rest and you call that a salary, well, you're only giving salary protections against the deductions to the minimum but not to the rest.   Like, if there's jury duty, if Mr. Hew -- if Mr. Hewitt had a five-day work week and the first day is only guaranteed and the rest of the week he had to go to jury duty, it means the company can't -- the company is just perfectly allowed to deduct because they're going to say it's the minimum that's protected, not the rest. Mr. Clement answered that -- my friend answered that question maybe so. With -- with respect to Your Honor's second question about the oil industry, first, yes, there are methods of complying.   I'm primarily a management lawyer.   There is multiple ways that they could have been within the regulations.   They chose not to do so. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What are those ways? Something like what the government outlined at the end of its brief? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin Sullivan", "text": " Certainly.   I mean, yes.   They -- they could pay him an hourly wage if they wanted to with overtime.   They could, as the government said in the last page of their brief, issue a guarantee.   The Fifth Circuit said 4,000.   The government said 4,600. But the point of that is to approximate that the compensation received by Mr. Hewitt would have approximated, would have been something close to a salary, as opposed to what it actually was, what we all actually know what it was, a day rate, paid by the day, which is not a salary.   Under the statute, under the regulations, under any compensation scheme, that's not what we have here. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.   On 602, just -- sorry to go back to it, belabor it. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin Sullivan", "text": " Judge -- Justice. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

So then my question is the reference to predetermined amount must be a predetermined minimum because you're not going to know going paycheck to paycheck how much you're going to have in extra commissions, correct?

So, on 604, which is the question we granted on, Mr. Clement says the specific should control the general and that 601 is a specific reference to how highly compensated employees should be considered, and this blends into Justice Thomas's question as well. Why isn't that correct, that you look at 601 as a self-contained piece for highly compensated employees, cross-reference to 602, but in context, does not pick up the 604 and, in fact, might not make sense with 604 given the catch-up payments could be $70,000 or what have you.

On the reasonable relationship in 604, this is the part that I think is most inconsistent, that if you can have a catch-up payment at the end of the year, which is explicitly authorized by 601, that's never going to be a -- a reasonable relationship, a large catch-up payment. So then what is -- that makes 601 seem incoherent.   And the answer to that is that 601 should not be read together with 604.   I think that's the argument on the catch-up payment to show that reasonable relationship can't possibly apply to highly compensated employees.

I'd like you to think about it in a different way, the -- the way that it was intended.   Under Rule 601, total annual compensation discusses what are the types of compensation an employee who earns a lot of money can be counted towards this salary level test of $100,000 or $107,000.   But the person still has to be paid on a salary basis. Rule 604 is -- are -- is -- you know, Rule 604 is not addressing that.   Rule 604 is addressing the principle who is paid on a salary basis. 601 assumes they're paid on a salary basis, requires it.

Under 602's general rule, that means the employee must receive payment on a weekly or less frequent basis, that is, next sentence, the full salary for a week has to be provided without regard to the number of days or hours worked.

Yang", "text": " The answer is yes because they're not a bona fide executive.   And -- and let me explain why.   Let me -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " What were they the first year? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " Oh, no, in the first year, if you get a $200,000 true salary, like you're get -- they split 200,000 into 52 and you get that every week regardless of how much you work that week, that's a salary. But the -- the reason why that we look at this not -- right here, we -- we're looking back on a case, right, but the employee has to look forward.   The employee at beginning of the week doesn't know if you're paid on a daily basis how much you're going to be paid. But, if you're a salaried employee, where your compensation is on a weekly or less frequent basis, you know you're going to get X amount for a week. That's why they talk about -- the regulation, 602(a), talks about a predetermined amount.   You -- you have to know in advance what is the predetermined amount for the week. And the next sentence is critical.   It talks about, therefore, the -- the full salary has to be provided without regard to the number of days or hours worked.   That means for the week you get this chunk. Now our -- my friend says you can just get a guarantee, right, that exceeds $455 and that's your salary.   So that's analogous to saying, look, on day one, I'm going to pay you $100.   On day two -- I'm going to call that your salary, your weekly salary.   On day two, I give you another $100, and it goes through the week. No one would say that that's a salary. You're paid a daily wage because your weekly salary is what you get for your work during the week. 602(b)(6), this is on page 3a or, excuse me, 6a of the government's brief.   It provides a special rule for the first and last week that an employee works, and it says there you can pay the proportionate amount of the full salary for the first and last week. But then the sense -- second sentence is important.   It says: However, you're not paid on a salary basis within the meaning of the regulations if you're employed occasionally for a few days and you only get a proportionate amount of the weekly salary.   That just reinforces you get a few days' salary.   It's not a weekly salary.   Since -- Then you look at 604(b), this is on the following -- 604(a), on the following page. The reason, Justice Kavanaugh, that it says your comp -- your salary is all or part of your compensation is because compensation can include more than salary.   Compensation can include bonuses, that type of thing. But, importantly, this is the last, the third category here, this is on page 7a, the additional compensation that is beyond the salary can include compensation based on hours worked for work beyond the normal work week. So, for instance, if you get -- you can get paid if you normally work 40 hours a week, you know, for hours 40 to 50.   But the first 40, that is your week -- that has to be a weekly salary.

And then it gave the power to the Department of Labor not only to define that term but to delimit the term.   That's broad authority that the Court's already recognized as broad authority. And when they did look at what constitutes an executive, one of the critical things -- this was -- this is almost unanimously -- almost universally agreed in all contexts -- that they're paid on a salary basis. Why? Why is -- is executive paid on a salary basis? Because it reflects the autonomy and discretion that the executive has to manage his or her own time.   That -- the employer vests that discretion -- it's not like you have to show up on Monday and I'll give you a thousand dollars.   You're paid for the general value of the time.

The -- at 2a of the government's brief, this is the highly compensated exemption. And if you just pair it on page 1a, that's the executive exemption. The executive exemption requires three things.   You have to be paid $455 a week on a salary basis, the first two requirements.   And then there are three duties tests you have to meet.   Three -- you have to meet all of them. Look at 601.   601(b)(1) says, with respect to the total compensation, it must include at least $455 a week on a salary or fee basis.   That parallels exactly the general requirement for the executive.   All it says is you have to meet that part of the executive. The difference for the highly compensated employee is that you can get a relaxed duties test.   Instead of meeting all three of the requirements, you can meet just one duties requirement.   But that comes only if your total compensation, which has to include your salary, but it can include these other things, right, exceeds $100,000.

"}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- is authorized by 601.   And they say -- and I just want your answer to this -- that that can't be consistent with 604 because that requires a reasonable relationship between the guaranteed amount, which we agreed was 30, and the amount actually earned, which we agreed was more than 100.

And then, if you go further on, it says, no, no, this does not apply to things like bonuses, that really reasonable relationship. And the reason why that exists is because, if you're paid on a daily basis, you're not really receiving anything that is like a salary unless that guarantee is basically what you would get as a weekly salary. And so the reasonable relationship test is, look, what would you get normally for the full week? And if you have a guarantee that has a reasonable relationship test -- to that, that's going to function as a salary.   But that's a different question.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan, anything further? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson? Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Clement? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Just a few points in rebuttal. The -- it is conceded here that the Respondent makes over $200,000 a year and is guaranteed to receive at least $963 in each week in which he works.   Yet their position is that he receives zero in salary, not a penny. Now we would say the far more logical reading of what 602 actually says is to say he receives at least $963 in salary every week in which he works.   And then you compare that to the statutory -- or rather the regulatory test, it -- total compensation has to include $455 per week, paid on a salary basis.   He satisfies it. The contrary view requires you to say that this person gets no salary at all, which defies reality and common sense.   And it doesn't make any difference that this is a day rate because what matters is the day rate's above the weekly minimum. We can easily say, okay, you make 90 -- $963 if you work a day, even a minute, and we give you a weekly guarantee of $963.   It would be redundant.   Anytime somebody is paid a day rate that's above the weekly minimum, they satisfy the terms of 602. Second point I want to make is I thought it was very revealing that my friends on the other side really couldn't answer the question about what 602 means, particularly with respect to \"receives\" and \"all or part\" without directing you to 604.   But the problem with that is twofold.   One is, if you get to 602, it uses \"calculates,\" rather \"computes,\" rather than \"receives.\" So the regulators knew how to use those differently. The second problem, though, and I think this is very telling, is if you start to hear what their theory is, they say, well, for 602, you can get commissions and things like that, but if it's pay for time worked, then you have to figure out what the normal work week is, or if you get to 604(b), you have to figure out what the person's scheduled normal work week is. And this is all in the context of 601 that's supposed to be a streamlined, easy-to-administer exemption that captures the common-sense instinct that somebody's getting six figures is very, very likely to be exempt. Now there's no threat to lower-income workers here.   And I want to be clear about this.   Just because 602 allows you to figure out that somebody's made a certain -- paid a certain amount on a salary basis, if they don't qualify for the HCE 601 exemption, then you still have to go to 604(b) and you still have to satisfy that, and that -- that protects the lower-income workers. This is all about 601 and its interaction with 604, and, with respect to those two provisions, 604 is duplicative and contradictory.   And this I want to reinforce as well, that 601 is absolutely a stand-alone exemption.   You get that from the text of the statute -- of the regulation, which says you can be exempt under this section, but you also get it from the fact that it's got that subsection (d) that's entirely duplicative of 541.3, and you also get it from the fact that in the regulatory history, excuse me, they had to add the 455 per week paid on a salary basis after the proposed regulation. They wouldn't have needed to do that if 601 automatically picked up 600, which has the 455 for every executive employee, so further evidence that 601 operates independently as a stand-alone exemption and it's supposed to be streamlined. On the carveouts -- with respect, the carveouts for special workers aren't carveouts just for the special workers over $100,000.   So we're not asking for a carveout for the whole industry.   We're just asking for a sensible rule that says that when somebody concededly does executive functions and is paid six figures that that person is, as the regulatory language says, strongly likely to be an exempt person, the detailed inquiry into both salary details and into duties is not worth the candle. And the last thing I'll leave you with is just the thought that if you listen to the other side, everything they're talking about is like does he get a true salary, but the question under the statute at the end of the day is, is he truly a bona fide executive.   And that's all but conceded in this case.   And our view of the regulation allows it to coexist with the statute.   Their view of the regulation completely divorces it from the statutory text.
