[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 13-7451, Yates v. United States.   Mr. Badalamenti. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The natural, sensible and contextual reading of Section 1519 is that the phrase \u201c record document or tangible object \u201d is confined to records, documents and devices designed to preserve information, the very matters involved in the Enron debacle.   Given the expansive Federal nexus of this statute, which is the intent to influence the proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of the United States, it is implausible that Congress would have passed sub silentio, an all-encompassing obstruction statute buried within the altering documents provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   A strong textual indicator that Section 1519 is confined to record-related offenses is the inclusion of the unique term \u201c makes false entry in \u201d, which Congress only uses in record-related statutes.   The canons of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis confirm that tangible object is related to the common thread between record and document which are information devices -- information mediums. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Why should -- why should the expression \u201c tangible object \u201d, which stands alone, it's not falsifying documents, why should the word \u201c object \u201d in 1519 be treated differently than the word \u201c other object \u201d in 1512 -- 1512(c)? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, in Section 1519 -- it was passed at the same time as 1512(c) as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   And as this Court held in Russello, when Congress includes different terms in different statutes passed in the same act, it is intended to mean something different. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So you think there's a difference between \u201c tangible object \u201d and \u201c other object \u201d? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Yes, there is.   The first reason is that the inclusion of \u201c makes false entry in \u201d indicates that the phrase \u201c record document and tangible objects \u201d refers to recordkeeping.   Another difference is that -- a common sense standpoint -- is that records can only be maintained on tangible mediums.   And it's a distinguishing factor between \u201c record document \u201d and \u201c other objects \u201d in 1512(c).   It's also limited-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But how does the Internet -- you could falsify Internet entries, or things that are in the cloud, those are intangible items. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --No, those are tangible items, Your Honor, because they are stored on a hard drive somewhere.   The cloud is not existing above.   It's merely being housed somewhere else that's accessed through the Internet on a tangible device that's designed to preserve that very type of information. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Suppose the typewriter were used to prepare an incriminating document.   The document and the typewriter were destroyed, would that be covered? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " The typewriter would not be.   The piece of paper that the typewriter is inscribing on is a device that's designed to preserve information.   It's simply making the information. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I -- I understand the argument and the argument that you make has considerable force about over criminalizing, but it seems to me that the test you suggest has almost more problems with vagueness, more problems with determining what its boundaries are than the government's test. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " No, the government's test renders 1512(c) wholly superfluous.   1519 -- first of all, the words \u201c record document \u201d and \u201c tangible object \u201d are definitions providing meaning to all of them.   The government is saying admittedly, \u201c record \u201d and \u201c document \u201d didn't need to be there and Congress had no reason to put them there because it's everything, it's all physical evidence.   A record -- a tangible object is a discrete device.   It is a device that is designed to preserve the information. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if that's the -- if that is the case, then why is it not surplusage?   Why -- what would be a tangible object designed to contain information that would not fall into the category of record or document? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " An iPad, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, an iPhone.   Those-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Those things in themselves don't -- they have documents, they have something that could be called a document or a record stored in them. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --That is-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If you -- if you have an iPad that's straight from the store, has nothing -- has no information stored in that, do you think that would fall within the statute? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --It would fall within the statute because what Congress was trying to intend to do -- and given the backdrop of the Enron situation where massive servers were destroyed or deleted or otherwise -- they were trying to -- to capture the devices that held information.   And you cannot determine what's on the device unless you have the device, regardless of whether or not there's information on it or not. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What about destroying a brand new empty filing cabinet? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " That is not a device that's used to preserve information.   That's a container of something.   It's not specifically designed to preserve information.   You could put bowling balls in a -- in a filing cabinet or otherwise.   The information, the distinguishing factor, Your Honor, between a tangible object is that the information is being preserved within it, embedded within it, like a computer or otherwise.   And Congress needed to use the general phrase \u201c tangible object \u201d for a reason, because in 2002, an iPad, an iPhone, and many other electronic devices that preserve information didn't exist, and they-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But then the Congress could have said used -- tangible object used to preserve information, and then your case would be solid.   But it just said \u201c tangible object \u201d. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --It said \u201c tangible object \u201d, that is true, Justice Ginsburg, that it said \u201c tangible object \u201d.   But it did so using that general phrase following two specific terms, \u201c record \u201d and \u201c document \u201d, which is a classic methodology in which the legislature uses-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question, because, my fault I'm sure, but I wasn't sure I understood your answer.   Not only in 1512(c)(1), but there are, you know, I think five times in 1512 from a prior enactment this same kind of phrase is used, which is \u201c record document and other object \u201d.   And you say that we should treat that phrase as it exists many times in 1512 differently from this phrase in 1519 because of the difference between tangible object and other object.   And to me, it seems like other object is, if anything, a more classic case of that canon that I can't pronounce the name of, ejusdem whatever.   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Generis. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Good.   That's what I count on my colleague for.   [Laughter]   I -- I deserved that.   But to me, it seems like a more -- even a more classic case.   So I guess I just don't understand why you're treating the two differently. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --It is, to answer your question, they're being treated differently not simply because of the inclusion of the word \u201c tangible \u201d, but because of the other words surrounding \u201c tangible object \u201d, like the unique phrase \u201c makes a false entry in \u201d, which is not included in any other obstruction of justice statute. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But just because Congress includes more verbs -- I mean, the reason Congress includes 20 verbs instead of 4 is presumably because Congress really wants to sweep in a very wide variety of conduct.   And not every verb has to apply to every situation.   In fact, we rather presume that they won't. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Although this Court has never held that all the verbs, you know, applied to all the nouns, it would make sense that they would apply.   The only instance that the United States points out is in an amended statute.   This statute was written from \u201c Whoever \u201d to the last word of this statute at the same time.   It makes sense that they all apply.   And \u201c makes false entry in \u201d is a phrase that can be used only to apply to all of the nouns under our particular construction.   And it's unique.   It is only used by Congress in record-related statutes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So your whole argument here really comes down to the fact that Congress put some record-related verbs in there? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " It does not, Your Honor.   There's additional things.   We have a limited subject matter under our definition, which makes sense because you have a tremendously broad nexus to any matter within the proper administration of the United States.   That's unlike traditional classic statutes.   It makes sense that Congress wanted to narrow the subject matter of this particular statute when you're dealing with such a broad nexus to any Federal matter. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I would think -- I'm sorry.   I would think that that cuts against you, that the fact that this is about any matter within the jurisdiction of any agency in the United States shows that it's really not just about corporate fraud, that Congress had a broader set of things in mind.   So I would think that that's -- that's quite the opposite, that everything about this statute, the \u201c any matter \u201d, the \u201c any record \u201d, suggests breadth. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " It -- it does not, Your Honor, because if you take the lens and you zoom it out a little bit further, if we look at Section 802 of Title VIII of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it's entitled \u201c Criminal Penalties For Altering Documents \u201d.   Two new criminal statutes were created: 1519, entitled   \"Destruction, alteration, and falsification of records. \"   and 1520, which is a 5-year record retention requirement on auditors.   They were -- or else they get a 10-year penalty for that.   Congress was referring, passing these, 1519 and 1520 within Section 802 of Title VIII, as a tandem, as another contextual indicator that this is intended to apply to record-related matters. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Then how do you -- how do you respond to the illustration that the government gave in its brief?   That is, what sense does it make to say you can be indicted under 1519 if you destroy a letter that the victim that you have murdered has sent you, but you can't be indicted under 1519 if you destroy the murder weapon? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Congress did not intend 1519 to be applied in that situation.   And as you state the question, Justice Ginsburg, it is remarkable that the government would use 1519 in a murder situation. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But you think it could -- would -- let me back up and ask what I assume was -- you would say yes to.   A letter is shredded.   It's a letter from the victim to the later-turned-out-to-be murderer.   That letter is shredded.   Does that come under 1519? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " That does, because that is record related.   But the knife does not.   That falls into the sweep -- that particular subject matter, because it indeed is a record, so that would be covered under 1519, but that -- not the knife.   Congress didn't intend to sweep the knife into 1519, but-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Where did the -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What if the knife had the defendant's name on it?   Is that, destroying the knife, is that altering, destroying a record? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --It is not.   One would not, Mr. Chief Justice, refer to an inscription of one's name as a permanent account of an event.   It's just an identification.   It's an identification on the knife. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but presumably the same would be true of a lot of documents or records that are destroyed. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " But in ordinary parlance, one would not consider an inscription on a knife to be it.   It's evidence, but it's not a -- it's not a document, it's not a record or otherwise, and it doesn't fall within the very limited subject matter that Congress wrote into this particular statute, which is records. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Now, what do you say about 1512(c)?   Would the knife fall under that? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " 1519 and 12(c), it would make more sense that the knife fall in, and here's why.   It's a more classic-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Even if the knife was used in the murder, but it was destroyed before anybody was caught? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --It would -- it would -- if it was destroyed with the intent to impair that object's availability in an official proceeding, which is a classic, classic obstruction statute-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So did the government mischarge here?   Could they have charged your client with violating 1512(c)? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --It's possible the government could have charged that particular thing, but-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I love those words, \u201c possible \u201d.

Badalamenti", "text": " My defense would have been something very significant, difference between 1512(c) and 1519.   1519 only requires that-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I know you were charged with.   What would have been your defense to 15-- "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --He didn't corruptly do it.   And corruptly is wrongful, immoral, depraved or evil, not simply knowingly, which is required under 1519, which is voluntarily and intentionally done.   See, \u201c corruptly \u201d is used in 1512(c) purposefully in that particular information because it is, perhaps, a broader class, and it is-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Destroyed and substituting fish is not a corrupt act.

Badalamenti", "text": " Which was the question, Your Honor.   Okay?   So what we -- what we have in 1519 -- what we have in 1519 is a remarkable situation when you're looking at Chapter 73 in total, is that you have this incredibly broad nexus to any Federal matter within the jurisdiction of the United States.   What can the matter be?   As the amicus briefs point out, any of 300,000 Federal regulations that the Federal Government has placed down upon the American people. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And what is your view, given what you've just said, of the best way to narrow this statute? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " The best way to narrow this statute, Justice Breyer, is to interpret \u201c tangible object \u201d in the company it keeps, and that is a device that is designed to preserve information such that if that device is destroyed, the information contained on that device is destroyed. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You still have the problem of the language of the statute covering the destruction of a document such as an EPA questionnaire that comes to the door asking about recycling, where you know that the EPA would like to have that back to help them do their official work of finding out how the program works.   You, believing that that's their business, not yours, tear it up and throw it in the wastebasket.   Now, does that fall within the statute? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Well, it-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It surely does within the language. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --It falls within-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And your effort to narrow the statute has nothing to do with that. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --The narrowing is the document itself.   This statute's exceedingly broad.   Our-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But my problem, of course, is reading the statute and taking your argument in the context that you mean it, which is we must look for a way to narrow this statute, which at first blush seems far broader than any witness-tampering statute, any obstruction of justice statute, any not lying to an FBI agent statute that I've ever seen, let alone those within Section 15.   So what I'd like you to focus on is not your problem, though they're connected, but my problem. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --Focusing on your problem, Justice Breyer, I would say that it is not an onerous situation for individuals to retain documents.   It is not an onerous situation on the American people to -- particularly what we have on flash drives attached to a key chain that can hold thousands and thousands-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Right.   I see where you're going. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --of documents. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I see where you're going.   Let's follow you down that road: That you say in many situations it should not be a crime to retain a document, even though you know that the Census Bureau would like it back or perhaps the EPA. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And perhaps it's nothing more than trying to find out information.   But where you end up at the end of the road is that this is void for vagueness, but not for any reason you have yet told us.   So what am I to do with the fact, if that is a serious problem, that it has never been argued in this case? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Well, I would accept the invitation that it would be void for vagueness, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Why is it vague?   It's -- it's just incredibly expansive. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " It -- it-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What is vague about the fact that if you destroy a questionnaire, you destroy a document with the intent of, what is it, to impede, obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration.   What's vague about it? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " The answer to that, if you want to pose it as a question to me ----   [Laughter]   --would be that the void for vagueness, if you look at Skilling, has two branches.   From Kolender v. Lawson -- Justice Ginsburg wrote it -- a penal statute defining the criminal offense, one, with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand.   That's what Justice Scalia has just talked about.   You can understand what is prohibited.   But then there is two: In a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.   It's that second part, that the doctrine extends the doctrine to statutes that, while they may be clear, are far too broad, well beyond what any sensible prosecutor would even want to prosecute. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --Well, I agree with that. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   Then back to the question. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " The answer -- the answer would be that perhaps a way to reconcile this statute would be not only to accept our position that it relates to recordkeeping generally, but that it requires specifically, relates to business recordkeeping, where businesses are on notice such as SEC filing quarterly requirements or otherwise, that they are to do specific things.   And if you look against the backdrop of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there is plenty of support that Congress was targeting businesses, corporations, and publicly traded companies. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Isn't -- isn't running a fishing vessel a business? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " It would be running a business, Your Honor, it would be.   And a possible way to limit this particular circumstance would be to limit it to -- to businesses.   It doesn't change the fact that \u201c tangible object \u201d doesn't mean everything. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Can you -- can you tell me the exact consequences for your client?   Because as I understand it, he was also charged under 22 -- what is it -- 2232? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And he could have gotten the same sentence? "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " No.   No, Your Honor.   2232 is destroying a piece of property subject to seizure.   That's a 5-year statutory maximum.   1519 has a 20-year statutory maximum.

Badalamenti", "text": " 30 -- he ended up getting 30 days by a judge that made that individualized decision under the Booker factors.   But we can't count on judges being like those -- that judge around the United States.   The fact remains is that-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But you're only arguing for your client.   This is not some kind of class action. "}, {"speaker": "John L. Badalamenti", "text": " --No, Your Honor, this is just related to Mr. Yates.   But the idea is that -- my understanding is that when the courts are writing the opinions, they're thinking about all the judges in the United States and providing guidance to all the judges, providing guidance to the prosecutors when to use particular statutes.   And if this Court permits that this statute be applied for the disposal of all physical evidence that would contravene the textual and contextual terms and indicators that I brought through throughout this argument, it is basically the overreaching broad thing that Congress has never passed, despite the government's attempt to inject in the Model Penal Code into this case, which 1519 looks nothing like the Model Penal Code.

It added 1519 to cover record-related matters, 20 years.   1512(c) is related to official proceedings -- we've discussed that earlier -- 20 years.   It upped wire fraud, mail fraud, from 5 years all the way up to 20 years.   Why did Congress do that?   It did that because it recognized the harm that Enron/Arthur Andersen type of situations did to the financial well-being of this country and the investors in public markets, and it wanted to send a message to the public to not engage in record destruction that could impede or influence the proper administration of any matter.   That's why it's important to limit the subject matter of this particular statute to just record-related matters.

It was -- it was a reasonable decision based on the language of the statute.

I'd like to say a few words about the various textual arguments that -- that Petitioner has put forward, the nouns, the verbs and the headings.   First of all, with respect to -- with respect to the nouns, I think the historical evidence that we've put forward, I think, show conclusively that the term \u201c record \u201d, \u201c document \u201d, and \u201c tangible things \u201d is very, very similar to the standard formulation that essentially everyone has used to cover all physical evidence in the obstruction of justice context for over five decades.

We've cited 35 different provisions of the U.S. Code and of the -- the discovery rules in the criminal context and in the civil context.   Those are at Footnote 3 of our brief.   In all of those instances, they use the phrase \u201c tangible things \u201d or \u201c tangible object \u201d to refer to everything.

"}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " --You know, if -- the tradition of -- of the degree of penalty to attach to this offense has changed over time.   As you point out, the Model Penal Code did identify this as a misdemeanor.   The Brown Commission, which built on the Model Penal Code, treated it as a misdemeanor or as a felony, depending on the severity of the underlying offense.   When Congress sat down in the '70s and '80s and was trying to incorporate, essentially, that provision into Federal law unsuccessfully, over a dozen times it treated it as a felony.   And then, or course, Congress in Sarbanes-Oxley Act in both 1512(c)(1) and in 1519 also treated it as a felony with a 20-year penalty.   And -- and with respect to that penalty, again, I think it's important to emphasize that the text that's at issue here, any tangible object, that was fixed and that was drafted -- it was in the bill that was introduced by Senator Leahy at the time when it was only a 5-year penalty.   And there's no reason to think that when Congress tinkered with that penalty, it meant to kind of, by implication, shrink the scope of tangible objects that's at issue here.   And I think just to emphasize the -- the textual point, it's -- it's a very unusual and I think it's -- it's highly implausible to believe that Congress chose this broad and expansive phrase, \u201c any tangible object \u201d, when really what it really wanted to do was refer only to a very narrow and specific category of information storage devices.

It's not consistent with how Congress drafts statutes, it's not consistent with Petitioner's own interpretation, and I think there's significant tension with this Court's decision last year in Roberts.   Let me say a word about each.   With respect to how Congress drafts statutes, I think you only have to look to Section 1505 of the statute to see that that's yet another example of where Congress has used -- had a bunch of verbs and a bunch of nouns and some of the nouns don't work with some of the verbs.   You can't mutilate oral testimony.   With respect to Petitioner, the inconsistency with Petitioner's own theory, Petitioner agrees that 1519 covers the destruction of an e-mail in electronic form.   You can't mutilate an e-mail.   No one would ever talk like that.   Similarly, he says that it would apply to a blank hard drive.   But no one -- I've never heard anyone talk about falsifying a blank hard drive.   So the implications of his argument are inconsistent with -- with where he wants the Court to go.   And then finally, the Roberts case.   Roberts dealt with a circumstance, it wasn't perfectly analogous, but it was -- it raised a similar problem, which is that there was a broad statute, it had many different applications, and there was some language in the statute that was a little bit awkward and a little bit superfluous with regard to some of the applications of the statute.   And the response that the Court had to that problem was not to say, well, the statute doesn't apply to those circumstances.   The response was to say that that's the linguistic price to be paid, linguistic price to be paid for having a broad statute.   And then the Court said Congress does not need to write extra language specifically exempting, phrase by phrase, applications with respect to which a portion of a phrase is not needed.   I think that was right in Roberts and I think the same principle applies here.   Finally, Your Honor, with respect to the headings, a couple points.   First, I think the headings in this case as in -- as in the Lawson case that this Court also dealt with last term also involving Sarbanes-Oxley, the headings here are just obviously and unambiguously under inclusive.   The heading is a shorthand reference to the general subject matter.   It's not intended to spell out what the operative provisions say or to mirror those operative provisions.   It's obviously under inclusive.   It omits a whole bunch of the verbs.   It omits two of the nouns.   The heading argument, I think, is especially unreliable in this context where if you look at what Congress did with Sarbanes-Oxley generally, it was not paying very close attention to the headings under which it put various provisions.   That's true with respect to 1519, that's true with respect to 1514, the statute that was at issue in the Lawson case, and it's also true with respect to Section 1512(c)(1).   Section 1512(c)(1) prohibits me from -- prohibits any person from destroying evidence.   But they put that -- that provision inside the witness-tampering statute.   It doesn't make sense; it doesn't fit there.   And that just shows that Congress was not paying close attention to the headings and that that shouldn't drive the outcome of this case.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, Mr. Martinez, you are really -- I mean, you have arguments on all of these points, but you are really asking the Court to swallow something that is pretty hard to swallow.   Do you deny that this statute, as you read it, is capable of being applied to really trivial matters, and yet each of those would carry a potential penalty of 20 years, and then you go further and say that it is the policy of the Justice Department that this has to be applied in every one of those crazy little cases.   And this involved a business and a number of fish.   What if it was one fish?   What if it was one undersized fish that was caught by a fisherman in a national -- on Federal land?   This would be -- would it apply here? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Your Honor, I want to answer that question, but I just want to clarify what I said about our policy.

Now, I -- I appreciate the force of the hypothetical and I understand it, but I think I want to -- the point I want to emphasize, because maybe there's -- I understand why the Court might have concerns about that.   The problem -- there's a mismatch, though, between Petitioner's argument and the hypothetical.   The problem with the hypothetical is that this statute might be harsh in certain particular outlier applications.   But Petitioner is not arguing for some sort of de minimis rule, he's not saying that this statute can't be applied in trivial cases.   He's arguing that an entire class of evidence is entirely outside the scope of the statute-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

Suppose I worry about Justice Alito's single fish in the case of a camper who kicks an ember away, knowing you shouldn't have built the campfire or picks a flower, knowing you're supposed to let wildflowers blossom.   What about that 20 years, and you could multiply those beyond belief.   So if that's the problem, does his client go to prison because we've just assumed that problem away from the case?

And if the case -- the ember case comes up or the postman case comes up, then -- and if the arguments are made, then I think those arguments can be fleshed out, they can be briefed, they can be thought through by the parties, and I think they'll be properly presented to the Court in that case.   In this case, though, this case presents just a common sense, straightforward question of statutory interpretation.   Does the phrase \u201c any tangible object \u201d actually mean what Congress said?   Does it refer to all tangible objects?   We think that the unambiguous answer based on the text of the statute, based on the history of the statute, is -- is clearly yes, and we ask this Court to affirm. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

The \u201c tangible object \u201d notion is extremely important, which the justices have pointed out under Russello.   You have the fact that you have two statutes passed in the same act.   One includes different language than the other.   To presume that that language is included in there intentionally and that major significance makes false entry in all of the statutes that are -- we've cited in our brief in Footnote 4, that reference of the reply brief -- all of them are record-related statutes.   Every single one of them has a textural indication of what Congress had meant.
