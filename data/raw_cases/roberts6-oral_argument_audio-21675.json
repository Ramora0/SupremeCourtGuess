[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1448, Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association.   Mr. Morazzini. "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The California law at issue today before this Court differs from the New York law at issue in Ginsberg in only one respect.   Where New York was concerned with minors' access to harmful sexual material outside the guidance of a parent, California is no less concerned with a minor's access to the deviant level of violence that is presented in a certain category of video games that can be no less harmful to the development of minors.   When this Court in Ginsberg crafted a rule of law that permits States to regulate a minor's access to such material outside the presence of a parent, it did so for two fundamental reasons that are equally applicable this morning in this case.   First, this rule permits parents' claim to authority in their own household to direct the upbringing and development of their children; and secondly, this rule promotes the State's independent interest in helping parents protect the wellbeing of children in those instances when parents cannot be present.   So this morning, California asks this Court to adopt a rule of law that permits States to restrict minors' ability to purchase deviant, violent video games that the legislature has determined can be harmful to the development-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What's a deviant -- a deviant, violent video game?

The authors there note that video games are not only exemplary teachers of pro-social activities, but also exemplary teachers of aggression, which was the fundamental concern of the California legislature in enacting this statute.   So while the science is continually developing, indeed, it appears that studies are being released every month regarding-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Suppose a new study suggested that movies were just as violent.   Then, presumably, California could regulate movies just as it could regulate video games? "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P.

One of the studies, the Anderson study, says that the effect of violence is the same for a Bugs Bunny episode as it is for a violent video.

They could have said, oh, we've had violence in Grimm's fairy tales, but we've never had it live on the screen.   I mean, every time there's a new technology, you can make that argument. "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, I think that's the beauty of incorporating the three prongs of the Miller standard into California's law.   This standard is very prophylactic and ensures that only a narrow category of material will be covered, certainly not Grimm's fairy tales.

We decide whether a category of speech has a historical tradition of being regulated.   Now, other than some State statutes that you point to, some of which are very clearly the same as those that we struck down in Wynn, where is the tradition of regulating violence? "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " Your Honor, California submits that when the rights of minors are at issue and not the rights of adults, the standard should be more flexible.   The Constitution should recognize that when the audience is minors the same standard should not apply.   Therefore, the question should not be whether or not historically violent speech was regulated, but whether or not the Constitution guarantees minors a right.

Because I read your briefs all the way through and the only thing that I found you said that was clearly covered by this statute was Postal 2.   But presumably the statute applies to more than one video game.   So what else does it apply to?   How many video games?   What kind of video games?

Justice Kagan, I would go back to the language of the statute, and the statute covers video games where the range of options available to the player includes maiming, killing, dismembering, torturing, sexually assaulting, and those types of violence.

Kennedy", "text": " Let me just make one comment on that point.   It seems to me all or at least the great majority of the questions today are designed to probe whether or not this statute is vague.   And you say the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the categories that have been used in the obscenity area, and that there's an obvious parallel there.   The problem is, is that for generations there has been a societal consensus about sexual material.   Sex and violence have both been around a long time, but there is a societal consensus about what's offensive for sexual material and there are judicial discussions on it.   Now, those judicial discussions are not precise.   You could have had the same questions today with reference to an obscenity statute, and we have -- we have said that, with reference to obscenity there are certain -- that there are certain materials that are not protected.   Those rules are not precise at the margins and some would say not precise in a more significant degree as well.   But you are asking us to go into an entirely new area where there is no consensus, no judicial opinions.   And this is -- and this indicates to me the statute might be vague, and I just thought you would like to know that -- that reaction. "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " --Justice Kennedy, as with sexual -- the regulation of sexual material and obscenity, we had to start somewhere.   California is choosing to start now.   We can build a consensus as to what level of violence is in fact patently offensive for minors, is deviant for minors, just as the case law has developed over time with sexual depictions.   Your Honor, I believe the key is the similarities violence has with sex. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What about excessive glorification of drinking, movies that have too much drinking?   Does it have an effect on minors?   I suppose so.   I -- I am not just concerned with the vagueness.   I am concerned with the vagueness, but I am concerned with the First Amendment, which says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.   And it was always understood that the freedom of speech did not include obscenity.   It has never been understood that the freedom of speech did not include portrayals of violence.   You are asking us to create a -- a whole new prohibition which the American people never -- never ratified when they ratified the First Amendment.   They knew they were -- you know, obscenity was -- was bad, but -- what's next after violence?   Drinking?   Smoking?   Movies that show smoking can't be shown to children?   Does -- will that affect them?   Of course, I suppose it will.   But is -- is that -- are -- are we to sit day by day to decide what else will be made an exception from the First Amendment?   Why -- why is this particular exception okay, but the other ones that I just suggested are not okay? "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P.

Because this Court, with respect to the fighting words, Chaplinsky's \"in your face\", provoked an immediate action, the Court has been very careful to cordon that off so it doesn't have this spillover potential.   So you -- you didn't latch on to fighting words.   Your analogy is to obscenity for teenagers, as I understand it. "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " --Yes, Justice Ginsburg.   With regard to fighting words, the -- the societal interest in preventing acts of violence is -- is different than the concern at issue here today. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So could I just make -- make sure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because as I understand the State has given up its argument that the interest protected by this law is an interest in preventing minors who see these games from going out and committing violent acts themselves; that the State is not saying that that's the interest in the law; is that correct?   That instead the State is saying that the interest in the law is in protecting children's moral development generally? "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " Justice Kagan, we welcome that as -- as an effect of California's regulation, but the primary interest was the internal intrinsic harm to minors.   That's what the State of California is deeply concerned with in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Can I have a point of clarification?   Justice Ginsburg talked about the labeling parts of this act.   The circuit court struck those portions of the act.   You have not challenged that ruling. "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " Justice-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There are two sections to the act.   One is a criminal act for selling to a minor, and the other is a requirement that you label in a certain way each video.   The district court said both were -- I think the circuit court said both were unconstitutional, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " --Yes, Justice Sotomayor.   They found-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And your brief has not addressed the labeling requirements at all. "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " --Well, we didn't, Your Honor, because one holding of the Ninth Circuit hinged upon the other.   In striking down the body of California's law, the restriction on the sales, the court found that since it's not illegal to sell these games to 18-year-olds, that the governmental purpose served behind the label itself was -- was in fact misleading.   So under the Zadora case law, I don't have the case cite before me, but under Zadora regarding lawyers' advertising of -- of services, it -- the government can require the labeling, so long as it's necessary to prevent misleading the consumer.   The Ninth Circuit found that because they struck down the body of our law, that the 18> [\"] label would be misleading.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's an interesting concession on your part, that the labeling doesn't have a need separate from the restriction on sale.   I would have thought that if you wanted a lesser restriction, that you would have promoted labeling as a reasonable strict scrutiny restriction to permit the control of sale of these materials to minors; but you seem to have given up that argument altogether.

And the American Psychiatric -- Psychological Association, the American Pediatric Association, sign on to a long list on I think it is the Anderson side that this does hurt children.

Any harm that is supposed to be inflicted on them is supposed to take place over a period of years, not minutes, so the parent has ample opportunity to exercise parental supervision over what games are being played in the house.

There is a category -- call them X -- which really are involving things like torturing children, et cetera.   Maybe you don't like to sell them to anybody.   You have an X or some special thing.

That is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is being limited, it is being done for a good reason, compelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X videos and the torture and living it through -- and there is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also significantly less effective.   See, I want you to deal with that directly, because what you have been doing for the most part is saying we would have to be in some new, total new area, et cetera.

"}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But on that -- on that score, Mr. Smith, there is a study by the FCC.   The question is whether violence can be restricted during the hours when most children are awake, just the way pornography is.   I don't remember what -- what are the hours, that -- something like from 10:00 in the evening?   I don't -- but didn't the FCC say, yes, we could do the same thing for violence that we are doing for sex, except we don't think we ought to do it, we think Congress should do it? "}, {"speaker": "Paul M. Smith", "text": " What they did was they spent several years trying to come up with a definition that would allow anybody to figure out which violent TV shows have to be put into this violent adult category and which don't, and they eventually punted and said, we have no idea to do that; Congress asked us to do it; we cannot do it; and they punted it back to Congress to try to come up with a definition.   This is a very difficult task, trying to use language to differentiate levels of violence or types of violence in a manner that would in some way tell people what the rules of the game are.   I think even if you think that there is some problem out there that needs to be solved, you ought to think very carefully about whether or not you are going to authorize some creation of a new rule authorizing regulation in this area, when nobody will have any idea what the scope of it is. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And you say there is no problem because 16-year-olds in California never have $50 available to go buy a video game, and because they never have TVs in their room and their parents are always home watching what they -- they do with their video games, and the parents -- and the video games have features that allow parents to block access to -- to block the playing of violent video games, which can't be overcome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old, that's why there is no problem, right? "}, {"speaker": "Paul M. Smith", "text": " I guess if what we are really going to do is judge the constitution of this law based on what 16 and 17-year-olds are getting and whether that would be harmful to them, I think the problem there is the line between 16 and 17 and 18 is so fine, that you are not going to be able to identify any real category of games that fits into that category.   And it's important by the way to note that California hasn't told us whether we should judge 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 17-year-olds.   If it's 5-year-olds, it's vastly overrestrictive; if it's 17-year-olds I suspect -- I suspect it wouldn't restrict anything because nobody is going to be able to convince a -- jury, well, this is an 18-year-old game, not a 17-year-old game. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We draw that kind of line of course in the death penalty area, don't we?   Between 18-year-olds?   You are under 18; you can't be sentenced to life without parole; if you were over 18 you can. "}, {"speaker": "Paul M. Smith", "text": " You do draw that line, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " And we do it for drinking; we do it for driving. "}, {"speaker": "Paul M. Smith", "text": " But here you were assessing works of expression, deciding to decide what age they -- they would correspond to, and I don't think you can cut it that finely and say well, this is an 18 game; this is only a 17 game.   I just don't think that works.   So if that's the test, the test Justice Breyer suggested it ought to be, then the statute essentially would restrict nothing.   If the test is 5-year-olds-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Stick to the X things, maybe.   Maybe it would restrict the total gratuitous torture.   And if that's what it restricted, why is that such a terrible thing? "}, {"speaker": "Paul M. Smith", "text": " --Well, first of all-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And if as you experimented with other things, as they did in the obscenity area, you could discover you could limit it to that. "}, {"speaker": "Paul M. Smith", "text": " --I think the maybe is telling, though, Your Honor.   Somebody, as Justice Scalia would point out, in publishing a game has to know what -- what -- what the rules of the game are in advance.   Subject to hundreds of millions of dollars of penalties, this is $1,000 a game penalty.   If-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, you have your rule, so why wouldn't the first step be they would follow your rules?   Your rules.   The X things would be limited to people who are over 18, and let's see if we ever get prosecuted for a different one.   And you might never. "}, {"speaker": "Paul M. Smith", "text": " --Our rules wouldn't help you at all.   They say that they are only restricting a smaller number, a small subset of M-rated games, which by the way, we say are appropriate for 17-year-olds.   So these ratings that the state wants us to impose are going to conflict with the ratings that are already on the packaging which are being used by parents every day to make these judgments.   So it's actually interfering.   The prospect of it would interfere with the information already on the packaging. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Smith.   Mr. Morazzini, you have four minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Zackery P. Morazzini", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   I wanted to address one point that has been raised about minors' ability to access these games.   Yes, new games do cost $60, but California's law also regulates the rental of these video games, which is just a few dollars per game.   So minors certainly can afford them and can access them.   But I also wanted to draw out the point that California's law really is not an ordinance that is directed to a plot of a game.   It's expressly directed to games with essentially no plot, no artistic value.   This is the helpful nature of the third prong of the Miller standard.   So it really is only going after the nature of the game where the child is-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me.
