[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1371, Christian Legal Society Chapter of the University of California -- Hastings v. Martinez.   Mr. McConnell. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If Hastings is correct, a student who does not even believe in the Bible is entitled to demand to lead a Christian Bible study, and if CLS does not promise to allow this, the college will bar them from its forum for speech.   The First Amendment -- under the First Amendment, rights run the opposite way.   Hastings is the government; CLS is private.   A public forum for speech must be open and inclusive, but participants in the forum are entitled to their own voice. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Now, these are fundamental arguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on factual matters because that's frustrating to both the Court and the counsel.   But we do have the problem of the stipulation.   The stipulation makes it clear that Democrats and Republicans can both get into the other one's club.   That's the Stipulations 17 and 18 at 220 of the Joint Appendix.   You want to get away from the stipulation by what, according to your reply brief, Hastings said in its answer, but the stipulation supersedes the answer.   So if both counsel could just address for a moment: What is the case that we have here?   You have different views on what case is before us. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " Happy to, Justice Kennedy.   If you just look with me at Joint Stipulation 17, I think it makes this completely clear.   That's on page 221 of the Joint Appendix, and it states:   \"Both parties agreed that in order to become a registered student organization a student organization's bylaws must provide that its membership is open to all students. \"   --that's the all-comers policy --   \"and the organization must agree to abide by. \"   --\"abide by the Nondiscrimination Policy\".   That's capital N, capital P, a defined term.   The 15.   That is what we have been calling the written policy.   And the idea that membership must be open to all students is described in Joint Stipulation 18, which is simply a description of what that policy is. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But doesn't -- doesn't the one -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with that you automatically comply with everything in the nondiscrimination clause? "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " It is broader.   It's our position that either of these justifications for excluding CLS is unconstitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes, but -- but the latter, the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that argument is not available to you. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " Justice Scalia, our argument -- there are two policies.   They have invoked both.   We believe both are unconstitutional, but for slightly different reasons.   The written policy is unconstitutional because it's overtly viewpoint discrimination -- discriminatory and thus violating the principles of cases like Rosenberger and Widmar.   The all-comers-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But, Mr. McConnell, Justice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers policy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to deal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean in her deposition said, loud and clear:   \"Our policy is all-comers. \"   \"Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the Democratic group and vice versa. \"   So unless you are challenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating, as you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see how we can listen to your argument about the so-called written policy. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --Well, both policies we contend are unconstitutional.   Let's begin with the all-comers policy, and when you conclude that it is unconstitutional, we will also need to deal with the other since they have two arrows in their quiver. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " You can do that, but you -- it's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS differently than it treats the Democratic and Republican Clubs.   That's a much different -- frankly, it's a much easier case for you.   But it's -- it's frustrating for us not to know what kind of case we have in front of us. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " Your Honor, it's a case where the -- where Hastings has put forward two quite different justifications for denying our right and both of them are unconstitutional.   Let's begin with the all-comers policy. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. McConnell, when I read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted to the district court at the same time that the joint stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in fact insisting that all registered student organizations admit all applicants.   And when I read their brief in the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and again.   So that led me to believe that what was stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which they enforced under which anybody who applied to any group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean Kane had announced.   That was the stated policy, but not necessarily the actual policy that was employed.   And that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was making; isn't that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " That's entirely correct, Justice -- Justice Alito.   That's-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, you should -- if that was it you should have brought in some -- some evidence of different treatment of other groups.   And there -- as I-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --Justice-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --There is none of that except your citation of the bylaws of two groups in your brief, as I-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --Well, but that is in fact the evidence.   When-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But, Mr. McConnell, here is a statement, a stipulation.   It's a stipulation for summary judgment.   It says: District Judge, you take this to be the fact: Hastings requires that registered student organizations allow any student to participate, become a member, seek leadership positions in the organization.   That is not qualified.   It says: District Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate.   It doesn't say this is what the dean says, but it's not really enforced.   It's not qualified at all. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --Justice Ginsburg, we -- we stipulated that this was their policy.   That stipulation contains nothing about the historical facts as to how Hastings has actually applied it.   But let's talk about the policy, because it is unconstitutional-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --I wish you would.   You are going to waste your whole time just discussing this stipulation point.   Let's assume -- let's assume that-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --the latter is the policy. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " Yes, because the policy is I think blatantly unconstitutional.   It is manifestly overbroad with respect to any purposes stated.   And, of course, in Healy v. James, this Court held that any restriction on a student speech forum may be no more extensive than is required by its purposes.   It is also a frontal assault on freedom of association.   Freedom of association is the right to form around shared beliefs.   To say that groups may not form around shared beliefs-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So is this an exception that you want to talk about as it is applied to religious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all handicapped persons, whatever other form of discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds, and otherwise lend it space? "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --Not at all, Justice Sotomayor.   Our position is that-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So then, what is -- what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates? "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --The stipulation is that they may not exclude based on status or beliefs.   We have only challenged the beliefs, not status.   Race, any other status basis Hastings is able to enforce.   But they may not tell a group-- "}, {"speaker": "John Paul Stevens", "text": " So, what if the belief-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --that you just have to let you in that don't agree with you. "}, {"speaker": "John Paul Stevens", "text": " --What if the belief is that African Americans are inferior?

Breyer", "text": " Doesn't this say the opposite?   It says we are -- you have to let anybody in -- anybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs.   So you can't discriminate on the basis of status or belief.   That's what the policy says I just read.   It doesn't say you can; it says you can't. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --It's that the group may not confine its leadership based upon its beliefs.   That means that-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's what you say, but that's not what the policy says.   The policy says that you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status or belief. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W.

And they say: No, we don't want to; that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones we should, which ones we shouldn't.   We'd rather let them work off-campus.   We just don't want to get into this business.   It's not just against religion.   It might be against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish is extremely important to speak or a chess club that thinks the same.   It could be a lot of people.   Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have those on campus organizations, too much trouble. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " What is -- what is wrong with that is that restrictions on a designated public forum must be reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.   The purpose of the forum is set forth in Joint Stipulation Number 8.   It is to promote a diversity of viewpoints among registered student organizations.   If the student organizations are not allowed to have a coherent set of beliefs, there can be no diversity among them. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But this sounds like a debate over whether the policy as the school believes it should be implemented is not a good one.   But isn't that their choice?   Don't we give deference to an educational institution in terms of the choices it makes about effecting its own -- its purposes?   And the purpose here is we don't want our students to discriminate.

So-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " Which is not the joint stipulation.   The stipulation is that the purpose of the forum is diversity among groups.   Their policy is not -- it's not only just unreasonable in light of it; it is contrary to it. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --It is that they-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael W.

They are not backing off from: We think diversity among groups is fine. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W.

Joint Stipulation Number 40 states clearly that the -- that the -- that they were informed, and I quote:   \"They were informed that CLS bylaws were not compliant with the religion and sexual orientation provisions of the Nondiscrimination Policy. \" "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

When the dean announced it at the deposition, she said all students may participate on the -- in all activities, period, full stop.   Now we find out in their brief, well, their -- groups can have conduct limitations, they can require dues, they can have attendance requirements, they can have competitive contests to see whether they get in.   This -- this policy is -- it changes with every wind.   And -- but the fundamental problem with this -- with this is what -- what this Court stated in Velazquez v. Legal Services Corporation, that you cannot allow -- you cannot allow the terms of the policy just to say that whatever their policy is, that that determines the contours of the program, because that would render the First Amendment a -- a nullity. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Of course, that was not a religion case.   Your argument at its most fundamental level is that religious organizations are different because religion is all about belief.   But at that point don't we also have a tradition of separation?   That's the whole reason why church and state for many purposes are kept separate, so that States are not implicated with religious beliefs.   And it -- it -- it seems to me we have to consider that when we are considering your argument.   Now, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is different from that. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " The separation is between church and state, but this Court has held over and over again that speech forums -- that people participating in a speech forum are not the state.   The state is Hastings.   We are perfectly private.   There is nothing wrong with a religious organization, even on public-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You're not-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Anyway, as I understand your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature of CLS.   You would make the same argument of unconstitutionality with respect to the student Republican Club, wouldn't you? "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " --We would. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Or-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " Now, we do -- there is in addition a free exercise argument, but I don't -- but in this case what the Free Exercise Clause protects is exactly what the associational freedom test would protect for everyone. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I had thought that an important part of the case, of your case, is that belief is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must be protected.   But if the protection causes problems within the school for other policies, then doesn't the separation policy come into play?   That's -- that's what I'm asking. "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " Again, separation does not apply to private parties when they are operating, even on government property. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. McConnell, let's say it is the belief of this group, based on their reading of the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible studies, can become officers of the group, and that's based on their fundamental belief that that's what the Bible instructs.   On your view, must Hastings give this organization status as a recognized student organization? "}, {"speaker": "Michael W. McConnell", "text": " No, Justice Ginsburg.   Our position is it is unconstitutional to -- to prohibit groups to form around beliefs but not around status. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But the belief is -- this is the belief.
