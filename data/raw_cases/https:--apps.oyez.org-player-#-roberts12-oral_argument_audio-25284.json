[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 21-463, Whole Woman's Health versus Jackson. Mr. Hearron. "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In enacting Senate Bill 8, the Texas legislature not only deliberately prohibited the exercise of a constitutional right recognized by this Court, it did everything it could to evade effective judicial protection of that right in federal or state court. Texas delegated enforcement to literally any person anywhere except its own state officials.   The only conceivable reason for doing so was to evade federal court review under Ex parte Young. Texas then created special rules applicable only to S.B. 8 claims that make it all but impossible to protect one's constitutional rights in state court.   For a single abortion, the law authorizes limitless suits in all 254 counties and provides that a victory in one has no preclusive effect in any other. Texas incentivized enforcement through awards of at least $10,000 per prohibited abortion against each defendant, without any showing of injury, and it added draconian one-sided fees provisions, with liability extended even to attorneys themselves. The combined effect is to transform the state courts from a forum for the protection of rights into a mechanism for nullifying them. As Respondent Dickson has said, no rational abortion provider would violate this law. While court clerks are not ordinarily proper defendants, in these circumstances, the principles underlying Ex parte Young authorize federal court relief against clerks.   Their docketing of S.B. 8 suits, which is critical to effectuate Texas's illegal scheme, inflicts Article III injury in fact and is redressable by an order barring such docketing. S.B. 8 is an abortion prohibition, but the issues before this Court are far more sweeping.   To allow Texas's scheme to stand would provide a roadmap for other states to abrogate any decision of this Court with which they disagree.   At issue here is nothing less than the supremacy of federal law. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Counsel, you rely on Ex parte Young to some extent, but Ex parte Young makes clear that federal courts cannot enjoin state judges. So how do you distinguish your case from the express language in Ex parte Young? "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " Your Honor, the -- the language in Ex parte Young that I believe you're referring to discusses and -- and specifically allows an injunction against the commencement of the suit.   And I -- and, Your Honor, I think, here, that supports an injunction against the clerks. It distinguishes between restraining the commencement of a suit versus a -- a suit that -- after it has already been filed.   So I think that that -- that language actually supports relief against the clerks here. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " But -- "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " It's also premised, Your Honor, on there being an executive official who you could enjoin.   And, here, the state has intentionally taken away the executive officials. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " But that's -- that's a -- that's what the case was about.   It was about enforcing an action against a party. Hence, the case -- the focus is on enforcement, as opposed to adjudicating that enforcement. And I don't think it really distinguishes it to say, well, this isn't about that.   I mean, it expressly excludes enjoining a state court. "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think it -- it -- it -- it -- it excludes enjoining the court -- the -- a -- a -- an action after it has already been filed, but it allows for -- it says that -- that there is the power to restrain the commencement of the suit. And -- and I appreciate -- and I understand, Your Honor, that in that suit it was an injunction against the state official who was -- who was commencing the suit, but I don't think that it is -- I think the principles underlying Ex parte Young, which are to allow a federal forum for the vindication of federal constitutional rights, would support an action here against the clerks to enjoin the commencement of a suit. I also think that that language in Ex parte Young is not about sovereign immunity.   It wasn't in the part of the -- the section of the opinion where the Court was addressing sovereign immunity.   It was addressing a remedy that's available by courts in equity. And, here, Section 1983 now provides that remedy, and it expressly allows suits against judges acting in their judicial capacity.   But I don't think you need to reach the judges issue, Your Honor, because I think that language does support an injunction and the principles underlying Ex parte Young.

We -- we sought -- consistent with the text of Section 1983, we sought declaratory relief against judges and -- and an injunction against the clerks, and I -- I think that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So let's go to what the harm is that you're seeking an injunction against the clerks for.

"}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly right.   It is the fact -- there's a combination of various ways that the state has -- has created special rules applicable only to S.B. 8 to make state courts a -- a tool that can be used to nullify constitutional rights that have been recognized by this Court. And I -- and I would point to -- I think there are four essential components of S.B. 8 that the legislature created. First is it allows anyone to enforce, regardless of any injury. Second, it allows those suits to be brought anywhere in Texas, even for one abortion.   So an abortion provider could face suits all across the state for a single abortion, multiplied by all the -- the additional abortions that are provided. And then there's no preclusive effect. Even if an abortion provider wins a case about that abortion, they still have to continue to face suit after suit after suit because there's no preclusive effect.   It turns the -- the provider or the -- the abortion supporter into a permanent defendant -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Isn't it the case that the Texas constitution requires a plaintiff to show injury in fact in accordance with the same standard that applies in federal court? One of the first points you made, I think maybe the first point, was that S.B. 8 allows anybody to sue, whether or not that person has suffered any injury. Is that accurate under Texas law? "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " I think the answer is unclear, and -- but in the -- in United States' case, in the preliminary injunction hearing, Texas, the state -- the lawyer for the state told the district court that Texas law is quite different from federal law on the question of how standing and private interests versus public interests work.   They said that at page 49 of the transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing.   And Texas courts -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But hasn't the Texas Supreme Court said that they follow the same standard as the federal court? Haven't they said that? "}, {"speaker": "Marc A.

Hearron", "text": " They are, but the Texas court has -- the Texas Supreme Court has never addressed a law like S.B. 8.   And, clearly, the legislature thought that it could create standing by creating a cause of action and -- and give everyone an injury.

It is the -- the -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, counsel, the matters that you're talking about now, they're essential to your argument, right?

Hearron", "text": " I think not in the way that S.B. 8 is structured.   I mean, if there is review from this Court holding that the law is unconstitutional, that would be adequate.

First of all, if -- if you win in the trial court, if the state trial court says that the law is unconstitutional, then getting broader relief depends on your opponents appealing that to the intermediate court through the Texas Supreme Court.

It is the chilling effect that is -- that in this case is created by the combination of delegation of -- of enforcement of a public policy to the general public at large, and there's no preclusive effect.

And I'm wondering that for this reason: The statute says that \"A defendant may not establish an undue burden\" -- and this is even assuming that the defendant can satisfy third-party standing rules because the statute says it has to be Craig versus Boren, not the regular abortion third-party standing rules -- but it says that: \"A defendant may not establish an undue burden under this section by\" -- and this is (d)(2) in this section -- \"arguing or attempting to demonstrate that an award of relief against other defendants or other potential defendants will impose an undue burden on women seeking an abortion.\" So I take that to mean that a defendant can only say, an award against me would place a substantial obstacle.   And that's not the full constitutional holding of either Whole Woman's Health or June Medical.   It's looking at the law as a whole and its deterrent effect. Do you read that the same way?

What I'm saying is that even if you have to prove that undue burden defense in every single case, it is -- you -- you -- we wouldn't say -- and if the law -- if the State of Texas had passed a law making it a criminal violation to provide an abortion after six weeks, that there's no problem because you can simply raise undue burden at trial, at your criminal trial. This Court's precedents allow pre-enforcement relief, allow you to come into court and say, I don't need to violate the law in order to first raise my constitutional defenses.   I can come into court under Ex parte Young and Section 1983 and seek a ruling that my -- my constitutional -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Marc A.

"}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Could we talk about Ex parte Young a little bit? You make the point correctly that usually you can get pre-enforcement review in federal court when it's enforced, a law is enforced by a state prosecutor or a state executive official. That's longstanding law. The issue here is different because it's private enforcement in state courts, and that raises a novel issue for us about how to apply Ex parte Young. The Ex parte Young principle is that those who enforce the law can be enjoined or can be sued in pre-enforcement suits in federal court.   But, as Justice Thomas points out, in the two paragraphs at the top of page 163 of Ex parte Young, state courts seem to be carved out from that. So that's the tension.   I think you identified it.   The principle of Ex parte Young versus the language at the top of 163, for me, that's been a real sticking point in trying to sort this out. Now one -- one answer you didn't give is that subsequent law says that when state courts entertain private civil suits, they enforce state law.   And I wanted -- Shelley versus Kraemer being the most prominent landmark example of that. So can you fill in the gaps there and explain to me how we should think about the Ex parte Young language in light of how we conceptualize state court enforcement of private civil suits now? "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   So I think -- I think that the most straightforward way to apply Ex parte Young or to allow relief here under Ex parte Young is against the clerks, as I've said, because that would stop the commencement of the suits and wouldn't create any of the problems raised in Ex parte Young itself about stopping the -- the adjudication. But -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " So I think -- sorry to interrupt -- "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- but I think Justice Thomas's question was also getting at, though -- at -- I take the point distinguish the judges from the clerks.   Are the clerks subsumed within that language in Ex parte Young, and you're saying we shouldn't do that? And I just want to hear your answer why shouldn't we do that. "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " That's right, I don't think so, because that language distinguishes between the power to restrain commencement of suits, which I think that language actually supports relief against the clerks, versus whether courts should restrain a case brought before it.   Now -- which would -- which would mean that that's -- that would refer to the -- the judges here. Now I do think, in subsequent precedent -- decisions of this Court, you're correct, there are -- there are instances where the Court has recognized in Pulliam and in Mitchum where relief against state judges -- and, in fact, Congress recognized in Section 1983, in the text of Section 1983, that judges can be proper defendants, and we've brought that declaratory relief, but I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, it's -- it's more than just that, frankly, because Ex parte Young depends on enforcement.   I think that's the key word.   Well, it turns out in Shelley versus Kraemer the word \"enforcement\" is in there, by my count, 27 times, give or take a couple, to describe what state courts do when they adjudicate private civil suits. "}, {"speaker": "Marc A. Hearron", "text": " That's right, and, in fact, Judge Jackson at a press conference said he's the enforcer of the laws in east Texas.

We know that clerks will docket every S.B. 8 petition that is brought forward. And the state has encouraged and it has incentivized enforcement by offering $10,000 or more bounties, effectively, and by lowering the barriers of entry for people across the state, by allowing anyone to sue without having to show an injury, by allowing them to sue in their home county, and to not have to worry about paying the other side's attorney's fees and even get their own attorney's fees paid.

Texas is a bigger problem than Rhode Island there.   Three, it has no preclusive effect.   Jones 1 sues the clinic.   Clinic wins.   Jones 2 through 4,000 can sue.

Stone, II", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' pursuit of an injunction suffers from two fundamental problems. First, none of the individuals that Petitioners sued are appropriate defendants under well-established Article III and equitable principles. Second, Petitioners ask for an expansion of access to the federal courts that only Congress and not this Court may provide. Petitioners' Article III and equitable problems begin with what they really want, an injunction against S.B. 8, the law, itself. They can't receive that because federal courts don't issue injunctions against laws but against an -- but against officials enforcing laws.   No Texas executive official enforces S.B. 8 either, and so no Texas executive official may be enjoined. Petitioners then turned to state court judges and state court clerks and, apparently, in this Court, now narrow their focus to state court clerks.   But even they don't suggest that either judges or clerks act unlawfully in the ordinary course by adjudicating a case or receiving a complaint.   So Petitioners' harms are not fairly traceable to any unlawfully -- to any allegedly unlawful behavior by state court judges or clerks. And this Court recognized in Ex parte Young itself that such an injunction would be a violation of the whole scheme of our government. State judges are presumed to faithfully apply federal law and this Court's decisions.   If they do not, this Court may exercise appellate review.   That is exactly how federal constitutional defenses are presented and adjudicated all the time. If Congress believes it needs to expand access to the lower federal courts in order to protect Petitioners' rights, then that is a matter for Congress, not a basis to alter -- to alter bedrock doctrines organizing the federal courts. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mr. Stone, the -- why wouldn't you consider the S.B. 8 plaintiffs to be sort of private attorneys general?

It's a private matter.   There is no requirement here that there be an injury to the plaintiff. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Your Honor, the Texas Supreme Court has followed Article III requirements in -- in terms of injury in fact that doesn't need to appear on the face of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So what would that injury be in this -- under S.B. 8 if it's an injury in fact? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " One example could be akin to the injury suffered in the tort of outrage, where an individual becomes aware of a non-compliant abortion and they suffer the sort of same extreme emotional harm.   That would ground an Article III injury for purposes of Texas law that would be sufficient to satisfy the Texas Article III-style screen that addresses some of my friend's on the other side's concerns about an unlimited set of lawsuits or that anyone could possibly bring an S.B. 8 action. Congress passes laws all the time that don't expressly require that individuals show, for example, their own personal injury or traceability or redressability.   But, nonetheless, this Court says those are fundamental requirements of Article III.   And the Texas Supreme Court traces that same requirement to its own constitutional analog, the open courts provision. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " But I -- I -- forgive me, but I don't recall an outrage injury.   What would that be? You said extreme outrage, that would be the injury. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E.

That's how it works -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Give me an example of that. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " An individual discovers that -- that someone -- that a close friend of theirs who they'd spoken with about -- about pro-life issues and about abortion has chosen instead to have a late-term abortion in violation of S.B. 8, and they were very invested in the -- basically, in that child's upbringing and the child's coming into being. To the extent to which there's going to have to be a tighter nexus or what -- what's a sufficient injury in fact is going to be something that the Texas courts have to develop in the first instance.   And, of course, there's going to be some -- there's going to be some tether between a real-world -- not just an offense but sort of grievous offense that we underline -- that we understand underlies IIED as a tort and still nonetheless has a real-world -- a real-world harm.

Stone, II", "text": " No, Your Honor, because that wouldn't affect either the Article III or sovereign immunity problems inherent in this case.   Undoubtedly, it would increase the chill the same way that individuals who are exercising their protected or arguably protected conduct in a -- in a host of -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But, as I understand it, the -- the only way in which you get federal court review is, of course, for somebody to take action that violates the state law and then be sued under the law and then have the opportunity to raise their defense in federal court eventually.

"}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " That's not what I'm saying at all, Your Honor.   What I'm saying is it doesn't expand access to the federal courts. There is still pre-enforcement review I might note.   There are currently 14 pre-enforcement review challenges pending in a multi-district litigation in Travis County's state court. So, to speak to specifically your concern about federal court pre-enforcement access, no, that wouldn't change the Article III or sovereign immunity doctrines in play here. And that might very well be a reason why Congress could be moved to expand access to the federal courts either through the ordinary course or by using their Section 5 powers under the Fourteenth Amendment. But even if the -- the -- the amount of the sanction, again, I agree with you, a million dollars would be tremendous, we could increase it further, no number would suddenly cause the federal courts to become more open. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It's not a question of the federal courts being more open. It's a question of anybody having the capacity or ability to go to the federal court, because nobody is going to risk violating the statute because they'll be subject to suit for a million dollars.

Stone, II", "text": " Well, Your Honor, individuals -- again, to the extent that we're dealing with the sorts of very high-stakes prohibited conduct, fines, sanctions, et cetera -- I might add this is specifically a damages action -- it is capped at much less than that.

Stone, II", "text": " Of course, Mr. Chief Justice.   But, nonetheless, an individual facing extreme sanctions still nonetheless often has to go through state court systems to vindicate their -- their federal rights. Individuals are charged with possessions of firearms in states like Illinois and New York, and they face multiple-year incarceration stints as a possibility of trying to exercise their Second Amendment rights. It is, in fact, the case that constitutional rights are litigated right now with very severe potential sanctions for going through the state courts and with no ability to go to the federal courts before essentially that pre-criminal process ends. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Why -- why does the S.B. 8 allow plaintiffs suing abortion providers to sue anywhere in the state? That's not the normal way venue works in Texas, is it? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " It's not, Your Honor. And, undoubtedly, there are a variety of individual -- a handful of individual procedural rules inherent to S.B. 8 that are designed to favor this cause of action, the same way that there are some designed to favor causes of action like bringing a suit under the antitrust laws or under 1983. Happy to stipulate to that.   But those, to the extent that they became extraordinary, if anything, might sound in a procedural due process claim, which my friends here aren't bringing.   They're bringing a substantive due process claim to S.B. 8 and its liability itself, and they're attempting to cash that out through some form of enforcement against, well, first, Texas officials and then the court clerks and so on and so on. I might point out, turning specifically to the assertions my friend on the other side has said regarding court clerks, that it's actually not even clear that injunctive relief against a court clerk would give him what he wants because, under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 22, a petition is deemed filed upon receipt by the clerk.

I do think the union would be imperiled if we could not make that declaration as to the laws of the states.\" All right? Keep that in mind. Now Holmes was on the Court for Ex parte Young.   That Court said: \"To await proceedings against the company\" -- which is the equivalent of the clinics and the women here -- \"in a state court and then obtain review in this Court would place the company\" -- i.e., women and clinics -- \"in peril of large risk and its agents in great risk of fine and imprisonment,\" which you've just heard, the equivalent.   \"This risk, the company, ought not to be required to take.\" Now why doesn't Holmes' statement, in your opinion, illustrate what is the underlying problem here, generally speaking, and why doesn't Ex parte Young point the way towards, not precisely but point the way towards, an answer? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Two points, Justice Breyer, the latter being what you're describing would be something of an expansion of Ex parte Young, as I think even my friends on the other side concede, as this Court noted that an injunction against the courts themselves through the Ex parte Young device would have been a violation of our whole scheme of government. Well, this Court, in Grupo Mexicano, said, specifically speaking about an expansion from a post -- a post-judgment creditor's ability to distraint a debtor's assets, moving to a pre-judgment creditor's ability to do so, that was simply too great of a novel equitable innovation for this Court to be able to permit itself to essentially innovate.

And the fact that after, oh, these many years, some geniuses came up with a way to evade the commands of that decision, as well as the command that the broader -- the even broader principle that states are not to nullify federal constitutional rights and to say, oh, we've never seen this before, so we can't do anything about it, I -- I -- I guess I just don't understand the argument. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Let me speak to the latter point that you're raising, Justice Kagan, first and then turning back to the Ex parte one -- Young one. This statute on its own terms specifically incorporates as a matter of state law the undue burden defense as articulated by this Court in Casey and subsequent cases. Now there have been some previous questions regarding whether or not it has incorporated that in every -- in every particular regard. There is a separate provision of the very -- of that law that specifically says that nothing in the section is -- basically prohibits individuals from asserting their constitutional rights. And so, to the extent that the Texas legislature has either imperfectly or in an incomplete way recorded as a matter of state law this Court's -- this Court's recognition of the Casey right, individuals may still erect that right fully and completely. Nothing in this law even pretends that Texas courts could evade that because it can't. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Judd E.

If you had somebody who was counseling someone to get an abortion, say, and then was prosecuted -- or was sued, sorry, not prosecuted, under this law, that they could say, I have a First Amendment right to free speech, and so it would be unconstitutional. I didn't take that particular portion of the law to mean that they could assert third-party rights. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " We're speaking about two different portions of the law, Justice Barrett. There is a portion that says something very closely tracking what you said.   There's also Subsection F, which says that nothing in this section shall in any way prohibit, limit, preclude a defendant from asserting that defendant's personal constitutional rights as a defense and so on and so forth. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Aren't personal constitutional rights not third-party rights, and so the clinic's personal rights would differ from the rights of the woman who's the rights holder?

Now it may be the case that those three provisions don't perfectly line up and by -- by interpretive forces that at some point a third-party right that's recognized by this Court can't be perfectly raised as a state law defense. If so, as in all cases, an individual can raise that particular piece or the entire case as a federal constitutional right, that as a default, state court judges who swear an oath to the Constitution, just the way that the Justices on this Court and the lower federal courts do, are presumed that they will apply in good faith, and they are always subject to correction by this Court in any appropriate case. What can't occur is what couldn't occur in, for example, New York Times versus Sullivan or, for that matter, Masterpiece Cakeshop.   An individual there who thinks that they're going to be subjected to a state court process that's either going to be very difficult for them or otherwise unfair to them in terms of the merits of the decision is not permitted to go to a lower federal court and seek functionally an injunction against the state's trial courts when -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

I mean, you look at the history of that case, it was an extraordinary controversy in the United States and in Minnesota about the federal court review, and that itself didn't exist before Ex parte Young. In other words, that was an extension of preexisting doctrine to recognize a problem that the Chief Justice was identifying with deprivation of constitutional rights and chilling on the ability to get judicial review. So Ex parte Young sets out this principle that you can get pre-enforcement review in federal court against state enforcement of laws that are assertedly unconstitutional.   And 999 times out of a thousand or maybe every time until this case, that's a state executive official.   It's a pro forma exercise usually to identify the state executive official. And Justice Kagan points out there's a loophole that's been exploited here or used here, which is the private suits are enforced by state court clerks or judges.   So the question becomes, should we extend the principle of Ex parte Young to, in essence, close that loophole? In other words, put aside the language in Ex parte Young for a second, and that is strong for you, I agree, but the principle of Ex parte Young and the whole sweep of Ex parte Young would suggest extending the principle here, arguably.

It's the nature that potentially later down the line that S.B. 8 case might, in fact, be adjudicated negatively against them.   A state court clerk -- a state court clerk who receives petitions and puts them on the docket and a state court judge who is required to apply this Court's precedents and -- and everything else, they're not Article III adversaries when they're doing that process.

It has some direct enforcement authority with regard to S.B. 8's fee-shifting provision concerning any legal challenge to any abortion restriction or regulation and may also have some constitutional authority under Texas law to enforce Texas law.

So, if every private citizen here has been deputized by the state to enforce this law for the bounty, then why wouldn't an injunction against the AG bar those citizens from going into court just the way it would bar attorney -- district attorneys or police officers from arresting people once that order has been issued or district attorneys from prosecuting those people for a violation of the law that a court has found unconstitutional and tell the attorney general, the representative of the state, is not legal?

The -- the reason that we're sort of -- the hypos that I'm -- I'm pushing back against here are that the United -- that the attorney general simply doesn't have any control of the procession of S.B. 8 lawsuits in any way. He doesn't have a mechanism such as in the qui tam context to take over -- over the litigation. He can't certify that a lawsuit is not in the state's interests or something on that order and order it dismissed.   He has none of those sorts of mechanisms whatsoever. Because of that, that can't possibly at a minimum redress the injuries of the Petitioners unless this Court were to say that private individuals who have not yet articulated they plan to bring suits or anything like that are somehow agents who are acting in concert with the attorney general. The problem with that is that, again, we have no authority over them.   The basic concept of agency is that there is a principal and an agent and the agent is responsible to the principal. The principal in this hypothetical, the attorney general, exercises no supervisory authority whatsoever over putative -- putative suit bringers.   And we're not acting in concert for the ordinary factual reason that, in fact, we're not being approached.

Why would I be looking to a history that can't exist by its very nature? What does exist are the words we said in Ex parte Young, which was we are charged by Congress in ensuring that federal rights are respected directly or indirectly.

A $10,000 liquidated damages provision and potentially a fee-shifting mechanism on top of it is comparatively mild compared to, again, incarceration for asserting a Second Amendment right. I mean, realistically, none of the complaints about the -- about the plaintiff-favoring procedural rules in S.B. 8 would amount to anything even considering a procedural due process violation if this law were about making widgets.

Those 14 pending state court proceedings, any relief would be against only those defendants who were sued in those proceedings.   The private defendants, they're not the state. And, in fact, the -- the defendants there were acting strategically in order to preclude any broader review.   They have now stipulated to temporary injunctions in order to -- to prevent an injunction that might then get appealed and get broader relief from the higher courts. And the other -- the other point about all of this is -- and this is another special feature of S.B. 8, which is that normally in Texas law, Texas has a declaratory judgment act that allows citizens to sue the -- the State of Texas or a -- or the state agency under the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act to get that broader relief.   And -- and in S.B. 8, in Section 171.211, S.B. 8 overrides the state declaratory judgment act and reasserts sovereign immunity to prevent exactly that kind of lawsuit against the state to seek broader review in state courts. On -- on the concern about post-viability abortions, I don't think that that's a concern for the Court, partly because the -- the Petitioners do not provide post-viability abortions.   And under this Court's precedent in Whole Woman's Health, that doesn't preclude a statute from being declared facially unconstitutional.   So I don't think that that's a concern that the Court needs to -- to -- to deal with. But, at the end of the day, what my -- what the State of Texas and what my friends on the other side are saying is that clinics should just violate the law.   They should go out there, they should go about business as usual and subject themselves to the risk that they will be forced to close their doors. But I want to make clear, Your Honors, that this is not just a decision for clinics to make.   Even if clinics and health centers decided to violate the law, they may not find physicians, nurses, ultrasound technicians, staff members willing to work behind the desk because this law targets all of them. Every single person would have to make the decision, am I willing to subject myself to the risk that I -- of $10,000 or more, it's a minimum liability per abortion, plus the risk that I'm going to be haled into suits all across the state and I'm going to have my -- my ability to have an attorney taken away from me because my attorney may have to pay attorney's fees? Every single person, and that's exactly what this Court addressed in Ex parte Young.   Ex parte Young and the reason the principles underlying Ex parte Young support relief here is one of the things that it said is that -- that the railroad may not be able to find an agent or an employee even willing to violate the law to -- to generate a test case. And so, Your Honor, for all the reasons that we've stated, we think the principles of -- of Ex parte Young support relief here, and we ask that the district court's decision be affirmed.
