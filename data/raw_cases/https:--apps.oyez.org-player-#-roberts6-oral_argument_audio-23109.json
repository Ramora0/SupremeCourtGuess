[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 10-704, Messerschmidt v. Millender.   Mr. Coates. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   In Malley v. Briggs and United States v. Leon, this Court set forth a very high standard for denying qualified immunity in the civil context or suppressing evidence in the criminal context under circumstances where a police officer has procured a warrant that is subsequently determined to be invalid.   Specifically, the Court held that the initial magistrate's determination is -- is entitled to great deference, and that you will go behind that only in cases where the officer falsified information or omitted exculpatory information, where the affidavit was bare-bones, or there was some indication that the judicial officer did not perform the function, and then a catch-all provision, where the warrant was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that no reasonable officer could even submit it for a magistrate's determination.   And specifically in Malley, the Court said it had to be the actions of an officer that was plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law.   This case arises from a Ninth Circuit decision that we submit does not apply the Court's standards, under circumstances where the officer submitted, far from a bare-bones affidavit, but a highly detailed, factual affidavit that we submit provided probable cause for the search or at least, under the Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, a reasonable officer could believe that the warrant had probable cause. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " There -- I suppose one new feature of the case is the fact that these officers submitted the affidavit to their superiors, who were -- were attorneys. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Correct.   There-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Have we addressed that in a prior case? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --I don't know that the Court -- the Court has -- in I believe the exclusion context I think I have seen it.   I can't recall the case, but I believe it has, and the circuit courts certainly have talked about that, as an indicia of good faith, the officer being willing to submit his work to someone else to review it.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But it isn't good faith here, that's the problem.   We don't have a good faith test, we -- we have a test that goes beyond good faith.   Even if the officer is in good faith, according to the test we have set forth, if he's so stupid that -- that he -- he executes a warrant that no reasonable officer could think was correct, he's -- he's in the pot, right? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Well, that -- that's the test that the Court has set out.   But it's a high test, plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law.   And I think these are additional factual circumstances that show at least the officer is trying to be careful, that this isn't something that's been -- been tossed off. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, I thought in the Leon case that in fact, just like the claim in this case, that the affidavit was submitted to supervisors and the Court created the Leon test in spite of that.   So to say that we have a case on point, Leon itself is on point.   We created the test in the face supervisor's review.   You are not actually, are you, arguing a Nuremberg defense now? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " No.   I'm just saying that-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That -- that simply because supervisors decide that it's okay, that that-- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --No. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --exculpates someone from responsibility? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Certainly not.   And as I say, this comes up in the qualified immunity context repeatedly among the circuit courts.   They've recognize it as a -- as a factor.   But it is not dispositive, not by any means.   I agree with -- I agree with that, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   Then let's go to the other two ways that I think you are asking us to overrule our precedent.   The first is using subjective information that a police officer knows, but hasn't disclosed in the warrant.   I'm having a little bit of difficulty understanding how an entire warrant regime that presumes that the magistrate has all pertinent information, and that's why you would be let off the hook, how you can excuse a police officer when he doesn't place that information in front of the magistrate? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " The way that has generally come up has not been in the validity of the warrant for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, but in terms of qualified immunity for the officer or exclusion of the evidence under -- or not -- or nonsuppression, rather, under the good faith exception.   And it's whether the officer, in light of the totality of the circumstances, might not have recognized that the warrant was deficient if the warrant otherwise isn't -- isn't bare-bones.   And I think -- Leon itself in footnote 23 incorporates the Harlow standard of totality of circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Tell me how, this case, the bare-bone affidavit was sufficient?   All it says is that this defendant is a member of a gang, but when the police officer is questioned, he is asked whether this crime at issue had any connection to his gang relationship and the answer was no.   So how is the request of the warrant to search for all gang-related indicia anything more than the general warrant that our Founding Fathers in part passed the Fourth Amendment against? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Oh, I mean, this is not per se a gang crime. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " This is almost like-- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Without a -- without a doubt, it's not a what we consider a gangland crime, of one gang member against the other.   It's a domestic assault by a gang member on his girlfriend with a sawed-off shotgun in public, right after police officers that were there to protect her had left.   So it's not gang-related in that sense.   But I don't think that the gang membership is irrelevant to the investigation in this case.   You know, as we note and I think it is fairly recognized, gang members have the means to procure and use weapons beyond that of ordinary people. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So if you have a gang member and the crime has absolutely nothing to do with gang membership -- that I think is the case here; it's a domestic assault -- as long as you are a gang member, than every warrant can say \"search for all gang-related information\"?   That's essentially your position, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " No, it isn't, because it's always a fact-specific inquiry.   The courts made that clear in Illinois v. Gates and for qualified immunity in Anderson v. Creighton.   We're-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But you -- you said this is domestic assault.   There is no gang activity involved in that assault, right? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Well, the gentleman is using a sawed-off shotgun, which is a weapon associated with -- with gangs.   I don't think it's a stretch for an officer to think that there might be some connection to the manner in which he procured that weapon, might hide that weapon-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So anyone who has a weapon and is a member of a gang then can be -- there can be a search for any and all weapons and material related to weapons? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Well, it depends on the circumstances of the crime that you are investigating.   Here we have an assault, we have a domestic assault with indications that the gentleman intends to continue it.   And indeed that's why the warrant is for all weapons; because it would make little sense to say you can go and you could find a sawed-off shotgun-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I'm on to the part about all gang-related activities, when the crime has nothing to do with the -- with the gang.   Let's -- let's stick to that.   Then there is another issue.   But this said warrant to search for any and all gang-related items? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Correct, Your Honor.   But the point is that's to be used to possibly tie Mr. Bowen to any weapon that was found.   It's identification information.   If they found, for example, the sawed-off shotgun there and his gang colors with his gang moniker, that would certainly help to tie him to that shotgun. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But they didn't need to tie him to the shotgun.   They had photographs of him with the shotgun. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " They have some evidence, but you don't have to stop just because you have some evidence.   I mean, you are entitled to build your case as strong as you-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What -- what do you need more than here he is, with his gun, the defendant himself and his gun?   I mean, what-- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Well, if you found the actual shotgun there wrapped in his -- in his gang -- gang colors with his gang moniker, I mean, it would make an even stronger case.   And I also note, say you find a.   45-caliber pistol wrapped in his gang colors with his gang moniker.   I don't think-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --What do we do with the officer's testimony when he said,   \"Did you have any reason to believe there were any more weapons in the house? \"   He said, \"No\".   What -- when an officer says that, why would then he think that he has complete license to go and ask for a warrant that's looking for more guns, when there is only evidence of him possessing one? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Because, again, the nature of gang membership is that gangs-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you are answering -- you are answering Justice Ginsburg by saying that any time a gang member commits any crime, the police are entitled to seek a warrant that permits the search for anything they have in their home that relates to their gang membership and to -- to guns? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --No, because I think it depends.   Here we have a crime that definitely involves a gun, involves an illegal gun-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That did not involve -- by the officer's admission and your own, that wasn't gang-related. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --The assault, correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The assault-- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " But the manner in which he procures the weapon, might dispose of the weapon, the nature of the weapon itself. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --But wait a minute.   That has nothing to do with the gang, unless you are saying that you had proof that the gang did something illegally in helping him procure the weapon.   What information did you have to suggest that? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Again, the nature of a sawed-off shotgun; it's an illegal weapon in and of itself. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Whose house -- whose house was this? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Augusta Millender's house, Ms. Millender's home. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It was not the defendant's house? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T.

Breyer", "text": " --To what extent are we supposed to take things that aren't in the affidavit or the warrant itself as relevant?   I mean, the only thing that bothers me as I read the affidavit, it doesn't say someone else is living in the house.   At least I didn't see that.   And then the statement of Justice Sotomayor said: Well, that's later on in a deposition.   So -- so if I were the magistrate sitting there and I read the -- the affidavit, I might think I did have cause, At least it's close, maybe, to allow them to search for all the guns in the house.   I might think they all belong to him.   And anyway, I might think he thought that this could be used to -- other guns could be used to go after her again.   But when I read, he says: Oh, I had no cause at all for thinking that.   Why isn't that the end of it, if we're supposed to take that into account. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Well, I mean, again, I think, as he sets forth his experience as a gang officer, and the manner in which gangs dispose of, procure weapons-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " He didn't say much about the gang. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --No. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm asking you a specific question.   I mean if I were supposed to take into account his statement, I had no reason -- to paraphrase it a little -- thinking that any of these guns, other guns, were going to be used for any purpose that's illegal -- if he'd said that afterwards, if I take that into account, I say, why isn't that the end of the case?   He has no cause to ask for the other guns, period. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now that was the question, I think roughly, that you were being asked and I would like to hear the answer.   I thought the answer would be: I don't have the right to take it into account.   Now, do I or don't I? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Well, I mean, it's an -- it's an objective standard.   It's what a reasonable officer would do with the facts before him. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Wait.   Before him? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Or before the -- do I look at the affidavits and the warrant, or do I also look at things that are in neither of those documents, but were in the officer's head? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " For purposes of determining the Fourth Amendment validity of the warrant, the Court has said you -- you look at the warrant.   Under the qualified immunity test and in the criminal suppression context of good faith, you can go outside that and look at the totality of what the officer knew, and if in light of what he knew whether he could have believed it was so. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So if I look at whether he was in good faith, if he has any training at all, I would guess that if he thought that there is no -- I don't remember the exact words -- no reason, no reason to believe there would be any weapons in the house, no reason to believe there would be any handguns in the house, and then I say, I want a warrant to search for handguns in the house, it looks like you are asking for a warrant to search for that for which you have no reason to believe it's there.   Now, that I would have thought was not good faith.   That was contrary to the Fourth Amendment.   Why isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Because you -- you still have under 1524(a)(3) of the California Penal Code the -- the ability to search for items that might be used with the intent to commit another crime.   And I think if this was-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Even though you can search a person's house -- why don't I search the person's house for an atomic bomb?   And I say: Why are you doing that?   He says: I have no reason to believe it's there.   But that is a constitutional search? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Well, again I think -- going back here in terms of -- stepping back from good faith as opposed to probable cause, I don't think it's irrelevant that this guy is a gang member.   I don't think it's unusual to think that, while you might know specifically whether there's a handgun or not-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me.   Why are you going back to good faith?   I mean-- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --That's -- that is what I think is the problem with this case.   If it's a good faith test, you come out with one result.   But the test we have expressed is not good faith.   This -- this police officer could have been in the best of faith, but if he's a very bad police officer he's in the soup, right? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " We don't have a good faith test for this purpose. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Sure.   But a -- but the standard is plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law, and I think -- again, there is enough detail in there that I don't think it is illogical to say there is some connection between gang membership and the possibility or even the fair probability that there are other weapons in a residence. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Of course-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So when -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --I was just going to say, of course you are making the case somewhat harder for yourself because the issue here is whether it was reasonable for him to say, let me check and see what my superiors say about this, and then after that review for him to say, let's see what the magistrate thinks about this, right? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Correct.   It's a -- it's a further step back, because whether it's even reasonable for him to ask the magistrate for a determination-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

He didn't make -- specify, in terms of his threat, that he was confining his further attack to a sawed off shotgun.   I just don't think it's a stretch of logic for an officer to believe that if he found a.45-caliber pistol there wrapped in gang colors that he should be able to seize it to prevent-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But the warrant didn't just authorize, you know, firearms wrapped in gang colors.   It lets him search for any evidence of gang membership, right? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What possible purpose could that serve? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T.

It's not relevant to that-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But they knew he was in that premises, I mean that -- I really don't understand how you can possibly search for indicia of gang membership when you know the man's a gang member, so what? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --Well, again, Your Honor, it ties him closer.   It shows him them at the property. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --But tell me something.   There is ten people in this house.   There is ten people in this house and as I understand it from the questioning, they also knew other gang members were there.   So even if they found gang colors, did they tell the manufacturer or the magistrate that -- what would that prove when there is multiple members in the house. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Well, you could find again, gang member -- indicia gang membership as to him. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, he admitted to that. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " Well, correct.   And he is also a member of several gangs, so you could find unique colors for one of his gangs and not for the other.

Again, if you found a.45 caliber pistol-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --What about a provision for any photographs that depict evidence of criminal activity?   That seems to me as general as you can get.   Photographs depicting evidence of criminal activity. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " --That actually is in the section that deals with indicia of gang membership.   It has been carved out by Respondents for the first time as a separate category.   I note it was not argued down below that way, it was not viewed at the district court that way and it was not viewed by the circuit judges that way.   And I do have to say that we're sitting here looking at 11 judges and like 6 attorneys have looked at this and they have never brought that out separately.   And now we are saying that should have jumped out to the officer's separately.   I think we cite case law saying that you should interpret that within the context of the entire provision which is the indicia of gang membership provision.   And if I may, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Counsel.   Mr. Srinivasan. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   When an officer follows the favored practice under the Fourth Amendment of obtaining a warrant from a neutral magistrate before conducting a search, the officer in all but the most narrow circumstances can rely on the magistrate's independent determination of probable cause. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Srinivasan, there are two categories of materials here, one is the search for other guns and the other is the search for anything relating to gang membership.   If we think that those two categories present different questions, if we think that one is more beyond a balance than another, that an officer might have qualified immunity from let's say the guns but not the evidence of gang membership, what would happen in this case at that point? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Well, I think one of the questions that would arise is whether the one as to which you thought there was a problem would expand the scope in a meaningful way.   Because if -- let's take Your Honor's hypothesis that there is less of a reason to be concerned about the firearms related aspects of the warrant than the gang related parts of the warrant, then the question would arise whether you would have a Fourth Amendment violation in the first place.   Because if the gang related parts of the warrant didn't expand the scope of the search in such a way that would implicate independent privacy interest, there wouldn't be a Fourth Amendment problem with that aspect of the warrant and therefore you wouldn't have the qualified immunity issue for sure. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What does that depend on, whether you would look for the indicia of gang memberships in places where you wouldn't look for guns, is that it? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " That's right.   You look at the two aspects of the warrant and you ask whether the second one which is hypothetical to be the problematic one would allow you to search in places or search with more intensity than the first-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, if you are looking for photographs that show gang membership, I guess you could look through photograph albums, you wouldn't really look there for guns, would you? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --Well, but no.   I think the relevant is page 52 of the Joint Appendix.   That is what sets fourth the two paragraphs at issue.   And the first paragraph which Justice Kagan supposes doesn't raise a problem and I'll -- to that assumption.   It provides not only for searches of all firearms, but it provides and we think legitimately for searches of any receipts or paperwork showing the purchase, ownership or possession of the guns being sought.   And so it -- and paperwork certainly includes photographs.   Because if you find photographs of an individual carrying a particular firearm, that's good evidence.   So photographic evidence is within the scope of the first paragraph not just the second.   And so it does raise the question of whether the second paragraph increases the scope.   The other point I would raise in this respect is that in the second paragraph itself the anchor sentence in some respects in the second paragraph is the second sentence, which discusses not gang related indicia in particular but articles of personal property tending to establish the identity of persons and control of their premise or premises writ large.   And that provision has not been seen to have a problem associated with it thus far.   The district court thought it was okay.   The Court of Appeals at page 27(a) of the petition appendix seemed to assume it was okay.   And that's understandable because there are a legion of cases that support those sorts of provisions, including the Ewing case cited by the majority below. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " There is something very strange about the rule we are applying here.   A warrant was issued by a judge in the Superior Court, isn't that right. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Yes, I believe so. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And -- and so that judge, who is a lawyer and was appointed as a judge and presumably has some familiarity with the Fourth Amendment, found that there was probable cause to search for all of these things.   And now we are asking whether a reasonable police officer who is not a lawyer and certainly is not a judge should have been able to see that this call that was made by a judge was not only wrong but so wrong that it -- you couldn't reasonably think that the judge might be correct.   Is there some way to phrase this, if this rule is to be retained in any form, is there some way to phrase it so that it is narrowed appropriately? "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Well, I -- I think the court has attempted to do that in Malley and Leon itself, because it has made clear that in the main, in all but the most narrow circumstances where a magistrate does find the existence of probable cause, the court need not engage in any searching inquiry to determine the qualified immunity is appropriate. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But the most narrow circumstance is defined as a circumstance in which no reasonable police officer could have thought the warrant was correct.   Why don't we adopt a good faith test for this as we do in other -- in other-- "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " Well, I think in some sense, Justice Scalia, you have two, in response, two parts of your question.   First of all in defining what is objectively unreasonable in this situation, the court has used some pretty strong language.   In Malley it spoke in terms of a magistrate who is grossly incompetent.   And in Leon it spoke of-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --Policeman.   Policeman. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --No, it was speaking of a magistrate actually, not the officers.   Because the point in order to find the officers are liable in this situation, the officers would have to be so sure that probable cause is lacking that only a grossly incompetent magistrate could sign off on the probable cause assessment.   So it used gross incompetence with respect to the magistrate which illustrates the degree to which the standard is heightened in this context.   And in terms of whether the good faith principles come into play in the qualified immunity context, what the courts said in Malley is that the same standard of objective reasoning -- of reasonableness that governs in the good faith context for suppression purposes also governs in the qualified immunity context in 1983.   And so I think there is room to import into the qualified immunity context these principles of good faith like for example, Mr. Chief Justice, the question of whether the officers in question asked superiors for their assessment of whether there is probable cause.   And in Sheppard, which was a suppression case, but in Sheppard at page 98 and 9 of the opinion the court specifically made reference to the fact that the officer in that case had asked for a probable cause-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, I don't like this mishmash.   Look, it's either good faith or it's -- however good his faith was, however well he showed his good faith by checking with his superiors or what not, if he -- if he made an incompetent decision it's incompetent.   And we should not mix the two, it seems to me. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --Well that, I mean certainly I don't want to urge anything upon the Court that would tend to water down the standard in the suppression context, but the only point I would add to this, Justice Scalia, is that when you are looking at it from the perspective of a reasonable officer who is trying to assess whether he should go forward and ask for assessment of probably cause from the magistrate, one consideration that seems natural to take into account is what actions the officer has taken, not just the quantum of proof that the officer has put in the affidavit but what actions has he taken.   Has he asked for-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " That would be wonderful if the test was, was this -- did this officer know that this was a bad affidavit and was acting in bad faith in executing it?   If that was the test, then indeed the fact that he had checked with his superiors and all that good stuff would have some relevance. "}, {"speaker": "Sri Srinivasan", "text": " --The test as outlined by the Court in Malley is whether it's subjectively reasonable for the officer to rely on the magistrate's judgment of probable cause.

Then, as to whether they are likely to be in the house, well, we know this: we know he has a sawed-off shotgun, and we know he is a member of a gang, which is defined as a group of people engaged in definable criminal activity, creating an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.   So people like that have guns.   And when -- where they live, there may well be other guns.

So I don't think -- I mean, the district attorney and the superior are on the same crime-fighting team as the -- as the -- as Detective Messerschmidt in this case.   Also, we really -- we have no information about what transpired in these conversations with the deputy district attorney.

This Court has actually never explicitly endorsed the severance doctrine, and that is the question that suppose you have a warrant that is sort of half valid and half invalid; or maybe half arguably valid but half totally, you know, totally valid.   What do you do then?

"}, {"speaker": "Paul Rq Wolfson", "text": " Respectfully, Justice Kagan, I don't think I agree, and I think that it's -- it's useful to look at two related but somewhat different lines of cases, particularly in the Ninth Circuit, but actually, you know, all across the board in the courts of appeals.   The first line of cases says if the police have reason, or have probable cause to look for a specific object, or specific -- even a specific kind of object, that doesn't give them probable cause to look for the whole generic class of objects that are somewhat similar.   The leading case on this in the Ninth Circuit is the Spilotro decision, but there are many cases coming both before and after that stand for that proposition.   The -- the principle has been applied in many contexts.   For example, if you think somebody is committing fraud for years 1998 and 1999, and there are billing records, you can't -- you don't have probable cause to look for fraud, you know, for the entire records, billing records from 1950 to the present.   If you think that -- if you see somebody run over somebody else in a green Nissan Sentra, you don't have probable cause to search for all vehicles including a red Ford -- a red Ford Explorer.   This is really that principle in the context of firearms.   And it -- and Detective Messerschmidt had the information that the case involved a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip.   Now there certainly are cases-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, to come back to a question that was asked before-- "}, {"speaker": "Paul Rq Wolfson", "text": " --Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " --suppose they were issuing -- suppose the warrant just sought this -- the -- that particular weapon.   They execute it, and they come to a room in this house and it's got Mr. Bowen's name on it, and inside there is a gun cabinet and there are -- there's -- there are a whole -- there is a whole array of guns, legal -- let's say he legally possesses them.   There's a -- there's a -- these are assault rifles, there are pistols; and it's known that he's threatened to kill his girlfriend.   You say -- would the police be able to seize those?

They took them under the authority of the warrant.   They did not provide an explanation as to specifically why they were -- why the gun was seized, but the gun was seized.   And this -- I think that's really the -- this point, that they went into the Millenders' house, searched the house from top to bottom, and seized the Millenders' -- Mrs. Millender's lawfully owned weapon really shows that this case is in the heartland of what the Fourth Amendment is concerned about.

When -- especially when you combine that with all the other information that Detective Messerschmidt actually obtained from the printouts of the databases which are in the JA, which in fact say that he hadn't been at the 120th Street address for several months and his most recent address was 97th Street where he lived with -- where he stayed with, at least sometimes, Shelley Kelly and gave it out as his address.   So that -- that is in respects why we think this is materially misleading.   Of course, we were not allowed to appeal that determination.   So that really only half of the case in that respect was before the court of appeals and is before the Court.   Thank you very much. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Coates, you have 2 minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy T. Coates", "text": " With respect to the -- the hypothetical that Justice Alito postulated in terms of finding other weapons there, and Respondents' counsel to say well, we might to on the plain view doctrine, I think these are circumstances in which we note that you want to encourage officers when they can, not to -- not rely on exceptions to the warrant requirement, and here if anything the officers in an abundance of caution attempted to get a warrant, contemplating those precise circumstances.   I don't think they should incur liability for -- for going to that extra step and that extra precaution.   And again, a step back from whether there is actually probable cause, but whether a reasonable officer could even believe that might be the case for purposes of sending it to a magistrate.   I think under those circumstances you want to encourage officers to seek a magistrate's determination and not try and rely on on-the-scene exceptions to the warrant requirement to try and justify seizing weapons under those circumstances.   With respect to Justice Scalia's concern about the probable cause to seize all guns as opposed to guns belonging to Bowen, and I think the notion is that Bowen, being a resident and that being established for purposes of this contention at this point, it's still down at district court but it was assumed for purposes of the Ninth Circuit that he was a resident -- that as a resident that he would have access to that firearm, and I think this was bolstered by a fact, again his status as a gang member, we cite the Chicago Housing Authority v. Rhodes case which talks about the manner in which gang members often store and use weapons at family members' homes.   I mean, it's an unfortunate part of -- of the gang culture, so it's not unreasonable for an officer to think there might be probable cause at the very least to seize any weapon found there, even if ultimately facts developed that it is in fact not Bowen's weapon.   And this also goes to the indicia of gang membership and why it's reasonable even to ask, because that may be one of the means by which we could tie a particular weapon to Bowen depending upon what is found during the search.   This is a very high standard as established by this Court, which is essentially plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law.   And this is an officer that has not hidden the ball with respect to what transpired between Bowen and Kelly.   He submitted it to his superiors to look at; he submitted it to an attorney; and while that is not dispositive, I think those are objective facts that a reasonable officer could say, I have done this, this and this; there is no reason for me to believe that I am violating the law in sending it to a magistrate.
