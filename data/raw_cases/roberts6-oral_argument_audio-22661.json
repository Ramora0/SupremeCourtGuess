"}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   As the government concedes, INA subsection 101(a)(13)(C)(v) added by IIRIRA does not expressly mandate retroactivity.   Under Landgraf, applying that new provision would attach new legal consequences to pre-IIRIRA offenses, penalizing both those who travel and those who don't.   Covered lawful permanent residents could not visit their parents abroad without being forced to abandon their children here.   They would be removed from the country or else confined here.   Either way, they would lose an ability they had under pre-IIRIRA law based on pre-IIRIRA offenses.   Thus applying the subsection to them would be impermissibly retroactive.   The settled expectations at issue here are those of round trips by lawful permanent residents, not, as the government would put it, one-way tickets or first-time entrants.   These are people who have structured their lives here.   They have homes, spouses, children, and careers here, and yet have a settled expectation that they will be able to maintain ties to visit aged and ailing parents abroad, to go to funerals and wakes and visit them in the hospital and surgeries.

So does the government.   You do not cite, the government cites but does not discuss the relevant portion of a -- of a later case which involved the same question, Republic of Austria v. Altmann.   I concurred separately in Landgraf because I thought that the test that the Court was using, upsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper test for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post facto laws, which is where the Court derived it from, Justice Story's opinion in a New Hampshire constitutional case.   But I said in my concurrence that the proper test for -- for the other issue of retroactivity, namely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean to be applied only in the future or in the past?   And for that I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said in Altmann:   \"Our approach\" -- which postdates Landgraf.   \"Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the concurrence in Landgraf. \"   Quote, and it's quoting the concurrence:   \"The critical issue is not whether the rule affects vested rights or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates. \"   \"Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered. \"   \"Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date. \"   \"But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relative retroactivity event. \"   --\"relevant retroactivity event\".   And that is what we have here.   The -- the event that is sought to be regulated is entry into the United States, and it is clear that this statute applies only to prospective entry into the United States.   It doesn't apply to past entry so that those people who came in, in violation of this statute can be deported.   Now, why shouldn't we apply that rule in this case, as we did in the Republic of Austria case? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " No, Your Honor.   As a -- first of all, our reply brief discussed Altmann, and the majority of the Court has viewed that as limited to the foreign sovereign immunity context.   But taking your test-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Why would it be limited just to the foreign sovereign immunities context? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --That -- that's the majority's approach.   But taking your test on its own terms, what you are pointing out is there is a future act-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Why do you say that's the majority's approach? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --I'm sorry.   The majority in Fernandez-Vargas expressly said that Republic of Austria was in a sui generis context and that its holding shouldn't be extended to -- to Fernandez-Vargas. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Its -- its holding. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Yes.   But to take -- to look at your test, you were pointing out that there is a future event which the government, practically its entire theory turns on that.   But even if there is a future event, there is a past event being regulated here, and the activity at issue under your test would be the pre-IIRIRA offense, not just the innocent post-IIRIRA travel.   What we have is future lawful travel, concededly lawful, nothing nefarious needs to be shown of it. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Mr. Bibas, how is it different then from a felon in possession statute, where you look at the past offense-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --and then you say, well, this man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun in the future?   How is it different at all? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Your Honor, there are five pertinent distinctions.   Permit me to unpack.   The first and most important is that the Landgraf test should have a broader scope than the ex post facto context in these criminal cases because Congress can override it expressly.   Since the ex post facto clauses disable both State and Federal legislatures from acting at all, the deprivation of the power must be narrow and careful so State and Federal legislatures can continue to regulate felon in possession or racketeering or the other crimes the government advances.   But Landgraf just tells Congress how to legislate.   It's a background rule.   So it's legitimate to have a presumption against retroactivity sweep more broadly, as Congress is free to override it and, as I will explain, does override it regularly.   Secondly, felon in possession is inherently dangerous conduct.   This is a protective law.   It's not just a punitive or deterrent law.   The third and related point is that felon in possession laws are tailored.   There is a nexus to a danger, a threat to people suffering firearm -- it's narrowly tailored.   Fourth-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, why isn't the -- the government, Congress, making the exact judgment same judgment here?   If the activity to be regulated is entry and Congress is making a judgment that we do not want dangerous people to enter, and we're using the conviction, the prior conviction, as a marker for who was dangerous, and that's exactly what Congress has done in the felon in possession statute. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --Your Honor, I believe the two are quite different.   Felon in possession is limited to firearms in the hands of proven dangerous people.   Here we have a law that says you can stay in the country indefinitely; we are going to discourage you from going abroad and leaving the country, because we will make it harder for you to come back.   That is not tailored at all to protecting the people inside the United States.   I would also point out that the felon in possession statute, as this Court noted in Heller, is part of a long tradition of forbidding such activity as a crime.   So it's hard to say there are settled expectations being upset by felon in possession laws.   And the final one is, Congress can do that simply by being explicit, and it has done so repeatedly in laws such as IIRIRA.   Elsewhere in IIRIRA, section 321(b) says the aggravated felony definition applies to convictions entered before, on or after the statute's effective date.   It knew how to do it; it did it more than a dozen other times in IIRIRA, as this Court noted in St. Cyr.   It didn't spell it out here.   The point of this-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The career criminal enhancements, instead of the felon in possession, and assuming your arguments, what limits can Congress put on anyone with respect to future conduct if it's going to be a burden?   Under your view, it stops people from traveling.   Career criminal statutes put on the distinct disadvantage of a longer sentence. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor, and as we noted in the criminal context, this Court in Witte and Gryger notes, it's a heavier punishment on the new crime because it's aggravated, because it's repeated.   And because Congress has more leeway in the ex post facto context and because recidivism enhancements have a long tradition, it's entirely legitimate.   There's no need to say that that's punishing the past offense because the future offense -- it -- it's permissible to increase it under the Ex Post Facto Clause.   And that's an inquiry that's different from the Landgraf test here, because all Congress has to do is spell out expressly: We want to apply this to convictions entered before, on, or after the statute's effective date, which it did in 321(b), which it didn't do here.   So if we were looking at the function of-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Does that argument that you just made go more to whether or not the BIA's conclusion that Congress intended to rescind the Fleuti decision -- but you assume that's what its intent was? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --We've assumed arguendo because that's the premise of the question presented. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So if we assume that, if we assume that was Congress's intent, doesn't that start give you the conclusion?   If Congress tended to undo it, doesn't that prove that they intended to effective retroactively? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " No, Your Honor, it doesn't.   All the case law, the legislative history, and other discussion was about certain other aspects of entry doctrine that needed to be changed.   The discussion was express about saying: We're changing the definition from entry to admission, because we don't want people who snuck into the country outside of-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, no.   Those go to the basic premise. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --Right.   Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If you assume Congress intended to rescind the prior doctrine, isn't that proof itself that it intended to apply the statute retroactively? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " No, Your Honor-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " To this conduct? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --No, Your Honor.   Congress can intend to rescind -- to abrogate a statute such that it will have no effect going forward.   But as this Court noted in Landgraf, the -- the background default rule that the public and Congress expect is that new laws will apply prospectively.   That has the virtue not only of giving a clear background rule which -- against which Congress legislates, against which it did legislate in IIRIRA, but it also forces Congress to advert to the potential unfairness of retroactivity and decide that the benefits outweigh it.   That's what this Court said in Landgraf.   It makes perfect sense and that clear statement rule serves the function of having them smoke out into the open.   If you think it's beneficial to make this affect convictions in the past, just say so.   But it didn't.   So to go back to our primary point, with the practical impact or effect being a new travel disability, the government's argument seems to boil down to that, because there is one event that must happen after the statute's effective date, therefore there can be no retroactive effect. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, that event is the event that the government cares about, which is the entry into the country.   It's not as though the -- you know, the government says -- just picks an event at random and -- and makes it the trigger mechanism.   The government has picked the event that it wants to regulate, which is entry. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, but this is an effect test, and under Martin v. Hadix and Landgraf, we have to take a commonsense functional view of what the effects are, the new legal consequences.   I-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I would have thought your answer to my colleague would be: No; what they want to regulate is the staying in the country, and they're trying to make that as uncomfortable as possible in order to encourage the individual to leave.   If he can't go to the, you know, the parent's party, the cousin's wedding or whatever, he is just going to leave, and then once he does, he can't come back.   Why would -- why would the government care -- it's a question for them, I'm sure.   Why would they care whether somebody that they don't want to be here stays here?   It seems to me the exact opposite.   So I would have thought your argument -- your answer would be, no, what they are trying to regulate is not the coming and going, but simply the staying. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor, you're right that, particularly given the strange way in which its written, it's hard to understand it as something other than a penalty and possibly a deterrent, but certainly a penalty based on past crimes, to make life uncomfortable.   And that does not speak of a protective, forward-looking exclusive function, if that's the test.   But to go back to the earlier point, if that were -- if we were to follow the approach Justice Scalia outlined, that would be the right response.   But we don't even need to get there because the primary test under Landgraf is not the point or function or purpose, but an effects test.   The effect, as the government concedes, is to force him to choose between his parents in Greece and his wife, children, career, and home here. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But there are a lot of -- but there are a lot of statutes which we interpret to be valid and not retroactive which have a substantial effect.   You can pass a statute altering the rules of evidence which have the effect of making someone who committed a prior murder convictable, whereas before he was not convictable.   And we don't just look to the effect and say, well, it has that substantial effect so it's operating retroactively.   We say, no, it's a rule of evidence that applies in the future and that evidence can come in.   That's the big problem with this other approach.   There are often adverse effects upon activities that occurred before the statute was enacted, but we still regard the statute as prospective only and therefore not subject to special rules for people who are affected. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Well, setting aside the difference between the ex post facto context and the civil context, and there is the procedural distinction, which I know Your Honor didn't sign on to, it's also relevant that here it is directly expressly tied to a past conduct.   It's a precondition.   It's not even a piece of evidence or something one can draw an inference from.   It is a precondition for ineligibility under 101(a)(13)(C)(v).   And therefore it looks like the disability that Justice Story said, a disability has to involve future conduct.   But if it's expressly disabling future conduct, that's a penalty on past conduct.   The disability in St. Cyr of not being able to apply for future discretionary relief.   The disability in some other cases of this Court that we found after briefing and alerted opposing counsel to, Cummings v. Missouri and Ex parte Garland in volume 71 of the U.S. Reports.   Even though the law there forbade teaching in the future or holding office or preaching or being a member of the bar, the government's theory would say: Those are post-enactment things; just refrain from teaching; you don't have a vested right to teach.   This Court said: No; we recognize those are expressly targeted to punish the past membership in the Confederacy that triggers that disability.   And so the government's approach would render the Justice Story's disability category a nullity. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Does it matter in the examples that you just gave that admission to the United States is purely a matter of legislative grace, while we might conclude that teaching, being a member of the bar, whatever, is not? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " I don't believe that that is important.   That only matters for the vested rights argument, and this Court in Cummings said expressly it was dealing with a privilege.   So -- moreover-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I'm sorry?   Which privilege was that? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --The privilege of teaching or the privilege of holding office.   So you can't rest on a right privilege-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I suppose that might have been regarded as such then, but not under current law. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --Okay.   Well, another answer -- in St. Cyr the government made the same argument, and this Court said: Well, sure, Congress has the plenary power to change the rules any time it wants; just do it expressly.   The question is not whether Congress can, but whether it has in fact changed the rules expressly, to make that express tradeoff that the potential unfairness of retroactivity is worth it.   Now, the final point here, I believe there was some reference earlier to reliance in the offense.   And as the government concedes, reliance is not a prerequisite.   This Court can rule for Petitioner and not even bother with reliance.   But the presence of reliance here is an extra factor that supports -- that shows the retroactivity to be obvious and severe.   So the court of appeal's whole premise that reliance is necessary goes away.   The government concedes the court of appeals implicitly was wrong on that.   As a practical matter, our point is that defendants rely on the known consequences of offenses when they decide to plead guilty.   As this Court recognized in-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " When they decide to plead guilty.   The operative issue here is when they commit the crime. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --We don't claim that there is a reliance interest in committing the crime, but in the decision to plead guilty as a practical matter the defendants weigh a number of consequences.   And one of those is whether they might have a 4-month discount off their sentencing guidelines, which was the inducement here, and another one is will they ever be able to see their parents again. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So this -- so this-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " So you draw the line on -- your position is that only those who have entered a guilty plea are entitled to the presumption against -- non-retroactivity, but not those who have been found guilty? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Your Honor, our primary position is that because reliance isn't necessary all of them benefit from it, because they all have settled expectations. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " How do you explain St. Cyr if reliance isn't necessary?   St. Cyr is all about reliance. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Yes.   And at the end of this Court's opinion the Court said that the presence of this reliance made the retroactive effect especially obvious and sincere -- especially obvious and severe in St. Cyr.   That did not purport to overrule holdings in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft where there had been no legally cognizable reliance.   So St. Cyr is an easy case because of the guilty plea because of the reliance.   But Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft didn't involve any reliance and there was still retroactivity because the settled expectations were disrupted because there were new consequences attached to pre-enacted conduct.   So regardless of whether there is reliance, there are settled expectations that are upset by a law whose function or point is to punish and deter misconduct based on past wrongs.   My client-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " We are trying to figure out what Congress intended, right.   We're not talking about constitutionality.   We are talking about a rule that it's presumed that statutes are only prospective, right?   And your argument is the reasonable expectation of Congress when they passed this was that it would only apply to two people who, what, committed the crime or were convicted after the statute passed?   Just as a matter of statutory interpretation? "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " That is the background default rule against which Congress legislates.   And in laws such as IIRIRA and SORNA and elsewhere, Congress spells out what it wants to apply to pre-enactment offenses to pre-enactment conduct.   That's the defeasible civil retroactivity rule that can reach more broadly than the ex post facto jurisprudence-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, do you have any case in which a court has deemed its statute retroactive even though it wasn't triggered until the party took some further action?   Is there any case out there either from this Court or from another court where we've said it's retroactive even though it depends upon a future event. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor.   St. Cyr depended on applying for discretionary relief in the future.   He didn't have to.   Cummings depending on trying to teach or preach or hold office.   Ex parte Garland depended on trying to practice law in the future.   Those are all disabilities taking away a future ability based on a past wrong.   That's what the disability category has to mean if it's to remain meaningful.   And the government's approach would gut Justice Story's fourth category.   If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --Thank you, Counsel.   Mr. Miller. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   As the discussion so far this morning reveals, the Court's retroactivity analysis takes account of a number of different factors, but the one that is most significant and indeed in this case virtually dispositive is that the application of Section 1101(a)(13) to Petitioner was triggered only because he engaged in voluntary conduct that postdated the enactment of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What do you think the trigger to be?   Because in your brief you kept on talking about the trigger being the trip.   And I would have thought that you would have talked more about the activity being the attempt to enter the country. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " That's -- I mean they are closely connected together in time and they both -- but they both postdate the enactment of the statute.   But -- well, the thing that is being regulated by section 1101(a)(13) is the entry of aliens into the United States.   The statute sets out a comprehensive scheme for determining when an alien arriving at the border seeking to come into the United States should be regarded as seeking an admission.   So that's conduct that takes place in the future.   Part A of 1101(a)(13) sets out the general definition of admission and then (c) sets out a number of exceptions.   And so taken together they are part of a comprehensive effort to codify Fleuti in some respects and in particular Romanette (ii), the 180-day provision is actually a fairly generous codification of Fleuti probably extending beyond what would have been regarded as a brief trip under Fleuti. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, I have to -- I just don't understand this statute.   This is somebody we would not allow into the country.

Miller", "text": " And the second, I think to understand it, it's helpful to look at the history.   The distinction between grounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportability goes back all the way back to the 1917 Act.

And what the Court says there is that a person who is thinking of pleading guilty might well have taken into account the fact that he could ask the Attorney General later when he's about to be deported to exercise discretion in his favor.   So that's -- as I read those pages, you can say, I'm not reading them correctly, but that's how I read them.   And then, having read them that way, I thought the question in this case is whether the person who is sitting at the table and deciding whether to plead guilty or not is likely to think, well, if I plead guilty, I can always ask for discretion.   That's St. Cyr.   Well, if I plead guilty, I can still visit my aging parents and grandparents, a matter that could be of importance to some people, as opposed to whether I will never see them again.   Now, that seems to be the question.   Is the second as likely to be in the person's mind as the first?   And to tell you the truth, I don't know the answer.   I mean, maybe it would be.   There isn't that much chance of getting discretion.   It might be important to some people to visit their aging parents and grandparents.   So, go ahead.   Answer the question.

Miller", "text": " I think you have correctly described the reasoning of the Court in St. Cyr, and I think that that reasoning highlights two ways in which this case is significantly different.

And the Court said that there is a clear difference for purposes of the retroactivity analysis between the possibility of deportability and a certainty of deportation.

So Congress certainly wasn't clear on what policy they're following.   I would have thought that.   You can disagree with that.   But I -- but the part that's still gnawing at me: 95 percent of the people plead guilty.   All right.   You know.   Everybody pleads guilty.   Or about.   And now the -- the consequence that this ex post enacts is he can't take the 4-day trip.   And you keep saying well, a 4-day trip requires action on a person's part.   Right.   Of course it does.   So why does that matter?   I mean, the fact is he can't take the 4-day trip.   A 4-day trip requires action.   You have to buy a trip -- ticket.   You have to get on a plane.

The Petitioner isn't challenging that.   And the board in the Collado-Munoz decision has explained why the -- the statute in fact does have that effect.   And I -- I think the significance of this post-enactment conduct, the significance of the trip, is illustrated there by this Court's decision in Fernandez-Vargas, which -- which made clear that when you have -- when the application of the statute is within the control of the person to whom it's being applied, because he has to do something after it comes into effect -- there, it was choosing to remain in the United States and becoming subject to the reinstatement of a prior order of removal -- here, it's taking the travel.

And it's true that that conduct was unlawful, but for purposes of the retroactivity analysis, the Court didn't focus on whether it was lawful or unlawful.   What matters is that it was conduct that was in the future, that that was after the statute was enacted.   And so here, although the -- the trip is not unlawful in that sense, it is future conduct, and here as in Fernandez-Vargas, there is ample warning -- which was another point the Court emphasized in that case -- ample warning that the statute would be applied to people who engaged in that conduct.

And that looks at a number of factors.   And the most important factor under that test, the Court has said, is whether the statute appears to be related to a legitimate prospective regulatory purpose.   And so that's why, for example, statutes like 922(g), the felon in possession statute, which was, I would point out, amended back in 1996 to add misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence which had not previously been something that would subject one to a firearms disability.   That was added.   Every court of appeals that has considered the question has held that it doesn't violate the ex post facto clause, and I think implicitly has held that it does in fact reach that conduct.

The sex offender registration laws are another example of -- this Court has upheld that kind of law obviously imposes a very significant burden of people on the basis of prior conduct, but the fact that there is some burden by itself does not mean that the statute is retroactive.   Nor does it mean that it is appropriately viewed as imposing a disability.   I mean I think that the Court in Landgraf quoted Justice Story's formulation of a disability as referring to statutes that impose a disability in respect to transactions that are already passed.   So it is not enough that there used to be something that you could do and now in the future you are not going to be able to do that.

Miller", "text": " --I -- I-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Miller", "text": " --Well, I -- I think -- we don't question that that's something that people might have -- have been aware of, and have been thinking about, but it not something that was bargained for in the plea agreement, because it's not something that is affected by the plea agreement.   The statute here is triggered by the post-enactment conduct of entering the country, but also by the -- the pre-enactment conduct of committing the crime.   And as Petitioner has acknowledged, there isn't any reliance in the state of immigration law when you choose to commit the crime.   So I think that's -- that's a difference from the scenario that was addressed in Judulang. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Miller.   Mr. Bibas, you have 6 minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Stephanos Bibas", "text": " Thank you, Your Honor.   I would like to make five points.   The first one is the statute is poorly tailored to any protective or forward-looking effect.   As the Court has noted, its perverse effect is to discourage people from leaving the country, to keep them in.   So any idea that the purpose is to get them out doesn't square with the way the statute is written.   As Justice Ginsburg noted, while the post-IIRIRA innocent travel may be the trigger here, the obvious target is the pre-IIRIRA offense.   The statute is tied to misconduct.   The natural inference of making this conduct not just a piece of evidence but a prerequisite is that it is the misconduct that is being penalized.   Second, the impact we suggest is the relevant test.   The impact is a penalty.   It is a disability based on a past act that Mr. Vartelas is now helpless to undo.   That is all that is required under Landgraf.   If Congress thinks it important, it can expressly require retroactivity.   But it hasn't done so.   Third, let me make clear that we have alternative theories here.   Reliance is something that makes the case worse.   It is something that exacerbates the problem, makes it obvious and severe.   And our amici, the NACDL brief, points out very movingly how important these kinds of considerations are in immigrants' decisions to plead guilty.   Here for example, my client received a 4-month discount off his sentencing range.   It's entirely plausible to believe that immigrants in his situation might value the ability to stay in the same country with their 4-year-old and 2-year-old child as much as 4 months in jail.   But our broader theory is that the violation of settled expectations is sufficient whether or not there is reliance.   The settled expectations that one has of planning one's life in this country and yet having relatives abroad one will tend to or care for their business, etcetera, that is sufficient.   Just as in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft Company there were no legally cognizable reliance interests in discriminating or in submitting false claims, but changing the penalty is enough.   Fourth, this Court's decision in St. Cyr I believe strongly helps our case.   The first reason is that it imposed a disability, a disability on filing in the future for discretionary relief, but as a practical matter it is burdening past conduct.   Secondly, St. Cyr didn't purport to change the holdings in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft Company that those are other ways of showing impermissible retroactivity.   The logic in St. Cyr is ineluctable that because you are burdening a decision, a decision that, as the Court and the amici in St. Cyr noted, matters greatly and factors into the plea bargaining calculus, that the retroactivity is especially obvious and severe.   And let me note that St. Cyr was decided under this same statute, a privilege, not a right, a privilege that Congress can abrogate at any time.   That did not influence this Court's holding at all.   The right-privilege distinction is dead in this area of law.   If there is a privilege under IIRIRA to apply for discretionary relief, there is a privilege to not be subject to the disability on one's traveling and returning.   Finally, let me talk about the criminal-civil line.   My my brother here introduced Smith v. Doe and mentioned some of the sex offender cases.   I've explained why the criminal cases in ex post facto are different, but let me go into some more detail.   The Court is well familiar with Smith v. Doe.   That was a civil case that Doe attempted to turn into a criminal case under the very demanding standard in Kennedy v. Mendoza.   But that's a very uphill fight.   As the Court's opinion recognized, the court must be very deferential before turning something facially civil into criminal because then it's categorically forbidden and it comes with the criminal procedure protections in the Bill of Rights.   That's not what we are doing now.   We are not trying to say this law is forbidden.   Smith v. Doe involved a law where the court's opinion said on its face: The legislature made it retroactive; it says it's retroactive.   Federal law SORNA is expressly retroactive in section 113(d).   IIRIRA is expressly retroactive.   That's a different inquiry, where you're asking does the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids something that is expressly retroactive, does Mendoza-Martinez turn it into a criminal case?   Versus here, where it's not retroactive.   All Congress has to do is spell it out.   If this Court adheres to its previous jurisprudence, the guidance to the drafters across the street is clear: Just draft the statutes the way you have always been doing it, say before, on, or after effective date.

SORNA in 2005 likewise in Section 113(d) says: Yes, this sex offender registration shall apply, the Attorney General can apply it to people with pre-SORNA convictions.
