[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-422, Rucho versus Common Cause. Mr. Clement. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly failed to identify a justiciable standard for partisan gerrymandering claims.   The cause of that failure is not a lack of judicial imagination or a lack of claims that the particular map before the Court was the most extreme ever. Rather, the root cause of this failure is the basic decision of the framers to give responsibility for congressional districting to political actors.   The framers consciously chose to gave the prime -- give the primary authority to state legislatures.   And then, to police the possibility that state legislatures, which the framers knew to be partisan institutions, would engage in too much partisanship, the framers chose a structural solution, by giving -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- the federal Congress supervisory authority. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Clement, that ship has sailed in Baker v. Carr.   Once we decided the one-person, one-vote concept, we've been pretty much in all of our jurisprudence saying that certain acts by the legislature are unconstitutional, including race discrimination and others. It can't be that simply because the Constitution says that a particular act is in the hands of one -- one branch of government, that that deprives the courts of reviewing whether that action is constitutional or not. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, Justice Sotomayor, I suppose the question of whether that ship sailed in Baker v. Carr is one way of presenting the question before the Court today. And I would submit that you don't have a one-size-fits-all solution for justiciability, and I don't think Baker v. Carr supports that proposition. Indeed, I took the central lesson of Baker v. Carr to be that the same claim, essentially, when presented as an equal protection claim, was justiciable when the same claim presented as a Republican Guarantee Clause claim was not justiciable. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But, Mister -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And I took -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- Mr. Clement, does one person have one vote that counts equally, which I take it to be the -- the message of those cases, now well accepted, does one person have one vote that counts equally with others if the impact of her vote is reduced based on her party affiliation? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " The answer to that question, Justice Ginsburg, is yes.   You still have an equal right to vote as an individual. And what the parties on the other side are really complaining of here is not a purely individual injury.   What they're complaining of is that they're grouped in a district with either too many people who agree with them or too few people who agree with them, and, therefore, their vote is sort of diluted in some way. And I don't think that is, in the first place, an individual legally cognizable interest, so I think they have a standing problem.   But even if they get over the standing problem, then I don't think that's a justiciable injury. And I would say more broadly, you know, lots and lots of voters live in a district where, either because of geography or because of state action, they're not going to have their preferred candidate elected. Indeed, I'd go further and say most Americans don't get their preferred candidate elected because they have to choose from the candidates that are before them, and maybe based on the district they live in, it tends to give them a relatively liberal Democrat or a relatively conservative Republican when really what they'd prefer is somebody down the middle. And none of those things, I think, are things that you are constitutionally entitled to. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Clement, would your position require us to overrule Davis versus Bandemer? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, it would decide -- it would depend on which way you decided the case.   I don't -- I think if you decided the case -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, if we decided it in your favor, would it require us to overrule? (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And it would still depend, Your Honor, on whether you decide it in our favor on standing grounds or on justiciability grounds. If you decided it in our favor on justiciability grounds, I think you would have to overrule the Bandemer case.   I think the Bandemer case is a case that well deserves overruling, and I'm happy to discuss why that is the case. I certainly think, as Justice Scalia pointed out for four justices in Vieth, it is a case that uniquely has no reliance interests on it, other than the potential reliance interests of litigants, but it hasn't produced actual results, and I think, as -- as Justice Scalia said, it's a decision that sort of triply doesn't have a strong claim to stare decisis. But I also think, if you decided the case on standing grounds, you would really be deciding the grounds -- the case on grounds that are actually interior to anything the Court decided definitively in Bandemer. So I really think it does depend on how you decide the case in our favor as to whether you need to overrule Bandemer. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Clement, if I understand the bottom line of your argument, you would answer the question that one of my -- I don't want to call him a former colleague, he's still a colleague but no longer on the -- on the bench with us, Justice Kennedy asked in one of these cases, and it was if a state constitution had a provision that required redistricting to be based solely on partisan grounds -- forget about whether they -- they were meeting any other traditional grounds or not -- you would say that was constitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, actually, Justice Sotomayor, I -- I think I might say to the particular hypo -- and I think it matters how you frame it, I mean, I do think that if you took a state constitutional provision and tried to have it impose some requirement that's going to apply to every redistricting going forward, there's at least an argument that there's actually an Election Clause problem with that effort to try to control sort of subsequent redistricting efforts. Now you may or may not accept that argument, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You're saying -- you're basically saying yes, that would mean, as occurred here, that almost 50 percent of one party's vote is going to result in maybe less than one-third of their representation in Congress?

And I think you've put your finger on what my friends on the other side perceive to be the problem, which is a lack of proportional representation. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, that -- that -- no, because all of the tests that they're proposing and that the district court looked at didn't talk about proportionate representation. It looked at only the opportunity to elect. An opportunity is different.   The way this is structured, there is absolutely no opportunity to -- not none but virtually none -- I'm exaggerating slightly -- but -- but virtually none for maybe a majority party to elect more than or less than a third of the people they voted for. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I think that that difference -- first of all, I think that difference is implicit in the idea of having districts rather than statewide elections for the Congress. And keep in mind that the Constitution as originally enacted, there's now a statute that changes this, but as -- for constitutional purposes, it is perfectly constitutional for a state to embrace the policy idea that proportional representation is a good thing and implement it by saying we're going to elect Congress not by districts but by statewide votes.   That was a perfectly -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, Mister -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Clement, can I -- can I take -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- Mr. Clement -- no, please.

I wasn't quite sure I understood your answer, and I'll say the question in a little bit of a different way. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Because it -- it -- it seems to me that this is kind of Justice Kennedy's hypothetical come to life in -- in this sense, that there is a particular provision in the legislation here that says the partisan makeup of the congressional delegation is 10 Republicans and three Democrats, and the committee shall make reasonable efforts to construct districts to maintain that current partisan makeup, 10 and three. So it was specifically written into the law that whatever else you do, and there were definitely other things that the lawmakers wanted done, but whatever else you do, go come back with the same 10 and three.   And I think that that was the import of Justice Kennedy's question, is like can you write that into a law and say that's what we're trying to do here? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Kagan, two responses.   One is I -- I -- I -- I did notice every time Justice Kennedy asked that question, he did ask it the way that Justice Sotomayor did and built in this notion that you were going to permanently enshrine that preference for future elections. So I do just want to drop the footnote that I think there may be something distinctly problem -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " This seems pretty enshrined.   Go do it -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- 10 and three. That's the current.   That's what we want to maintain. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " But, no, I think there's a difference, and -- but I'm happy to respond to your -- your question about can you have it as an express criterion for a particular districting. And I think the answer -- sort of obviously given who I'm representing -- is absolutely yes, that's not a problem, and, by the way, I think actually being candid about it probably serves accountability principles in the long run, which is to say if you think -- which I think almost everybody does -- that implicitly that's what the Republican legislature was doing in Bandemer, in fact, they were explicit in their deposition testimony, if you look at Footnote 5 of Justice White's opinion, that the people who drew that map, the speaker of the Republican House of Indiana was express that his goal was to preserve as many Republican incumbents as possible.

Are -- do the legislatures of the state typically control what is in the state constitution? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " They -- they don't, Justice Alito, and that's why I do think it is important to figure out -- I mean, I think Justice Kennedy may have framed that question in a particular way. I mean, I -- I don't want to go too far down the road of relitigating the Arizona independent redistricting case here, but, you know, I do think there is a certainly respectable argument that state legislature means state legislature and not the other parts of the state government.   And that's why I do think there are separate issues. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It can mean the people -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " It -- it -- it -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- when it's done by referendum. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- it well could, Justice Ginsburg.   And, indeed, there are -- there are at least four people that agreed with you on that proposition.   And I -- and I don't want to relitigate that here because I don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D.

Clement", "text": " -- and you can still say that the claims here are not justiciable. And to be as responsive as I can to Justice Kagan's question, I don't think there is a constitutional problem when a state legislature makes explicit with respect to the redistricting they're undertaking at that moment if they make explicit what was ultimately explicit after the record was built up in Bandemer and Vieth, which is it just didn't happen that they got a map that was favorable to Republicans, that they actually intended to do that, along with traditional redistricting principles. And I think, Justice Kagan, the way you read the criteria is exactly right.   With respect to partisan advantage, as they called it, they said reasonable efforts will be made. With respect to other items on their list of criteria, like -- like contiguity, they said shall.   So some things were non-negotiable, like contiguousness and equal population.   Other things were negotiable, but reasonable efforts would be made. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Clement, along those lines, in terms of Democratic accountability on this, one of the arguments that we've heard is that the Court must act because nobody else can as a practical matter. But -- but given Arizona, and that is the holding of the Court, is that true? And to what extent have states, through their initiatives, citizen initiatives, or at the ballot box in elections through their legislatures, amended their constitutions or otherwise provided for remedies in this area? I -- I -- I just happen to know my home state of Colorado this last November had such a referendum on the ballot that passed overwhelmingly, as I recall.   So I -- I believe there are others and I'm just wondering, what's the scope of the problem here? I also know there are five states with only a single representative, right, so -- in Congress, so presumably this isn't a problem there. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " That's right.   And to the extent it's a problem at all, the scope of the issue, shall we say, is, you know, roughly 30 states that don't have some kind of mechanism like you've described or have multiple districts and, you know, I think even when you get to -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But how many -- my sense is there's a lot of movement in this area.   I -- I believe there were four or five states along with Colorado just this last election that acted. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " That's exactly right. Michigan is another state that passed a ballot initiative.   And, of course, the other sort of place where there can be a solution to this, which is the most obvious one and is a solution no matter what you think of the Arizona independent case, is Congress. And if you look at HR-1, the very first bill that the new Congress put on their agenda, it was an effort to essentially force states to have bipartisan commissions, now query whether that's constitutional, but it certainly shows that Congress is able to take action in this particular area. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I suppose the -- I suppose the members of Congress are pretty happy with the way the districting has been done. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, you -- you might think, Mr. Chief Justice, but, actually, I don't think the majority of them are, because that was a bill that I think passed on party line votes. And so, I mean, to the extent that -- that people, other justices of this Court in the past have been concerned about things like entrenchment and the like, I mean, it's a little odd here that we've had all of this supposedly partisan redistricting to benefit the composition of Congress, and yet a majority of Congress thinks that they should pass HR-1. So I just don't know that there really is that much of a problem.   And I do think it's -- you know, the particular context that arises here is the context of congressional redistricting, and one of the elements of the framers' structural solution was they didn't directly tell Congress: Why don't you district for yourself. They said in the first instance let's have somebody else at the state level closer to the people do the districting and then we'll give Congress a role to supervise that. So they didn't have sort of the same fox guarding the same hen house in this particular context. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Imagine I -- you may not want to answer this question, which I'd understand.   You might not have thought about it. But assume that absolutely this is illegal, all right, or unconstitutional, but there's no remedy.   We can't figure out a remedy.   All right? That's where I want you to start. Now I -- I tried one in Vieth, you know, and -- and the -- and my guess is from the reaction there was none and so probably there's something wrong with it. But what I'm trying to do is to figure out if there's a way to catch real outliers, just you can't go beyond that, I mean, at the moment I'm assuming, the real outliers. So which are the real outliers? Now, if we look at history, there wasn't that much gerrymandering in the past compared to what there might be with computers in the future. Okay? So I've tried to figure out something simple, not going to get all -- every judge in the country mixed up, not going to lead to every election contested and throw it all to the judges instead of the people.   Okay? Anybody can figure it out. Now this is what it is, that if a gerrymander, dah-dah-dah, is un -- if -- if there's a -- a commission or something, forget it, you're out of court right away.   Okay? But, if there is no commission, one party controls it, then a gerrymander is unconstitutional if a party that wins a majority of the votes in a state, so they won a majority of the votes, but the other party gets more than two-thirds of the seats.   You see? That would be pretty extreme.   But your client might meet it.   And the virtue of it, it's absolutely simple.   By the way, they can try to justify it and then we can use, you know, the -- Landers -- you know, something like those five percent things to test the justifications, but there won't be much can be justified.   Now it could be a starting place. And that two-thirds number is not drawn out of thin air.   The Constitution, in fact, you can find serious matters, overriding vetoes, constitutional amendments, and you can show how gerrymandering wrecks what they assumed for those, but that's a different story, you can find. And it -- it very rarely would operate, but it would be somewhere.   Now have you thought about anything like that? Do you have any reaction? Your reaction would be, no, that's no good, but I mean aside from -- aside from that, have -- is there anything you want to contribute to thought on that? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, Justice Breyer, in -- in all candor, there's so much in that that I disagree with that it's a little hard to know where to start. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right, all right. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I'm going to resist at first the temptation to take issue with the premises, though if I have time I'll get back to that.   Let me take issue with the two basic prongs of your test. So, first, the reason I think your test has to be a non-starter is the fact that, as you say, your test would basically give a pass to any state that doesn't use the method prescribed by the framers to engage in congressional districting. So it would be a strike against the state if they actually did what the framers envisioned -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- which is have a legislature -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- wait one second there.   I'm just saying this is perhaps a start.   I'm not saying anybody gets a pass. But I'm saying you wouldn't have to go further than that in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I thought I heard you say that if you were a state that used a bipartisan commission, dot, dot, dot -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Oh, yes, that's right.   That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- you would get a pass. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah, yeah, you're right. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " And that seems to me itself to be remarkably revealing because you're basically saying that it would be a good thing for the state if they chose to use a mechanism other than the one that the framers picked. So that's my big objection to the intent prong. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Not if you -- not if you say that for this purpose, the legislature is the people.   And that's what Arizona held --- held. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, Justice Ginsburg, in fairness, I think what Arizona held is that the people are within that concept, but I certainly don't think Arizona stands for the proposition that what the framers had in mind primarily was something other than the state legislatures. So it seems to me it's a strike against your test that it identifies as a problem something that the framers would have associated with the primary mechanism they used for redistricting.   So on the effects -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If I -- if I can just interrupt for one second. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, going down that road would suggest that Justice Gorsuch's attempt to sort of say this is not so bad because the people can fix it is not so true because you're suggesting that the people really maybe can't fix it, you were wrong about the people being able to fix it, and if the people could fix it, while it's not the constitutionally prescribed way because it's never been done before, so Justice Gorsuch's attempts to save what's so dramatically wrong here, which is the Court leaving this all to professional politicians who have an interest in districting according to their own partisan interests, seems to fail. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I -- I would disagree, Justice Kagan.   I mean, I took the import of Justice Gorsuch's question being that, you know, maybe we can allow the states to solve this problem for themselves. But I think then, when you get at the starting point of Justice Breyer's question, which is at a certain point -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- the federal government, through its justices and judges, are going to intervene and put limits on what the state does. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right, I've got this point, but what I'm trying to get you to focus on -- because I've read the briefs, you know, I -- this is the fourth time, and I -- and I -- I think I -- but the thing that I want you to focus on, if you can, if you want to, is the two-thirds majority idea. Look, my party got a majority of the votes in the state, but we ended up with less than a third of the seats.   You see, I said -- my tone of voice is meant to be, gee, this is really extraordinary, but there is absolutely a workable standard. Now the next question is all the constitutional arguments you're raising.   I'm not pushing those under the rug, but, for present purposes, I want you to see if there's any reaction to the practicality of this standard. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I -- I think the way I would respond to that, Justice Breyer, is I am not here to tell you that if the Constitution included a one standard deviation from proportional representation clause or a one-third/two-thirds clause, that judges somehow would be incapable of administering that clause. So I think the fundamental problem is there is no one standard deviation from proportional representation clause in the Constitution.   And, indeed, you can't talk even generally about outliers or extremity unless you know what it is you're deviating from. And I take it, implicit in your question and implicit in Justice Sotomayor's question, that what's bothering people is a deviation from a principle of proportional representation. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Actually -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- you keep saying that, but I -- I -- I don't quite think that that's right given the statistical analysis in this case. I mean, you're quite right that this Court in the past has said this country does not run on proportional representation and this is a hang-up in our ability to solve this problem.   But what's -- what's -- what's quite interesting about the statistical analysis in this case is that quite a lot of it does not run off a proportional representation benchmark. In other words, all the computer simulations, all the 25,000 maps, right, really do take the political geography of the state as a given.   So -- so, if Democrats are clustered and Republicans aren't, that's in the program. And all the other redistricting requirements or preferences, like contiguity, like following natural boundaries, that's all in the program. So there's -- the benchmark is not proportional representation.   The benchmark is the natural political geography of the state, plus all the districting criteria, except for partisanship. And if you run those maps, right, what did you get? You got 24,000 maps and this -- and 99 percent of them, 99 plus percent of them, were on one side of the map that was picked here.   All of those maps show that a 10/three configuration is not the natural one. And it's not the natural one not because it's not proportional representation.   It's just not the way anybody can district, given the actual political geography on the ground, unless you absolutely try to overrule that political geography. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Kagan, two points.   One is, I mean, I'm happy to respond to the maps, but I do think Justice Breyer, in fairness, did build in a notion of proportional represent -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, I don't think it does -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, okay.   Then I'm -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- for this reason. The reason is all it says is a part -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, yeah, I -- I -- wait.   Justice Breyer -- I want you to come back to Justice Breyer's question, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Okay.   I -- I just -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- I want you to ask mine -- answer mine. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- I hear one-third/ two-third, and I -- I sure thought we were talking about proportional representation. As to the maps, you know what I found striking about the maps -- and I think this is different from what you found striking about the maps -- but, first of all, you can do this 24,000 different ways.   So that seems like this is about as discretionary a government function as one could imagine. And if you go all the way back to Marbury versus Madison and what makes something a political question, it is a purely discretionary function.   You can do this 24,000 different ways. The second thing I found -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, that's making lemonade out of lemons. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, let me -- let me try to make -- can I make -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- can -- can I make one point more? "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You can do it 24,000 different ways and 23,999 produce an outcome that's less partisan than the one the legislature picked here. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " But, see, what I think is remarkable is actually that what the statistics show -- and this is on page 162 of the -- of the -- of the JSA -- is that if you run 24,000 maps with partisanship taken out entirely and you just use traditional juris- -- traditional principles, you get 162 different maps that produce a 10/three Republican split. So, yeah, it's one percent, it's .7 percent -- I mean .7 percent, just to be clear.   That's 162 different ways to get to a 10/three map that didn't take politics into account at all. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But, if you have 24,000 maps that satisfy all of the so-called neutral criteria that you put in your computer program, don't you need a criterion or criteria for deciding which of the 24,000 maps you're going to choose? And implicit in Justice Kagan's comments is the idea, is it not, that you have to choose one that honors proportional representation? You have no other criteria for distinguishing among the 24,000 maps. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I think that's right.   And at a bare minimum, it has to be that those 162 -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Why, Mr. Clement? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- because they're over here, are off limits. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, finish your answer. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Clement, let's go back to the why of that.   You keep talking about proportional representation, but it's not, because what was shown is that 99 percent of the time you get a map that is more fair to both parties than the one that was chosen. And so the issue is you can -- you can have 162, 164, but what you can't do in picking that one percent of a map is discriminate against a group of people based on their political views.   We have a legion of cases that say you can't treat political parties differently because it's an equal protection violation.   And it's the same thing, whether it's because of their speech or their activities. What we're telling you is pick any other map you want; just don't split counties, as was done here, sole -- based solely on your political views, because counties were split. Don't pick or don't -- you may use saving an incumbent, but don't kick one out because by kicking one out -- and there is a map that would keep all of the incumbents in place -- don't kick one out because you're excluding people based on their political views. This is what this is about.   You're discriminating on the basis of a group's speech and diluting their vote accordingly. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D.

Nobody thinks it's unfair, I don't think, that Republicans in Massachusetts under the current maps are never going to be able to elect somebody to Congress even though they're something like 35 percent of the population, nobody thinks that's unfair, because you really can't draw districts to do it because they're evenly distributed.

First, partisan intent has to be proven on a district-specific basis, that is, proving that district lines were drawn to subordinate the adherence of one political party and entrench the power of the party drawing the lines. Second, partisan effect has to be shown at the district-specific and plan-wide levels.   The district-specific effect inquiry looks at intentional cracking, the cracking and packing of Democratic clusters or Republican clusters, as it will, and the state-wide, the plan-wide inquiry is whether the map as a whole creates a severe and durable effect on the disfavored party.

It's breathing room to employ some political consideration.   It's breathing room -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, why -- why isn't the answer to Justice Gorsuch's question that what's not allowed is deviation from whatever the state would have come up with, absent these partisan considerations? In other words, the state can do whatever it wants, it can depart from proportional representation however much it wants to, however much the natural features of the state would suggest, it can come up with something that's not proportional representation at all. What it can't do is deviate from that based on partisan considerations.   Isn't that what this test is essentially driving at? "}, {"speaker": "Allison J. Riggs", "text": " It -- that gets at the effects prong.   I think that's a grading calculation. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yes, that's what I was talking about.

But I guess my question is, once we control for geography, once we control for all those things, we're going to have hundreds and hundreds of maps, as Justice Alito has pointed out.   Computers spit them out infinitely now. And once we say, okay, all these other factors are controlled for, we can -- we can do a regression analysis, control for geography and all these things, we're still going to have hundreds of maps.   And the legislature is going to choose one. And at that point, we have to say, what's the range of permissible options? And that -- from that, we need a baseline.   And the baseline, I still think, if it's not proportional representation, what is the baseline that you would have us use? "}, {"speaker": "Allison J.

So, after that, when we're left with -- we've thrown out millions of -- of maps; we're only left with a mere few thousand, okay? What -- what deviation? From what to what? "}, {"speaker": "Allison J. Riggs", "text": " If -- if what we're left with is no extreme statistical outlier or no grossly asymmetrical map, the legislature can choose from any of those plans. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, what is -- what is wrong with proportional representation? "}, {"speaker": "Allison J.

We -- we live in a system with single-member plan -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " If you -- if you were cracking or packing to get to proportional representation, would that in your view be unconstitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Allison J. Riggs", "text": " This Court has endorsed that kind of activity in Gaffney, where a legislature is striving for proportional representation.   Our test would not invalidate a plan like Gaffney because it would not have a statewide severe and durable effect and it would be something that you would see within the simulations.

Kavanaugh", "text": " Do you agree with Mr. Clement that the Constitution does not require proportional representation or require something close to proportional representation? "}, {"speaker": "Allison J. Riggs", "text": " The Constitution does not require it.   But what we see here in this test that we've employed, Justice Roberts, to get to one of your earlier questions, is a test that employs a durability inquiry and sensitivity -- sensitivity testing, technology that was not in existence in Vieth and Bandemer and the Republican judges case in the 1990s, and that map drawers are using right now. If there is a plan where, under any plausible shift of voter sentiment, the bias across the plan would disappear, that plan would not be unconstitutional.   Again, this is a -- an enormous screen to the kinds of plans that would be subject to liability. Our proposed test, the one adopted by the district court, is so exacting that it narrows dramatically the number of plans subject to -- to scrutiny and leaves legislatures lots of breathing room.   And -- and -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Am I right to understand that your -- your test allows a greater degree of partisanship in redistricting than Mr. Bondurant's?

Riggs", "text": " I think they're -- they're complementary tests depending on how you understand the constitutional harm, where we see vote -- the vote dilution tests based on the one-person, one-vote and the racial vote dilution frameworks, we see those tests as allowing room for some political considerations, particularly the ones endorsed by this Court.   But it -- it's just a different approach to the same problem. We do believe that our test does give -- is narrow and descriptive enough that it gives legislatures guidance on what to do to make sure that they stay on the right side of the Constitution, and limits -- gives -- gives lower courts something very manageable to -- to apply and to grapple with, and that the pleading standards are going to be very high. To prove a severe and durable effect is not to just allege it.   It's to come forward with rigorous statistical evidence that supports this situation. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " I took -- I took some of your argument in the briefs and the amicus briefs to be that extreme partisan gerrymandering is a real problem for our democracy -- and I'm not going to dispute that -- and that the Court, even though it might be a problem to get involved in all these cases, should, in essence, recognize the emergency situation from your perspective. But what about, to pick up on something Justice Gorsuch said earlier, that there is a fair amount of activity going on in the states on redistricting and attention in Congress and in state supreme courts? In other words, have we reached the moment, even though it would be a -- have we really reached the moment, even though it would be a big lift for this Court to get involved, where the other actors can't do it?

And the idea, I think in the briefs, is this Court and this Court alone can step in.   And -- and there is a fair amount of activity going on in the states, recognizing the same problem that you're recognizing. "}, {"speaker": "Allison J.

Riggs", "text": " Other options don't relieve this Court of its duty to vindicate constitutional rights.   And, certainly, while the -- the reputation of the Court as an independent check is an important consideration, understand that on the facts of this case, the reputational risk to the Court of doing nothing when -- when David Lewis says, I'm going to draw a 10/three plan and if I could drew an 11/two plan, I would, the reputational risk of doing something is much, much less than the reputational risk of doing nothing, which will be read as a green light for this kind of discriminatory rhetoric and manipulation in redistricting from here on out. This is -- this is a situation where, with all due respect, Justice O'Connor was not correct.   This isn't self-correcting.   Voters in North Carolina, no matter how hard -- no matter what level they turn out -- this was a swing election in 2018 for North Carolina voters, and they were not able to eliminate the bias in the plans. This -- the techniques are so sophisticated now that there's no room for self-correction.   And these voters -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Clement", "text": " Thank you, Your Honors. Just a few points in two minutes. First, I do think at a very fundamental level my friends on the other side are the victim of their own technology because they have produced 24,000 maps that are permissible maps that don't take partisanship into account at all. And their submission is that a legislature organized on partisanship lines cannot take partisanship into account to any material degree in picking among the 24,000 maps. And that's just an argument ultimately to reassign this authority away from state legislatures and to somebody else who doesn't have a partisanship interest -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- or a partisanship organization. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- that -- that's just not true because what they have shown is, if you don't use partisanship as the predominant factor, then you can produce a lot of maps that are not this one.   That's what they have shown. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Right.

So you're basically asking state legislatures not to act as state legislatures. And let me just finish with this observation, which is a lot of hard constitutional issues come before this Court because you're dealing with something that was unknown to the framing generation. But the framing generation understood partisan gerrymandering firsthand.   James Madison was the intended target of a partisan gerrymander by Patrick Henry.   He complained about it bitterly.   So did George Washington. Neither of them contemplated suit. Hamilton actually suggested to John Jay that the Federalists ought to partisanly gerrymander the electoral college for the 1800 Presidential election.   John Jay said it wasn't such a good idea. All three authors of the Federalist Papers knew about this and didn't think there was a judicial solution. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.
