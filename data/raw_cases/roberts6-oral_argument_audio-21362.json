You can either demand that right, or you could demand your right to a speedy trial.   That was your choice.   And it seems to me what counsel chose was to insist all along, I want my right to two -- to two counsel.   You didn't have to-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Bourke, did anyone-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --you didn't have to take that right.   You could have gone to the supreme court and said, you know, Since it's taking so long, I demand my constitutional right to a speedy trial.   But you didn't do that.

But if you wait, we might have funding for another lawyer here who will join him, is more senior in experience, that will double your firepower.   You can choose, Mr. Boyer, do you want to go ahead now with this guy, or do you want to wait?   In that circumstance there would not be an invidious choice between the right to counsel and the right to speedy trial.   It would be, We are giving you constitutionally adequate counsel, and you can wait for better if you wish to.   But that is not what occurred here.   And, Justice Scalia, the-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Can you tell me why that is not what occurred here? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --Because the funding problem did not exist solely around Mr. Lorenzi's overhead and expenditure.   There was no money for investigation, there was no money for experts.   And the associate counsel who had been appointed had been appointed solely and for the limited purpose as an assistant to Mr. Lorenzi, not to conduct the case in his own right.   If this issue had been raised in the trial court, this would have been clearly explained into this record.   It wasn't.   But the trial court and the appellate court -- the court of appeal, Third Circuit in Louisiana, knew and understood that there was no investigative funding, there was no expert funding, there had been an assistant.   This isn't the case where there was a lawyer appointed and they were waiting for the second lawyer.   It's a case where they'd found an assistant and were waiting for the first lawyer. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " How much money would be needed for investigation and experts before you would acknowledge that that would be competent representation? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " That is a very case-specific determination, Your Honor, and in Louisiana at that time rested with a judicial determination that the investigative or expert expenses were reasonably necessary to ensure a fair trial within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.   So it was a funding level tagged to the constitutional minimum of due process. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Of course, a finding by the district court, or whichever court found it, that there was not enough money to pay counsel, to investigate, and to do whatever else -- buy stamps -- is not a finding by the district court that there was not enough money to investigate and to buy stamps.   Counsel was a part of that mix.   You never had a finding that there was not enough money to pay counsel, right?   Or -- I'm sorry, that there was not enough money to allow the counsel that has been appointed to investigate and buy stamps.   Was there ever any such finding? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " There was never-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " The -- the big tag item was paying counsel, wasn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --No, Your Honor, that was one of the big tag items.   But in a capital case, the investigation of both the guilt phase and the full mitigation and life investigation, along with the use of potential expert witnesses, particularly in the case where there were all the indications of mental health problems and the like, are often equal to or in some cases greater than the cost of counsel.   And so no, the big tag item wasn't just Mr. Lorenzi's overhead and expenses.   The big tag item was providing adequate funding.   And to return to your earlier point, Justice Scalia, just to -- to make it clear, the Louisiana Supreme Court cases which mandate that a case cannot go forward without counsel do not reference Rule 31 at all, or two counsel.   They are cases which stand for the proposition that the case cannot go forward without constitutionally adequate counsel, counsel who can provide reasonably effective assistance.   This case began in 2002.   At that point, the controlling Louisiana decision on not moving forward without effective assistance was Peart, P-e-a-r-t, which we cite in our brief, which said that the court will not allow a case to proceed without reasonably effective counsel.   During the life of this case -- sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Your point of view in this case-- "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Yes, sir. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --In your point of view, would it satisfy you if we say the Louisiana court of appeal found the largest part of the delay involved the funding crisis experienced by the State of Louisiana -- that meant giving you adequate money for counsel.   Then they said, the progression of the prosecution was out of the State's control as determined by this court, which I think referred to that funding crisis.   And we could -- and your view would be that's what they said.   We don't know the underlying facts, but that's what they said.   And insofar as they said that the State wasn't responsible for that part of the delay that they are talking about, they're wrong, because the State is responsible for not providing enough money, even if there's a problem and to say they weren't responsible is wrong, okay?   That's what you want us to say? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Period, and send it back. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Well, Your Honor-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You would like us to say what Judge Cook said in her opinion, that responsibility for funding rests with the State, not with the defendant.   Once an attorney is appointed, it is the State's obligation to ensure that adequate funds are available for the defense.   And I take \u201c for the defense \u201d to mean not simply counsel, but the witnesses, the investigation.   It is certainly true that none of the delay due to the lack of funds was in any way attributable to the defense.   That's essentially what you would like us to say? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --That is what Judge Cook said. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I don't think it's enough that none of the delay was attributable to the defense.   The defense has to complain, has to demand its right to a prompt trial.   What did your client do?   Frankly, I am skeptical that a capital defendant who has already confessed to the crime wants to be tried as soon as possible.   I'm skeptical about that.   Now, what -- what did your client do to demand his right to a prompt trial? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Your Honor, what Mr. Boyer did was act at all times in full compliance with the procedural mechanisms set up in Louisiana for doing that.   At arraignment -- he had already identified he was indigent and asked for counsel.   At arraignment, he requested a jury trial.   His lawyer was appointed, and his lawyer immediately identified the funding problem, and said: We need money or we can't go forward.   Louisiana statute bars counsel from filing a motion for speedy trial without an affidavit saying you're ready to go forward.   Louisiana has said in article 7-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, that's -- surely that's unconstitutional.   Did counsel say, I demand a speedy trial?   You can't condition my right to a speedy trial upon my getting some affidavit or something. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --It's a procedural rule, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I'm still waiting for anybody telling the court: I demand a speedy trial, and if I don't get a speedy trial, you are violating the Constitution and I ought to go scot-free. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Well, Your Honor, the rule I am referring to is a procedural rule.   It does not in any way limit the relief from a speedy trial, but you can't move for a speedy trial.   You can move to quash because you have been denied one, but you can't move for one.   It's exactly what this Court referred to in-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Isn't it true that you waited 3 years before doing that? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --That was the first point at which under Louisiana procedure he had a remedy available, exactly as Judge Cook stated in her abstaining opinion.   That was when he could move to quash.   He could not move for a speedy trial in a valid motion for speedy trial without having an affidavit saying, we are ready to go.   Louisiana has passed that rule to stop pro forma requests for speedy trial. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Can we clarify one point?   Justice Scalia said something about a defendant facing the death penalty going scot-free.   There was an armed robbery charge that was added in 2007.   Do you dispute that a new clock started in 2007, the first time that the robbery charge was made? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " We do, Your Honor.   That armed robbery charge is a lesser included offense of the first-degree murder count.   Mr. Boyer was originally indicted on first-degree murder, which in Louisiana is intentional killing during the course of an armed robbery.   There are other varieties, of course.   But intentional killing during an armed robbery.   And those are the elements of first-degree murder.   The State unpacked those two elements, or two lesser included offenses, to second-degree murder, which is intentional killing, and armed robbery.   And the State in fact conceded that had the charge remained a first-degree murder charge then the armed robbery charge would have created a double jeopardy problem, and that's at page 3703 to '4 of the record, where counsel for the State indicated that the armed robbery charge could be added because the primary charge, the first-degree murder, had been dropped to second-degree murder, and specifically said,   \"Mr. Bourke is correct that had we filed for first-degree murder, there may be double jeopardy problems. \"   But because they had unpacked that charge from murder and armed robbery down to murder and also armed robbery, there was no double jeopardy problem. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " What about -- what about the basic problem in this case as I understand the question presented, is, should the State be responsible when the funding problem is at a local level?   So suppose you have a State that says, you know, we have had problems in funding; if we give this to the county, it's going to be much better, and the counties are very, very good at raising money and knowing who the counsel are.   So it's all handled by the county.   Then one county has a disaster, a hurricane in that county particularly.   Is that not a reason for delaying, or does the State have to immediately step in and supplement the funding?   Can't the county say, oh, we need another 2 years? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Justice Kennedy-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I take it that's the issue that we're trying to decide here. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --Well, I think it starts with the proposition that it is the State, not the prosecutor who has the responsibility to ensure a speedy trial in accordance with due process.   And then the State can make all sorts of different arrangements and the States around this country make different arrangements, but it's their responsibility to make sure that they work.   And if they don't work, then the State is going to have to make reasonable accommodation for that to meet its responsibility.   And so by assisting the cause of delay against the State, but within the Barker weighing framework, the Court's dealing with speedy trial claims would be able to deal with short-term unexpected exigencies, they would be able to weigh the reasonableness of the response.   A valid reason for delay will justify that delay, as this Court said in Barker, but here-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " The answer to the question, that's what I was trying to do -- this case, the briefing is filled with whether he asked in time, whether he was delaying, whether he should have done some other thing, whether he should have -- but the question that's asked is simply whether the failure to fund counsel is a factor that should be weighed against the State. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And maybe it only gets very little weight, because maybe there was a hurricane, and maybe it doesn't even matter because he didn't make the right motions.   But the lower court said it shouldn't be weighed against the State, period.   And do we have to do anything other than say, If you're right, yes, it should.   Now, how much weight it gets, well, that depends.   There was a hurricane and -- but -- but it's something that they can't just ignore in -- in the hearing.   They have to figure out what happened and to the extent the State should have done more, it weighs against the State.   Do you want any more than that? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And what else-- "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " The first thing that we want is exactly that, Your Honor, that the court below incorrectly -- incorrectly failed to attribute this to the State.   And this Court -- I accept this Court could stop there and remand to the Third Circuit to deal with that in accordance with-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Not quite.   I mean, the question presented is not as general as that.   It's much more fact-bound.   It says whether a State's failure to fund counsel for an indigent for 5 years, particularly where failure was the direct result of the prosecution's choice to seek the death penalty should be weighed against the State for speedy trial purposes.   I think this is inviting us to look into the facts of this case and decide whether this 5-year delay, particularly since the prosecution chose the death penalty -- you know, I don't like having to do that and -- but it seems to me that's what the question presented at least requires. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, it -- I think it would be open to this Court to answer the question by saying the court got it wrong at the first step by failing to attribute it to the State and then remand for full consideration of weighing in light of that.   What we have asked in our briefing for the Court to do is to also provide some guidance on the weight that should be given to delay resulting from the lack of funding, because in this case-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If we provide -- if we provide that guidance, what do we do about the continuances that Mr. Lorenzi requested that relate to the funding?   January 10, 2003, Lorenzi requests a continuance of funding hearing citing scheduling problems.   August 5, 2003, Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion to designate source of funds so that the Indigent Defender Board can consider funding Boyer's case at an August 26 meeting.   So this is -- okay.   Lorenzi moves to continue September 12, 2003.   Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion to designate funds in trial so that the IDB may again consider the funding defense at its next meeting.   December 15, Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion to designate funds, et cetera.   There are many of these motions.   What do we do with those? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --Your Honor, I'd suggest that this Court does exactly the same thing that the Louisiana Court of Appeal did with them, which was to find that it was the lack of funding, not any action by Mr. Lorenzi, which caused the delay.   The Louisiana Court of Appeal declined to adopt the State's argument that it was Mr. Lorenzi's fault.   And the reason it did that was because the lack of a funding hearing caused no delay at all in the conduct of this trial.   The funding hearing when conducted produced no funding, no ruling or order and had no influence on the date of the trial.   And, of course, the right at issue was the right to go to trial, not to -- the time of the pretrial hearings.   Furthermore, all of those continuances which were joined in by the State were related to trying to identify and find funding for this case and for this man.   None of them were for a dilatory purpose.   They were because a new procedure was in -- occupies to submit bills in a different way to the IDB, because the Louisiana Supreme Court had accepted the citizen -- and ultimately-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I mean, Justice Alito's problem seemed to me, to get back to Justice Scalia's point, is that he seemed more interested in the funding than a speedy trial.   The funding that would be provided by the State under its procedures. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --In the absence of funding, there was no trial to be had.   At the funding hearing -- or I'm sorry -- at the motion to quash hearing in November 2006, there was a colloquy between the trial court and the prosecutor in which the trial court said, What are we going to do with this case?   They can't have a defense without money.   This was not, absolutely not-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " And as Justice Alito pointed out on several occasions, what the defense lawyer said was, Let's put it off and see if we can get funding, let's put it off until there's the funding hearing.   Let's put it off and put it off as opposed to saying, I want a speedy trial, I'm entitled to it now, if you don't have the money, I don't get a speedy trial, I get off scot-free. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --Well, under Louisiana's Article 701, there was no filing a motion for speedy trial, saying, Please give me a speedy trial, set a date now.   And at the same time-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " The Constitution requires such a motion.   I mean, I don't care whether they have a, you know, a speedy trial motion.   If denying him the right to speedy trial violates the Constitution, surely he is entitled to bring that to the attention of the Louisiana court, whether there's a specific statutory or rule provision or not. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --Your Honor, this Court in Barker, when dealing with this very topic under the issue of assertion, specifically said it would allow judges to take account of assertion in accordance with local procedural requirements.   The local procedural requirement in a State that already has its own statutory prescriptive period, if you don't bring second-degree murder to trial within two years, you're out.   The -- Louisiana does not need a defendant to tell them that they have to bring a speedy trial, and they don't want a defendant doing it unless they're ready to go to trial themselves.   They don't want the sort of pro forma assertion that was rejected. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Now, they -- they don't even want counsel to say, you know, Your Honor, we've been trying to get funding, and we're just sick and tired of waiting for this.   We demand a speedy trial, and if we don't get funding and therefore don't get a speedy trial, we think there's a constitutional violation and we're going to ask that the indictment be dismissed.   Nobody ever made a statement like that to the Court, did they? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " In July of 2005-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What did you say?

And it was still another 2 years before the funding crisis was solved.   So there was a very lengthy period if such notice were required, and that is not, in our submission, the message from Barker and the message from Article 701, they got that notice in July 2005, when there was the motion to quash.   And returning to your question-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But wasn't there something about that motion was withdrawn, the 2005 motion was withdrawn in 2006?

Does this -- this come from French law or something?   It seems to me withdrawing and dismissing sound to me the same thing.

So it was withdrawn, right? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --No, it was dismissed.   He chose dismiss rather than withdraw is the word and what he intended by that was that he wasn't saying, I don't want one; he was saying, I can't bring the type of hearing Louisiana courts require to get my Six Amendment motion to quash granted. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I think what you -- let's go back to that.   It was his view that under Louisiana law to assert his Sixth Amendment right, he had to follow the procedure laid out in the Louisiana rule?

So then how do you -- if he couldn't do it in 2002, '03, '04 or '05, how did he end up doing it in '05? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " It's the difference between moving for a speedy trial, Please give me a trial date, I want to go to trial next week, and moving to quash because the speedy trial right has been violated. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So why didn't he move to quash earlier? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " He moved to quash at the first moment that it became available under the State statute, which was at the 3-year mark.   He moved 1 month after that 3-year mark as soon as it became available. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry.   Is there a law or a regulation in -- in Louisiana that gives it a 3-year mark? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   Article 579 and following provides that the State must bring a first-degree murder charge to trial within 3 years or the case is proscribed, the indictment must be dismissed with prejudice.   And so the State always knew it had that deadline.   It didn't even set a trial date for a period of over 3 years in the middle of this, didn't even try to set a trial date for 3-1/2 years, didn't bring Mr. Boyer into court for 3-1/2 years to address his case at all.   And so as soon as the remedy available became open, as Judge Cook said in her opinion, defense counsel filed using exactly the remedy provided for.

And then our third argument, Your Honor, would be that, based under the Barker v. Wingo jurisprudence, the delay should not be attributed to the State in this case because of Petitioner's failure to meaningfully assert his right to a speedy trial.

All that counsel did was to say again and again: Pay me; get the funds to pay me.

Wigley and, although he referenced wanting expert resources as well, he primarily based that motion on his entitlement to attorney's fees.

It had been used extensively.   Now, by the time we get to the funding hearing, which was delayed because of Mr. Lorenzi, we are in 2006.   At that time there is a backlog in expenses that they are paying other capital counsel, because they pay their bills on a first come, first served basis.

The fact that there weren't funds available readily in 2006 is directly attribute to Petitioner's counsel's failing to move his funding herein forward in 2003, when he first identified that source of funds.   This is not a case in which there was never any funding.   This was a case in which defense counsel, for whatever reason, delayed a resolution of the funding issue, an issue that he himself identified as one, without any resolution he was not going to go forward with substantive motions.

What's your position then?   Then it's not deliberate?   It's still negligence? "}, {"speaker": "Carla S. Sigler", "text": " --Justice Sotomayor, I maintain that position, and I believe it to be consistent with this Court's repeated analysis under Barker v. Wingo jurisprudence.   You do look at the intent of the State as either a negligence factor, akin to more of a neutral factor, a deliberate factor, or a valid reason for the delay.   And I would also suggest to Your Honor-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So there could never be a systematic breakdown in your judgment, because any time the State gives resources to something else, it's not deliberate -- it's not a systemic breakdown. "}, {"speaker": "Carla S. Sigler", "text": " --Justice Sotomayor, I would invite you to look at the motion for funding hearing again.   There was money allocated to indigent defense by Louisiana.   It has increased, and this is public record and it's partially supported by the funding hearing.   That money has increased from 9.4 million in 2006 to 20 million in 2 -- I'm sorry -- in 2005 to 20 million in 2006 to $33 million today.   House Bill 1 of the State legislative web site.   That is the precise amount prosecutors are awarded by the State.   I would, again, suggest that this is not a case of systemic breakdown.   And I think that as a policy matter, this Court should be reluctant to rule against the State of Louisiana, which as Justice Scalia noted, has been so generous in trying to provide capital indigent defendants with specially qualified counsel, which is more counsel than they're even entitled to under the Sixth Amendment.   And I would also urge this Court to be cognizant of its own repeated statements in the past that this is a very severe remedy with regard to letting a convicted murderer free.   I'd also like to address before I sit down and turn this back over to Mr. Bourke, Justice Ginsburg, earlier you had addressed the question of whether or not the armed robbery was in fact still a valid charge.   Contrary to Mr. Bourke's assertion before Your Honor today, if you look at Appendix 254A, there is a writ of opposition that was filed by the Petitioner before the Louisiana Supreme Court, and at 254A he says, and I quote:   \"Even if the murder indictment were quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery prosecution. \"   The Third Circuit also rejected Mr. Bourke's current double jeopardy argument and stated specifically that there was no speedy trial problem with regard to the armed robbery.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Bourke, you have about 3 minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Thank you.   And I have a few points of clarification that I want to make just in a very quick fashion.   Justice Sotomayor, there was no funding in 2001, 2002, 2003.   It was never there.   If Your Honor looks at the Louisiana Supreme Court opinion in Citizen, it will describe the Turner case funding hearing in 2001.   Mr. Lorenzi was stuck with that one as well.   There was no money.   Mr. Lorenzi did indeed submit bills in 2003, because a new procedure had been announced, and that's at page -- Joint Appendix page 401 to '3.   You'll see the correspondence showing he did submit bills and there was no money. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There was money allocated, but if I understood the record correctly -- by the State -- the funding was grossly inadequate to cover all the needs? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Right.   It was underwater.   It was oversubscribed.   It-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Mr. Bourke, would you respond to the last point made by -- by opposing counsel? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " --Yes, certainly. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You did state, it's in Appendix J, even if the murder indictment were quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery prosecution. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You told us today that that's not the case, that the armed robbery prosecution goes down the drain.   Which is true? "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " The passage you're referring to is from a writ application purely limited to the application of the State speedy trial statute, which does accord a new clock to every new filing.   So under Louisiana State statutory law, the armed robbery started the State statutory clock again, but that is not the case for the Sixth Amendment. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " As to the murder or as to the independent robbery count?   It's not a lesser included offense, the robbery count. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " The armed robbery was a lesser included of first-degree murder, but it is not a lesser included of second-degree murder.   Our double jeopardy argument was the same force was applied in both, the force for the murder and the force for the armed robbery.   So that's completely irrelevant.   But that was a State statutory argument about the armed robbery charge which has no application in the case in front of us. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Boyer -- why would-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --Why would we get to that question?   I mean, no courts below have dealt with it.   It has been briefed to us in a grand total of two paragraphs, I think.   There would be no reason for us to get to that question. "}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " It is well beyond the question presented, Your Honor, I agree.   Your Honor, the-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So -- so from that point of view, we can assume that there is a robbery conviction that is still out there.

"}, {"speaker": "Richard Bourke", "text": " That -- that is why this Court would remand to allow the -- the local court to deal with it, and ensure that that's accurate.   Justice Breyer, the reference to our earlier -- the decision of this Court and the supreme court is a reference to the earlier decision on the interlocutory writ application, the earlier decision that a lack of adequate funds prevented the prosecution.   And if Your Honor looks at Joint Appendix at page 126, which is part of the opinion of the Third Circuit, you will see earlier in their opinion they discuss their own earlier ruling on the supreme court-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
