[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in case 15-1406 Goodyear v. Haeger. Mr. Bergeron? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A direct causation standard is necessary in light of the historic restrictions on a court's inherent authority, and it provides courts with a workable framework that they customarily apply in the sanctions context.   Respondents, in fact, acknowledge that a direct causation standard applies, sometimes, but not always. Their two-teared suggestion, however, does not provide concrete guidance to the district courts and it would inevitably lead to the expansion of the inherent authority. One of the reasons this Court has been reticent about any sort of broadening of the scope of the inherent authority is because the due-process issues and separation of powers issues combined with a court determining the violation acting essentially as prosecutor and fact finder and then imposing the penalty. And -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How do you -- am I to take that your -- I think what I read from your brief is that we should draw the line that we drew in Bagli between compensatory damages under the contempt inherent power and punishment damages that require criminal civil procedures. Is that the same thing you're asking us to -- "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Yes. That's essentially the same thing. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how do you deal with Chambers? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " So we deal with Chambers a couple of different ways.   First of all, Chambers factually distinguishably different from our case because Chambers was based purely on pervasive misconduct that was so bad that it tainted the entire case because there was no -- there was no good faith defense at the end of the day. We have the good faith defense here. But secondly -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Wasn't, that wasn't that what was found here was that it was pervasive from the very first effort to get discovery continuing through the settlement? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " No, Justice Ginsburg.   In fact, what the Court found ultimately was it recognized it did not resolve the question whether the Heat Rise test was dispositive.   And it said plaintiffs believe it would be helpful, but it did not make a determination of that.   And in light of that, we had good-faith defenses as to even if the tests were produced, that there was still a design defect.   And beyond that, there were also causation defenses as to the ultimate cause of the accident, whether that was driver error or whether there was impact damage. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But weren't you given the opportunity -- maybe you can clarify this -- the -- the Court said, well, if we're wrong about giving all of the counsel fees, then we will deduct -- what? -- some $700,000 based on Goodyear's filing of the amount that should not be recovered because it was unrelated to Goodyear's bad conduct. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Correct.   So there's two points on that. First of all, that was -- how that evolved was the Court had already ruled against us on the causation point; so we had lost that battle.   And then when we -- when the plaintiffs finally submitted their fee application, we took a fallback position and said, at a bare minimum, this needs to be carved out.   So we haven't waived that, but I think the second -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And you represented that that was the cost that was not attributable to Goodyear's misconduct. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " What we represented was that it was related to the medical costs, the medical damages -- proven up the medical damages, as well as pursuit of the other defendants.   So that would be one subset of the -- of the costs that were not caused by the misconduct, but it wasn't the total one. And what's significant about that as well is that the court said it's impossible to make this calculation.   But then the court did, at least to a certain extent, make a calculation based on the evidence that was submitted. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, your test is the direct directness of the causation.   And I -- I guess I'm curious as to how you would apply that in practice.   I mean, if you take a case, for example, they don't get the Heat Rise test, they get something else that isn't as, in their view -- "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- dramatic or compelling. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " And they have to go through all sorts of -- they're preparing somebody to testify about this other test, and they incur $100,000 in expenses to do that.   Is that something that would be directly caused by the failure to disclose the Heat Rise test? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " I think there's a couple of different ways you can look at it.   I think we -- we -- we gravitate towards the Fox test, which is the incremental harm.   So if you're going to engage in that litigation anyway, and you're going to engage in prepping that witness anyway -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, let's say they're not.   They say, you know, if we get the Heat Rise test, that's -- that's much more dramatic.   We don't need to worry about, you know, this less compelling test. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " I think there certainly could be situations where -- where the proponent of fees would say, we would not have taken this deposition if we had had this document, for instance, and then that would -- that could be something that they would then recover for. I think generally what you're looking at is -- is the incremental costs going above a baseline. And that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's always a guess-estimate to start with.   Guess-estimate, I use it in its colloquial sense of you're -- you're looking at what happened and you're cutting broadly at the lines because you can never set the line precisely. But as Justice -- as the Chief Justice said on the Heat Rise test, there was one expert that was questioned, but would have been questioned in a totally different way if the proper tests had been disclosed. Why was that causal decision by the district court wrong? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Well, we think that they could recover for that expert.   And, in fact, you know, the district court never got into the actual analysis of causation. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, but they -- they -- the district court asked you to tell them what you thought wasn't caused, assuming that you accepted the district court's findings. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Well, in fairness, the district court told us we -- we were not going to be able to do that.   And we -- that's -- that's how the 700,000 came up, because we took a fallback position and tried to say, well, at a bare minimum, these things are so far attenuated, so far removed from any misconduct, that has to be removed.   But you need to -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, to be precise about that, what were you asked by the district judge to submit? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " So what happened was before the district court issued its November 2012 order, we had raised -- they -- they had requested all sorts of remedies for sanctions, and we had raised the causation point, the causation limitation.   The district court rejected that in the November 2012 order and said, no, you get everything. And so in response, the plaintiffs filed a three-page fee application that said give us everything, along with all of their time records. So then in response to that, that's where we filed our opposition and said, you know, that's where we raised the issue of -- of the 700,000 as being too far removed.   But we -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So why isn't it appropriate, given that the plaintiff was put to a great expense and probably got less in the settlement than they would have gotten if Goodyear had lived up to its discovery responsibilities, why isn't it appropriate to say instead of making the plaintiff prove every single item that's attributable to the discovery fault, it should be the defendant's expert to point out what -- what items were not attributable? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " I think there's both a practical and a legal answer to that.   The practical answer is because they are the ones that incurred the fees, they are in the best position to say these fees were incurred as a result of the misconduct.   And I think if you look at all the sanction regimes, the burden is on the proponent to establish the propriety of the award. The legal answer is that Bagwell, although it doesn't squarely address this point, does seem to indicate that it is the proponent that needs to establish the causation link.   And I believe, Justice Ginsburg, your concurrence seemed to -- to echo that as well.   And then when you look at Alyeska, that case said, look, we want to be apprehensive about shifting the litigation burdens, admittedly in a slightly different context, without legislative guidance.   And, of course, that's part of the problem here is there is no legislative guidance, which is the reason that there needs to be a causation check on the inherent authority. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Bergeron, could I go back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you. You said that you favored the approach of Fox v. Vice, which is a but-for test. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It's would you have incurred this cost anyway even -- "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- without the misconduct. But Fox v. Vice never uses this language of directness, which seems to me actually much more in line with proximate cause inquiries. Now, Fox v. Vice, you know, never addressed proximate cause either way.   It wasn't a proximate cause fact pattern.   This actually seems not really a proximate cause fact pattern either; it just seems as though it's a -- you know, should there be a but-for test. So I guess I'm wondering, where does this language of -- you say \"but for,\" but you also say \"direct.\" What do you mean when you use those two terms? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " We borrowed \"direct\" from Cooter & Gell and from the other sanction regimes that all have various iterations of what I call direct causation.   Now, they may refer to it as direct effect; they may refer to it as direct result.   But at the end of the day.   That's what they're applying. Now, we looked at Fox v. Vice and saw essentially the same analysis, because what those cases are trying to determine in -- in the other sanction regimes is, what is the excess cost? And Fox approached that slightly differently, looking at it -- calling it incremental costs, calling it but-for.   So, essentially, we think the tests are synonymous.   And the reason that it's a little bit different than, say, proximate cause is because we're dealing with the American rule and -- and coming up with an exception to the American rule. But, obviously, the exception is not -- it's not an all-or-nothing claim, and obviously Fox made that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, suppose we say that the Fox v. Vice but-for test is something along the lines of what we should be applying here.   So how does -- in your reply brief, you basically say that a court can \"never.\" You don't -- you don't just say in this case it was wrong.   In your reply brief, you say a court can never say, look, the case would have settled right away, and all costs ought to go to the victimized party. Why is that? If it's a but-for test, why couldn't a court on a proper set of facts say, look, if this -- if this abuse hadn't occurred, this case would just never have gone on? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " We think that that is just far too speculative to satisfy a direct causation test. And, obviously, in this case, it really illustrates the point, because the district court said, I'm pointing to Goodyear's experience in other cases.   But in those cases, it went all the way to or through trial. But -- but the other problem with this is -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I don't know what -- what -- too speculative.   I mean, the Court says, look, I understand that I have to find this; you know, that it's more likely than not.   That's how we make findings about what costs would have been incurred anyway. Would -- you know, there's never any certainty.   We're always saying more likely than not, would this cost have been incurred? I think none of the costs of this suit would have been incurred if this abuse hadn't taken place. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " But we think the problem with that is it ends up being a shortcut for causation. And -- and the Court, then, is excused from the performance of the task of actually looking at what the misconduct was and how that impacted the fees incurred. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I think it's pretty easy to think of hypotheticals and how they might be unrealistic, in which the eventual disclosure of some piece of information that should have been disclosed a lot earlier is so fatal to the defense that the case would be settled as soon as that came to light. You think it's impossible to imagine something like that? Suppose there were some internal Goodyear document here that said, you know, we are going to sell this.   We are going to market this to RVs, but we know it's really not suitable for RVs.   And so if people put it on an RV and they are driving around in a hot climate, the tire is going to explode. I mean, if you had an internal document like that, it wouldn't be very hard to say, wow, once this comes out, we are going to have no option but to settle the issue of liability. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " And I can certainly imagine such a document.   But the problem with that is if the document shows that the entire litigation is not in good faith, I think that's a different issue.   That's getting closer to Chambers. But if it doesn't do that, the problem with using a potential settlement date as the barometer for causation here is -- I can't tell you how many mediations I've walked into when knowing my client's risk tolerance and what I thought the other side was going to say, I said, this case is going to settle. Absolutely it's going to settle today and it doesn't happen.   It just ends up being too speculative because you can't -- you would have to really pierce the privilege on both sides to get any sort of determination as to whether they would actually settle. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yes, but if a lack of certainty like that is going to prevent a judge from actually making an award, then people on the other side, people who are victimized, are going to be undercompensated in case after case after case. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " But I don't think that that's the case here because, obviously, if a direct causation test is applied and they get the incremental cost that they would have received in the absence of the misconduct, then they received the appropriate compensatory award and it satisfies the due process concerns. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Justice Sotomayor asked you at the outset about the Chambers cases.   I just can't find really strong language in this Chambers case from which to imply a causation or draw a causation conclusion.   And Bagwell doesn't even cite Chambers. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Right.   Chambers was not engaging in the same causation analysis that we are talking about today. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " No, it wasn't.   I know. Clearly it was not.   But why shouldn't it have? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Well, because what Chambers was recognizing was it did acknowledge that all of the fees were caused by the misconduct, and it did point out that the entirety of the case was built on a fraud, and there was no good faith defense to the litigation.   So in that circumstance -- and, of course, the district court in Chambers says, this is unique.   And it probably is a unique situation. But then when we move to Bagwell, the other point about Chambers is it was built on the foundation of contempt.   And so it was built on the contempt cases in distilling a rule from those.   But then that changed with Bagwell because we have the clarification on the distinction between criminal and civil, and Bagwell was drawing that line at causation.   And that's why, to the extent there is any tension between Chambers and Bagwell, Bagwell should prevail on that point. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Am I to understand the question presented -- as presented was whether there is a direct causation standard applicable to an award under a court's inherent powers.   And you're now saying we wanted a but-for incremental cost analysis to define direct cause.   Then ask your adversary how he would define it if it was going to be applied. But you're also asking us to actually apply it in your case.   And to review the district court's findings de novo or on abuse of discretion? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " The district court would be reviewed under abuse of discretion.   And our point is the Court applied the wrong legal test which constitutes an abuse of discretion.   We think ultimately that the Court should remand to the district court to allow the Court to apply the direct causation test that the court declined to apply the first time around. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " When the district court gave these two awards, the 2.7 and the 2 million, do you understand that to have been 2.7 if I'm not bound by a cause requirement; 2 million if I am? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " I think that's how the court envisioned it, yes, Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So then why hasn't that been done already in the district court? In other words, if you're right, that there is a causation requirement here, we send it back to the district court, hasn't the district court already performed that calculation? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " I think that would be what the Respondents would say.   And their whole argument on that is that we waive anything beyond the 700,000.   My point is that we preserve that and, therefore, the Court would need to go through and -- go through the exercise of actually applying a direct causation test on these facts as they are here. And I think what -- if you look at what the district court did, it found very specific dates of misconduct.   So you could look at those dates of misconduct, what those episodes were, and then compare them to the time records. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What's the difference between the 2 million and the 2.7? What is the $700,000 in there; costs for what? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " The $700,000 represented the fees incurred in pursuit of the other defendants, because there were two other defendants in the underlying litigation besides Goodyear.   So saying, look, if you're pursuing those other defendants, it's clearly not being impacted by the misconduct of Goodyear. And then the second was proving up medical damages because you're going to have to prove up -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " When you gave this figure to the district court you said, in your submission, \"Goodyear reviewed plaintiffs' billing entries and created a category of cost.\" I'm quoting you.   \"Unrelated to the alleged harm and outside the scope of the court's order.\" So if that was your definition of what was unrelated to the harm, what's left for the district court to do? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " And I understand that.   I understand the point we made.   We did preserve in the first footnote of that filing that we were preserving our Miller argument which had been raised previously. Miller was a Ninth Circuit decision, they didn't impose direct causation in our view. And so our point is we understand if you disagree with us and say, we waive that; then that would be the remedy.   My point, though, is that because the direct causation analysis was never done in the first place, there would need to be a remand for that exercise to take place. And I think it's important as you look at what the district court found, and this gets back to, you know, why is this not like Chambers.   The district court found that the discovery costs were inflated by the misconduct and that the case would have been more complicated -- was rendered more complicated by the misconduct.   But that assumes that there was a baseline for how litigation should have proceeded.   And then there is a difference, and that difference there is capable of determination.   And that's the point that we are raising in terms of that this is something that can be quantifiable. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What costs do you concede you're responsible for? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " We would concede we are responsible for the direct harm flowing from the misconduct that the district court found.   And that would include the expert discovery, the deposition of Mr. Osborn and any related preparation or follow-up to that deposition, the efforts to get the tests, if there was discovery requests or negotiations or discovery, perhaps a status conference, the Olsen deposition where the district court found misconduct in the preparing for and following up on that deposition, and then the hearings where the misconduct occurred and any preparation for those. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So how much is that? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " I don't have a number for you, Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But that's not anything like the full 2 million? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " It's not.   It would not be. And ultimately, I don't want to be exclusive here because the challenge is we never had an actual fee application that says, these are the categories of fees that were incurred as a result of your misconduct and then we could respond to that.   We never had that, because the district court said, you get everything.   So they said, we want everything.   And so they may have other categories that they would say and then we would debate that before the district court. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You said you wanted to use the Fox v. Vice standard, and part of that is the but-for causation inquiry.   And part of that is a pretty clear statement that we don't expect district court judges to be, you know, green eye-shade accountants, is I think what we called them. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " To go over each, you know, hour of an attorney's work.   We understand the district courts are going to have to make some broad categories and some guesstimates.   Do you agree with that too? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " We do.   I mean, there is certainly going to be discretion by the district court. We actually think that this test is going to be easier to apply at the end of the day, because if it's incumbent upon the proponent to say -- to internalize a direct causation but-for test, and then make the arguments and say, these are the categories of fees that were incurred as a result of misconduct and then here is the concomitant fee -- time entries, that would be -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What do you -- what do you do then with the plaintiff's position that this case would have settled much earlier, which the district judge accepted? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " And we would say that that's an inappropriate basis for the reasons I said earlier, an inappropriate basis as a substitute for causation. Allowing the court to use a cutoff date and just sweep everything going forward would be inappropriate.   But even if you disagreed with me on that, as Judge Watford noted in dissent, there was no record support for that conclusion by the district judge. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Suppose there was a finding made in another case that the case would have settled much earlier.   Then what? "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Then I would go back to my first point which is that's an inappropriate basis upon which to obviate the need for causation, that the Court should not be getting into a temporal line drawing in terms of how we determine what fees may or may not have been caused by misconduct. Instead, it would be looking at, you know, what are the categories that were caused by the misconduct and making those calculations going forward. But -- but once you start -- once you sanction the ability to just draw a temporal line in the sand, then I think that makes it too easy for courts to avoid, actually, the -- the hard work sometimes -- some cases can be easy -- but the harder work of going through and looking at the -- the ultimate time entries. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if you're not -- and I -- I thought you admitted earlier that it wouldn't be appropriate for us to say that could never happen, or maybe I misunderstood your answer. But suppose we think that there could be circumstances in which a court could say this would have settled based on the fatal nature of the disclosure. This would have settled sooner, had it been properly disclosed.   You would have to fall back on a rule that says this is never -- it -- although a court is sometimes permitted to do this, legal rule has to be it has to be done only in the clearest of cases or something like that. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Well, and that's why I go kind of with my -- with my first point, which is we shouldn't be -- once you start going down -- once you open the door to that, I think there is a problem on the application.   And what we are trying to do is provide a rule that is workable and can be internalized by the district court. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Is it odd that the -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " In other words, the more egregious the -- the -- the violation the harder it is to show causation.   That seems odd. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " Well, no, Justice Kennedy, I disagree.   Because the -- the point is if you -- if you engage in more misconduct, you are going to necessarily generate more fees in response to that, and there is obviously a deterrent effect of this award. The -- the lead counsel no longer practices law, Your Honors, and this order is going to follow Goodyear for years.   And -- and this is -- whether the award is $2.7 million or a million dollars, it has significant deterrent effect, and obviously, we are dealing with follow-on litigation going beyond this. But that this is something that, at -- at the end of the day, if there is an appropriate causation test applied, then the proponent of sanction gets made whole by that, and it satisfies any due process concerns. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- but, Mr. Bergeron, you're saying well, you should use a causation test, but you can't ever consider the likelihood of settlement. But the likelihood of settlement might be -- might not be here, but might be in another case, quite relevant to the question of what fees have been caused by the misconduct. "}, {"speaker": "Pierre H. Bergeron", "text": " It -- and I -- so what I would say to that is yes, you could envision a case where that might happen.   At -- at -- on the facts of this case, it couldn't.

Egbert", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court and the Ninth Circuit in this case both acknowledge that there needs to be a causal link between the sanction misconduct and the fees and costs awarded as sanctions.

One is that, on a very simple level, if we had the very strong evidence of the -- that was concealed here that showed that the tire was defective, and -- because of the -- the Heat Rise test and that evidence, that it may have been that we would not have needed to go against any of the -- the other defendants at all.

But they -- the Ninth Circuit says the district court did all it was required to do in this case in determining the appropriate amount of fees to award as sanctions to compensate the plaintiffs for the damages they suffered as a result of sanctionee's bad faith.   And then they went on, they expressly said in this -- we next consider how close a link is required between the harm caused and the compensatory sanctions. Part of the confusion that exists here is that Goodyear argued -- when they argued direct causation initially, and even in the Ninth Circuit, they were arguing a different concept than they do today. What they were advocating for was that the trial court judge needed to go through the billing statements, and with respect to each line item, directly link it to a specific instance of misconduct.   The trial court judge says, I don't have to do that. When she rejected that direct causation, it was that that was sanctionee's argument of that concept that she was rejecting.   She didn't reject the concept that there had to be a causation, some compensatory aspect of this. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, why did she say -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

It -- it's close to that, but what it was, was that, if I'm bound by what they are saying that I'm bound by, that I have to go through each of the billing record -- each billing line item and link it to an individual instance of misconduct, if I'm wrong on that, then I'm going to give you -- I'm going to do an alternative award. And -- and let me address for a moment what was asked earlier about whether or not that's been waived.   Because they did, in fact, make the argument that the 700,000 were all that was causally linked. They didn't argue anything else was -- was suffered from the causal link deficiency. What they argued was just the 700,000.   And they -- they now claim that they preserved it in a footnote in their -- in their papers.   But what's significant is if you look at their Ninth Circuit brief, they didn't argue anything beyond the 700,000 there, either. So it's really in this Court for the first time that they seek to expand beyond the 700,000.   We -- we say that's too late, that they -- they had a chance to argue the causal link deficiency and they did, but it was only to 700,000, and that they should be held to that.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You said you were going to respond to Justice Alito's statements from the Ninth Circuit.   I have another one to give you. I mean, this is the closest, it seems to me, as to a standard that comes from the Ninth Circuit, that the district court awarded the amount that the Court reasonably believed it cost the Haegers to litigate against a party during the time when that party was acting in bad faith.   So it seems to me that the Ninth Circuit was viewing this chronologically.   When the party was acting in bad faith, all of those costs are -- and fees are appropriate. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Egbert", "text": " Well, I -- I disagree respectfully, Your Honor.   I think what the Ninth Circuit concluded based on the totality of the district court's extensive findings was that this evidence that was concealed and all the related deceits were so important to the plaintiff's claims and so devastating to Goodyear's defense that it -- that it caused the entire litigation as a whole to be a sham.   And that's the language that the Ninth Circuit said, we're -- we're going to -- we believe that the whole thing was a sham. And so to use a train analogy, most sanction cases involved misconduct that merely delays the train or perhaps ultimately -- you know, causes a detour.   But ultimately, that train arrives at the intended station. In this case, the -- what the district court found, and which the Ninth Circuit agreed, was that the train jumped track and it went in an entirely wrong direction. It didn't even try the case that the claims that -- that my clients had.   It -- it tried the case based on a false set of facts and never, ever -- it was never -- because the misconduct was never discovered during the course of this litigation, it was a completely empty charade.   It didn't try the real facts of this case.   It tried what Goodyear allowed us to have only. And so because the whole thing was a sham, the district court appropriately said, you know, the whole thing was wasted.   It was a wasted effort and, therefore, I'm exercising my discretion in -- in holding that the whole thing should be reimbursed.   I've got to put you back in the position you were before you started down, jumped track, and went in the wrong direction completely.   And that's what she awarded. And -- and who gets to make that kind of a decision? That's a factual determination.   The judge in this case was entitled to make a determination of what was the central issue in the case? How crucial was this evidence to that central issue? What was the impact of not having that? I think all of those are the types of factual determinations that we want district court judges to make. And to Justice -- and to Justice Alito's hypothetical, there can be situations where the -- it can be so devastating that it really could be -- a court could appropriately find that it would have settled at this point and that -- this is such a case.   This is a case where the judge, in the exercise of her discretion, made that determination and that we should be -- the -- the appellate court should be upholding that.

A good example of this is Rule 37.   Rule 37 governs production of documents and the failure to produce documents.   That could have been something the district court relied on here, and there is a causation requirement.
