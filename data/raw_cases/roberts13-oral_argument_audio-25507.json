[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument, we'll continue argument, in Case 22-535, Department of Education versus Brown. Welcome back. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Across the board, Brown and Taylor's arguments in this case run counter to precedent and principle.   On standing, Respondents' asserted injury is a complete mismatch for the relief they seek.   They claim to want greater loan forgiveness than the plan provides, but they ask this Court to hold that the HEROES Act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness at all. A win on that theory would mean that no one could get any HEROES Act relief, not Brown, who would get nothing for herself, not Taylor, who would lose $10,000, and not any of the millions of borrowers who need this critical relief.   Respondents lack standing to seek that result.   Parties cannot go to court to make themselves and everyone else worse off. To get around that problem, Brown and Taylor gesture at the idea that if the Secretary can't act under the HEROES Act, he might consider making an entirely different decision to grant debt relief under the Education Act. But, on the merits, Respondents are broadly attacking the whole idea of providing loan forgiveness under any executive action. They never explain why they think the Secretary could provide broader relief to even more borrowers under the Education Act. And, in any event, this Court has never endorsed that kind of circuitous route to standing.   A plaintiff who isn't injured by agency action can't establish standing by speculating that invalidating that -- that action might prompt the agency to take an entirely different action under a different statute. If the Court reaches the merits, it should reject Respondents' claim.   They argue the plan is unlawful because the Secretary didn't use certain rulemaking procedures.   But Congress specifically exempted the Secretary from following those procedures when he issues waivers and modifications under the HEROES Act. Respondents' procedural claim fails in light of that clear statutory exemption. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Are there any instances in which you would have procedural standing? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " So I think that if they wanted to argue that the Secretary should have reconsidered his decision under the HEROES Act to grant broader relief, then it's possible that they could have raised both a procedural claim and a substantive claim because, at that point, their injury would be redressable.   They would be saying that the Secretary drew arbitrary lines, that the plan should be expanded to include them and to provide relief to them, and that would be a very straightforward route to making the arguments if what they really want is loan forgiveness. But, instead, their whole argument here is that the Secretary can't give them or anyone else relief under the HEROES Act.   And when you look at it that way, there is no case that we've been able to find, and we've really tried to boil the oceans here, that could plausibly support that theory of procedural injury. It would blow open the doors to asserting Article III injury when you are not directly affected by an agency action and, by your own lights, you can't stand to benefit from any ruling on that agency action merely because you think that if you can block it, you could -- the -- the agency might reach out and look for some other source of authority to regulate and make a new action. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The -- this action has nothing to do with their right if they thought it was permissible to seek relief under the Education Act, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " That's correct. It's a -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They could -- "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " -- it's a totally different source of authority.   If they want relief under the Education Act, there are provisions where they can file a petition for rulemaking and ask for that relief right now. And it's not as though these are mutually exclusive sources of authority.   The Education Act is -- is not directed to national emergencies.   It's not -- it's an independent source of authority here, unlike the HEROES Act, which is the action they're challenging that's specifically focused on this agency -- this national emergency situation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I understand your argument on standing, and I -- I know this isn't directly on point, but, when I saw it, it's sort of like the equal protection cases, you know, where discrimination between men and women on the -- the level of pensions and the women -- widows get more and the widowers get less, and the challenge is brought and the argument was, well, if you win, we're going to take the excess away from the -- the widows, so you're not going to get anything, so you don't have standing. Why is that case -- I appreciate the way in which it's different, but why isn't that at least some authority on which they can rely? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " I -- I think that the equal protection cases are fundamentally different because, there, your injury is your complaint of unequal treatment.   And so, whether you level up or level down, your injury is being redressed.   You're no longer being subject to unequal treatment, and, instead, everyone is being subject to the same treatment. But this case stands in a very different posture because, here, their argument is our injury is we're not getting loan forgiveness, and the -- the relief they're seeking, which is a declaration that the HEROES Act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness in the first place, doesn't redress that injury one bit. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Right, but it's -- it's -- "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " It just carves it into stone. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Right.   But, I mean, without looking after the case, yes, you could lower it or -- or raise it, but that's an uncertainty that had -- that we did not -- we decided that that did not affect their right to bring the action because it may be changed in a particular way. And I suppose their argument would be that, you know, they are injured by not being -- participating in the program, and if the program is struck down in its current form, it may be changed in a particular way that would help them. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " So I think that there is, though, a complete disconnect between the claim of injury.   And it's true that in the equal protection context, you don't know ex ante what the remedy is going to be.   But the Court has determined that doesn't affect standing because, either way, no matter what remedy occurs, based on the equal protection injury, it's going to fix the nature of the harm of providing unequal treatment. And, here, the -- the only certainty is that if they prevail on their claims, it's going to make it harder to provide them or anyone else with debt relief.   Their suggestion here that the Secretary wholly lacks this authority under the HEROES Act and their assertion of arguments to support that claim that broadly attack this whole concept of loan forgiveness, I think, demonstrate that we're far afield from the equal protection case law. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Can I just ask you, I -- I had understood them to be complaining about the procedures.   Am I completely off base here? Are you suggesting that they are complaining about not getting enough loan forgiveness or something? Maybe I misheard you, but I thought they were trying to bring a procedural claim in that the reason why this was problematic was because the procedures that they are saying are lacking are actually under the other source of authority, that they -- that if we looked at the source of authority that the Secretary used in this scenario, it doesn't guarantee them those procedures, so you can't really complain about not getting procedures in another -- under another statute that was not invoked in -- in this situation. Am I wrong about this? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " No.   And I understand the confusion because -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " -- the -- the -- the theory here is a little convoluted, and so let me try to unpack it.   They are asserting a procedural injury, but what they're saying is we want an opportunity to comment on loan forgiveness so it'll include us as well.   Our underlying injury is that, without having a chance to comment on the Secretary's use of authority under the HEROES Act, we didn't get a chance to advocate for us to be included in the plan. The problem with that procedural theory of harm is that by their own arguments in the case, the Secretary couldn't make a different decision.   He couldn't go back to the drawing board and think about it and decide, yes, I'm going to expand the plan under the HEROES Act to provide these borrowers with relief too.   So they aren't able to assert that kind of redressability for an asserted procedural injury under the HEROES Act. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And that's because there aren't negotiated procedures under the HEROES Act? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Right.   The statutory text is very clear.   So, even if you were to get to it on the merits, they haven't actually been deprived of any procedural rights. The HEROES Act specifies that waivers and modifications issued under the HEROES Act are exempt from notice-and-comment. But I think because of the fundamental flaw with their theory of injury and the fact that it couldn't be redressed by their own arguments in this case, they've now brought up this Education Act idea. They haven't been deprived of any procedural rights under the Education Act.   You know, procedural rights derive from specific agency decisions under agency authority.   So it's not as though they have some procedural right in the ether to just comment on the concept of loan forgiveness writ large. Instead, under the HEROES Act, as we've just discussed, there isn't a notice-and-comment procedural right, and under the Education Act, no decision has been made. And so they haven't been deprived of any procedure associated -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And so what they would -- "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " -- with that decision-making. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- so what they would need, I suppose, is certainty that if they -- if we -- if we nullify the authority of the Secretary to do what it did in the HEROES Act, that there would necessarily be a loan forgiveness program under the HEA? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Yes.   And they can't make anything like that showing here. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " It's total speculation on their part to suggest that if the Secretary is blocked from taking this action, maybe he'll look for a different source of authority and issue an entirely different program under that source of authority.   And I think that that shows that their -- their theory is unduly speculative here. I think it's important to recognize as well why they're pressing this claim and the upshot of this theory.   The reason they're asking the Court to go down this road is so that they can effectively raise a substantive challenge to the HEROES Act. That was actually the only claim on which they prevailed below.   The district court in this case rejected their assertions of procedural harm and instead went on to resolve a standalone substantive challenge to the Secretary's plan and said that it was unlawful under the HEROES Act. But they've now entirely abandoned that basis for prevailing below.   They say that the district court was wrong to consider that. They're not defending that ruling. And it makes good sense because they obviously lack standing to maintain a substantive standalone challenge to the HEROES Act since that wouldn't do anything to redress their harm but instead just ensure that they aren't going to get any debt relief. By raising this procedural argument, though, they're effectively asking for an opportunity to raise the very same substantive claim that they lack standing to pursue through the guise of a procedural challenge to the Act. And there is no apparent reason for the Court to allow that kind of gambit and to take what is actually a substantive challenge based on a generalized grievance with how the executive is administering the law and alter the ordinary Article III standards to allow a plaintiff to revisit that conclusion through a procedural mechanism. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " General, I -- I appreciate your standing arguments and they've been laid out very clearly here. An interesting feature of this particular case is -- as you well know, is that the Court entered a universal decree.   We -- we've chatted about this in prior cases. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " We have indeed, Justice Gorsuch.

"}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Yes, yes, for -- for two individual borrowers is the set-aside language. But, as we've explained, that language, which comes from Section 706 of the APA, if you look back and trace through what Congress was doing when it enacted the APA was not meant to be the remedial provision of the APA. Instead, that comes from Section 703, which tells you to either look at a special statutory review provision if one exists, and sometimes there are special statutory review provisions that say you can operate directly on the agency action at issue. But, in the absence of that, then it's the traditional equitable remedies that predated the APA, and there was nothing like this universal vacatur remedy then, which would take you far beyond party-specific relief.

In the absence of that, then, yes, our argument is you should provide party-specific relief, that the -- the traditional concepts of remedial authority under Article III were limited in that way and that to instead allow single district courts throughout the nation to claim the power to put a critical policy on hold is out of accord with -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

I want to come back to some of the claims that both sets of Respondents here have in common dealing with what we've called the arbitrary and capricious aspects of the case. And, as I understand it, the memorandum really talks about two things.   It talks about forbearance and it talks about sort of economics/COVID conditions, forbearance as a kind of separate thing that people who have been granted forbearance for long periods of time are more likely to go into default or become delinquent in their payments. And I guess I wonder, is that about COVID, or is that just about something that happens when you excuse loan payments for a long period of time and how it is that that gets to be converted into an emergency COVID rationale? And then, on the economic considerations, and I think it was Justice Barrett who talked about this a little, it seems, you know, a real mixture of COVID and non-COVID-related things. And, of course, this is how the economy works, that COVID interacts with other features of the economy to produce certain economic conditions, but, again, I'm wondering whether, you know, there was more of an obligation on the part of the Secretary to isolate how COVID was affecting these borrowers? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Of course.   And I'll take each of those considerations in turn. I'll start with your questions about forbearance, and I want to be really clear because I think my friends have confused the issue about this a little bit, that the Secretary wasn't finding that forbearance itself had caused the economic harm to borrowers or that it was the root cause of why they needed additional relief. Instead, the Secretary analyzed the historical data regarding forbearance as a data point in -- in understanding that forbearance is not always a complete solution to the underlying economic harm caused by the national emergency. So, here, there's no doubt that forbearance has provided very powerful and critical support to borrowers over the life of the COVID pandemic, but the Secretary found that once forbearance policy lifts, millions and millions of borrowers are going to be worse off with respect to their ability to pay because of The forbearance policy hasn't fixed the underlying economic harm of the -- of the pandemic and the emergency.   So, to the extent that there's a bootstrapping concern here, I just want to push back forcefully on that.   I think that the Secretary's decision memoranda makes clear that sometimes additional relief is necessary not because of forbearance but in spite of forbearance. To turn to your question about the various causes or influences of economic harm here, it's, of course, true that I can't make a representation that the harms that borrowers are facing are solely due to COVID-19.   But I think that it would be an impossible burden to place on the Secretary to suggest that he needs to isolate and identify just one economic factor or force that's causing that kind of distress for borrowers. You know, our -- our economy is very complex and there are often multiple factors and forces at play, but the Secretary here found, and I don't think that anyone could reasonably dispute, that but for COVID, borrowers would not be in this situation of facing severe financial harms and the very real risk that they'll have to go into default or delinquency when they start repaying their student loans. So I think, to the extent that there's concern here about how the standard could operate, at the very least, the Secretary made the requisite findings that these are financial harms that derive directly from and are a but-for result of the COVID pandemic. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, I'm -- I'm sure I'm misreading the graphs on -- I'm looking at 247, 248.   Didn't half the borrowers say they would not have any trouble paying their loans without regard to the forgiveness program? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " So it varies based on income bracket, and, yes, it's true that -- that in certain income brackets, the data I think reflected that, you know, 51 percent of borrowers expected that they would be unable to pay their student loans.   That wasn't the only -- the only data the Secretary consulted, though.   In those same studies that he referenced, there was general data about levels of financial insecurity, and overwhelming majorities of borrowers expressed huge financial insecurity concerns about their ability to make ends meet going 10 years into the future. And I think one of the important things to recognize, again, as I had mentioned in the last argument, is that it's not necessary for the Secretary to make a finding that each and every borrower who -- receives relief under this plan would have necessarily gone into default or delinquency without it.   That would -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, of course not, but, I mean, it does kind of factor into the consideration, particularly in a situation where you don't have notice-and-comment proceedings, that maybe, again, that's something that a broader representation of national interests in Congress would take into account, rather than what the -- the Secretary in a particular case, who's weighing a lot of options and considerations as well, would take into account. I mean, if more than half the people say they don't need this relief, extending relief to that breadth certainly raises questions. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " So let me be clear that I think there is an avenue to address those kinds of questions with overbreadth.   I don't think that it's a function of statutory interpretation, though.   That would be applications of the statute to particular fact patterns and whether the Secretary could justify the lines he drew and the level of relief he decided was necessary. And, here, Secretary -- Secretary Cardona explained that huge numbers of borrowers were going to go into default and delinquency, and it's not as though he could easily segregate and say here are the 50 percent where I know for sure it will happen and here are the 50 percent where it won't.   If -- if he could make that kind of determination, it might provide a basis to determine that he should have drawn different lines, but we don't have anything like that here. And I would just point again to the forbearance policy.   You know, that has applied across the board to every single student-loan borrower with a federally held loan for the past three years.   But I think that both Secretaries acted entirely within the domain of the HEROES Act in recognizing that that kind of broad class-wide relief was necessary due to the particular exigencies of this emergency. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you. Since we're dealing in -- in a -- in a case with individual borrowers or would-be borrowers, I -- I think it appropriate to consider some of the fairness arguments.   You know, you have two situations, both two kids come out of high school, they can't afford college, one takes a loan, and the other says, well, I'm going to, you know, try my hand at setting up a lawn care service, and he takes out a bank loan for that. At the end of four years, we know statistically that the person with the college degree is going to do significantly financially better over the course of life than the person without. And then along comes the government and tells that person: You don't have to pay your loan.   Nobody's telling the person who is trying to set up the lawn service business that he doesn't have to pay his loan.   He still does, even though his tax dollars are going to support the forgiveness of the loan for the -- the college graduate, who's now going to make a lot more than him over the course of his lifetime. Now it seems to me you may have views on fairness of that and they don't count.   I may have views on the fairness of that and mine don't count.   We like to usually leave situations of that sort, when you're talking about spending the government's money, which is the taxpayers' money, to the people in charge of the money, which is Congress. Now why isn't that a factor that should enter into our consideration under the major questions doctrine again, where we look at things a little more strictly than we might otherwise when we're talking about statutory grants of authority, to make sure that this is something that Congress would have contemplated? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " So my reaction to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that Congress did take those kinds of considerations into account in specifically providing this authority to the Secretary.   I think that the same kinds of arguments about fairness or -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, it's just circular.   You're -- you're -- you know, it sort of, you know, begs the question to say that for -- I don't see any evidence that they took -- the -- the -- the -- the person who is trying to start the lawn service because he can't afford college, I don't see any evidence that they took him into account. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " But, if that's what Congress would need to take into account and show, then it can't legislate, it can't provide the executive with preauthorization to take action into an emergency.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So, and yet, you're relying on -- on -- you're relying on an interpretation of the statutory authority to say that that's implementing Congress's intent to do that.

Prelogar", "text": " Well, let me break it apart into two different components because I think there's a first-order question of whether Congress could have foreseen the possibility of debt discharge at all.

That was a well-established form of relief that you can provide to borrowers in -- in hardship situations, as I previously mentioned, it's one of the core provisions in the -- Title IV, and Congress, in specifically enacting a statute that's aimed at this problem of not leaving borrowers worse off in reaction to a national emergency, clearly understood that using this broad language -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So we're just going -- "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Well, so that's the first-order question. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- I'm not -- I'm not faulting you for repeating your answer since I think I probably repeated my question, but you're just saying -- you know, it's the same argument about what \"modify and waive\" means. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " It is as a statutory matter on the categorical argument about debt discharge. Now you have asked me several questions about the scope of this program, and -- and let me try to be responsive to that.   I recognize that this is a big program, but that's in direct reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which itself was a really big problem.   There hasn't been a national emergency like this in the time that the HEROES Act has been on the books that's affected this many borrowers. And so I think it's not surprising to see in response to this once-in-a-century pandemic the kind of relief that the Secretaries have offered here, the forbearance policy that has itself cost $150 billion and now this loan forgiveness program. To the extent that you have concerns about the scope and size of the program, though, I would say that if I can get you to agree with me, and maybe I can't, on this point that the categorical debt discharge argument doesn't work as a statutory matter, then I think the right place to look to house those concerns is in arbitrary and capricious review. We think here that the Secretary drew reasonable lines in crafting the scope of relief, but if you disagree or if you think he should have taken different interests into account, that would be a basis to reverse him on arbitrary and capricious grounds, not to distort the plain meaning of the HEROES Act.

I take your response to that. But then you're thinking about contextually how it all works, it fits together, the fact that there will be winners and losers, big winners and big losers, relatively speaking, if the executive branch has this kind of authority, people who didn't go to college, as the Chief Justice said, or people who had just paid -- who had paid off their loans, who say what they did to pay off their loans and they're getting no relief because of the timing of the situation. And if Congress were doing this, Congress could and would, no doubt, try to -- would hear about all of that and factor all that in in a way that a Secretary could not, especially without notice-and-comment. Should any of that factor into how we think about whether to give a broad reading to \"waive\" or a narrower reading to \"waive,\" given the context? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " No, I don't think that that should factor into how to interpret the statute.   I think instead, as this Court usually does, it needs to consider that text on its own terms.   And I don't see any way to read the provision \"to waive or modify any Title IV provision\" to mean but only do it a little bit, only in response to minor emergencies. It would actually be perverse to suggest that when there's a big emergency that might necessitate broader relief, the Secretary's more disabled from acting. Instead, that's the language in the statute that's meant to empower the Secretary and to ensure that he has whatever tools are necessary to fulfill the statutory purpose, to ensure that borrowers are not left worse off. With respect to these concerns about whether there's room to take into account other interests beyond student-loan borrowers, you know, there are avenues to go to Congress for additional relief, to implement other programs. There's been unprecedented levels of COVID pandemic aid, as I mentioned, and I think to suggest that the Secretary here should have told borrowers who he had determined were at massive risk of default and delinquency in record numbers that he wasn't going to use the authority under the HEROES Act that's tailor-made to prevent that result would have been an -- an irresponsible thing to do. So, again, I think that this really comes down to Congress's judgment that there should be authority to provide the benefit within the context of this program.   Obviously, there are additional authorities and benefits that can be provided under other programs. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " A separate question.   The student loan issue is a major public policy issue without regard to COVID to begin with, obviously, and how to deal with that and the burdens it's imposing on people after they get out of college who have massive student loans to pay back, obviously, a huge public policy issue that was being considered before Should that factor into how we think about this? In other words, this is something that was on the table, being discussed, being debated, and then all of a sudden it's -- this public policy idea is attached that was being proposed and pursued before the pandemic is attached to pandemic legislation? Matter at all? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B.

If you put yourself back in the shoes of the 2003 Congress, it couldn't necessarily anticipate exactly what would be the subjects of political discussion and debate at the time that the COVID national emergency pandemic hit.   And so going down the road of suggesting the meaning of the statute could change or it should be interpreted in a -- in an atextual way because of current conditions, I think, would basically disable Congress from being able to take the kind of action we have here of trying to ensure that the executive can act quickly, with preauthorization, in an emergency, to forestall massive student-loan default.

So you agree, right, that we're not talking about a worse financial position generally; we're just talking about in relationship to the debt? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B.

Prelogar", "text": " -- if you are distressed financially, it might mean that you're having trouble paying your mortgage or paying your rent, buying your groceries, and paying your debt.   But, yes, the -- the function of the HEROES Act focuses on your position with respect to your ability to repay your student loans. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So it seems to me that that language \"in relation to that financial assistance\" suggests that the relationship would continue, but the waiver or modification here severed the relationship to the debt so that it no longer exists. So why would that be consistent? I mean, doesn't the statutory language \"in relation to that financial assistance\" presuppose an ongoing relationship that might be modified but not completely ended? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " No.   I think that that would be reading in limitations that can't be gleaned from the text.   What we understand the statute to be focusing on, and specifically looking at the subparagraph here that justified this Act, making sure that student-loan borrowers are not worse off with respect to their loans, that functions as a matter of their probability of being able to actually make their payments. And this actually relates to some of the questions that Justice Gorsuch was asking about better off, worse off.   You know, imagine a student-loan borrower, for example, who before the pandemic had her affairs entirely in order. She had a zero percent chance of defaulting on that debt.   But then COVID hit.   Her life has been disrupted.   Her job was disrupted. Inflation is at record levels.   She's having trouble making ends meet.   And now she has a much higher likelihood of -- of not being able to pay her student loans. In that situation, HEROES Act relief, if it were to operate even to completely eliminate her debt so she doesn't have an ongoing relationship with it, it would just restore her to her pre-pandemic relation insofar as her risk of default and -- and delinquency. She was zero percent before and now she'll be zero percent after.   And so it doesn't inherently make her better off within the meaning of the statute.

I guess I'm wondering whether or not the same fairness issue would arise with respect to any federal benefit program.   So I'm thinking about the fact that, as a result of COVID, we had massive infusions of money given to various companies, organizations, clearly authorized because Congress said do it. I'm wondering whether it -- that would be unfair to people who didn't own a company or somebody who didn't have, you know, a nonprofit and wasn't getting that money.   I just don't know how far we can go with this notion of, to the extent that the government is providing much-needed assistance to people in an emergency, it's going to be unfair to those who don't get the same benefit. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Yes, that's exactly right, and what I would say is that is inherently an aspect of what Congress authorized in the HEROES Act as well.   It specifically thought about this situation, what to do about student-loan borrowers who are impacted by a national emergency who might then end up in a worse position with respect to their ability to repay, and Congress made the judgment you can give them relief. And with any benefits program, there are going to be others outside the context of that particular program who aren't getting the benefit.

It does not, as this Court has already heard.   I'd like to focus here on three issues specific to this case. First, the HEROES Act is the Secretary's only excuse for not adopting the program through negotiated rulemaking and notice-and-comment.   If that Act does not apply, there is no dispute that the program is procedurally improper. Second, on standing, the government makes one argument, that if Respondents prevail, the Secretary won't provide debt forgiveness to them under the HEROES Act.   But that isn't the proper inquiry. Respondents need only show that there is some possibility that the relief they seek will prompt the Secretary to forgive their debts.   On that question, there is no debate. Debt forgiveness is a top priority of this Administration.   The parties agree that the Secretary can forgive debts under the Higher Education Act, and the Secretary has never denied that he may follow the proper procedures and forgive Respondents' debts after his current program is declared unlawful. Finally, on the merits, Congress did not authorize the Secretary to create a $400 billion debt forgiveness program behind closed doors with no public involvement.   The whole point of negotiated rulemaking and notice-and-comment is that the individuals most affected by student loan regulations, like the Respondents, must have a meaningful voice in the regulatory process. But, here, the Respondents were deprived of their procedural rights, and their finances suffered.   Brown got nothing, and Taylor received only $10,000, even though high-income individuals making more than five times as much got $20,000.   The law requires that the Secretary give Respondents an opportunity to be heard. The judgment below should be affirmed.

And that environmental organization had standing because there was some possibility that if they went through the proper process, that the Forest Service would change its mind and wouldn't approve the Burnt Ridge Project.

And, I -- I mean, I can imagine a world, if you think of a hypothetical, in which the Secretary believes that they -- that -- that the Department only has authority under the HEROES Act.   Here we are in the midst of a pandemic.   The intention of the Department is to provide this relief in the context of the emergency and that if we don't have an emergency and that if we're not in this circumstance and we don't see the HEROES Act there, then they would not move forward.

Is that -- I mean, I think your challenge is -- is to make that sufficiently particularized and non-speculative. I mean, the -- the problem with standing jurisprudence for something that looks for something concrete and particularized, it's also very academic, you know, a dollar of injury and you're in, hundreds of millions that they can't trace directly to the agency action and -- and you're not. So what is it that makes the interest of your client who has, what, a $17,000 loan? "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " How is that sufficiently concrete and particularized in the context of something that the government would address if it can't do what it's doing now? "}, {"speaker": "J.

She has student loan debt and it's not being repaid, and that -- those are concrete interests at stake. So this is not someone off the street who is upset that his or her taxes are going to go up.   That -- that -- there's no question that would be a -- that wouldn't be a -- that would be a generalized grievance.   But, here, if you look at the scope and the purpose of the program, it's to help student-loan borrowers. But instead of doing this through negotiated rulemaking and notice-and-comment, they -- they did -- they carved up the lines and they did it all in secret. I -- I'd point the Court to page 31 of the government's reply brief.   In that -- on that page, the -- the government said that it had extensive discussions with banks and ultimately decided not to forgive FFEL loans. That's the type of thing that should be happening on the public record. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Mr. Connolly, aren't you really fighting Congress on this one? The HEROES Act specifically says no notice-and-comment, no negotiated rulemaking. Specifically says there's going to be an emergency, so we're waiving those procedural requirements. So, you know, you might think that Congress made a wrong call there, but that's Congress's call. "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Because, when -- when Congress wrote the HEROES Act, the waivers and modifications have to actually be authorized by the Act.   You can't just label something a waiver or modification and skip through negotiated rulemaking and notice-and-comment. Right there, subsection (d), it says the negotiated rulemaking requirements shall not apply to the waivers and modifications authorized or required by the Act. It doesn't say anything that the Secretary labels a waiver or modification is authorized by or required by the Act. And so we recognize that -- that Congress did create an exception, but the waivers and modifications actually have to apply.   They have to actually be authorized by the HEROES Act.

It's that that is a consideration of other Americans in a comparable situation who will not get that sort of relief that maybe the Secretary should have taken into account.   And then, if we had notice-and-comment rulemaking, the -- that maybe -- that would be a consideration that would be -- come forth, or maybe if Congress were involved in this expenditure of $500 billion, that that might be something that they could consider. "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Right.   And -- and I would also point to negotiated rule -- the negotiated rulemaking statute.   This is a unique statute that Congress said specifically that it wanted all of the individuals who are affected by the Title IV loan process, student-loan borrowers, universities, everyone, it wants them to be involved in the process.   And it strengthened those requirements in 1998. And so the idea, I think, that right after doing that, really strengthening negotiated rulemaking, that Congress said, yeah, you can create a $400 billion program on your own in secret without any public involvement, it just doesn't -- it just doesn't seem possible.

They're -- none -- none of those cases focused on the statute at issue.   They looked at the action.   Lujan Footnote 7, the -- the dam example, an individual who is living next to a dam, when they approve that dam without going through the proper process, that individual has a procedural right to challenge that. When the agency approves the dam, they're approving it under the Federal Power Act.   When the individual is going to get relief, he's getting it under the Endangered Species Act.   And I think what that footnote shows and what that example shows is that the statute really doesn't matter, what they're acting under.   What matters is the agency action. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Well, let me ask you about the evidence.   What -- what evidence do you need, as the plaintiff coming in claiming standing, that the agency would have proceeded under this other statute? Because it's not a world in which, you know, they overlap so entirely that if we take one away, they're automatically in the world of -- "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- HEA.   They would have to actually elect to operate in that other world.   And so this goes back to my very first question to you, which was about don't we -- aren't you relying on the assumption that if the HEROES Act falls, this agency or this -- this Administration would pursue the same course of action under this other statute? "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Sure.   A few responses. First, if you look at the nature of the action, it is applying to 95 percent of all borrowers.   It's not remotely tailored -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Do you have -- "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " -- to the pandemic. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- evidence that they've said, even pursuant to this litigation, for example, that if the Supreme Court strikes this down, we're going to pursue the same relief under the HEA? I'm asking about the -- like what do -- "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Is it enough for you just to identify another path? Don't you have to at least have some evidence that the Administration is going to move in that direction? "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " So, yes.   So, again, I would point to the -- the nature of the rule, that it's broad-based.   It's not -- it's not tied to the pandemic. The second thing I would point to is that there's all sorts of evidence.   When -- during the -- during the campaign, they were talking about doing broad-based debt relief.   It wasn't related to the pandemic.   Senator Warren and others passed resolutions urging the Secretary to use the Higher Education Act to pass debt forgiveness.   Scholars have written about this -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And yet -- "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " -- legal -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- and yet the Secretary chose this path.   So I guess I'm just trying to say, do we have something from the Secretary saying that, you know, we're definitely doing this under all circumstances and we're -- we pick the HEA if the HEROES Act falls? "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " I think that would be a very high burden for us to meet. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Because, if you look, again, at Footnote 7 of Lujan, when it's talking about why procedural rights are special, what it's saying is that if -- if the burden is on the plaintiff to come back and say, you know, my comments are going to be amazing, they're going to do this, they're going to change their mind, procedural rights are going -- are going to be useless.   They can always come back and say -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " No, but that's -- "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " -- you know what, we would have done the same thing -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- change your mind within the context of a particular program. That's -- this is Justice Kagan's point. I mean, yes, redressability gets relaxed when we're in the world in which procedural rights would have otherwise existed and you don't have to as a plaintiff show that they would have made a different ultimate determination if they'd heard your comments. "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " We understand that. But what you're suggesting is that same principle of redressability applies to whether or not they would shift to an entirely different legal base of authority to pursue this program. And I've never seen that before. "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " And -- and -- and, again, I -- I think this exact -- this -- this program, they could have -- they could have cited Section 1082 of the HEA to go under it. They -- they believe they can do it. They've said it in their brief that they can do it.   The reason they -- I -- I -- my guess is the reason why they didn't do that is because they would have had to go under negotiated rulemaking and notice-and-comment. And if you look at the -- the -- the -- the breadth of this program, it's not about the -- it's not about helping people who are uniquely suffering from the pandemic.   It's helping 95 percent of all borrowers and -- except for -- except for the Respondents here. And so I think, when you look at the nature of the -- of the program at issue, plus the campaign statements, plus the fact that they've never gotten up here and -- and denied it, you put all that together, and I think we have a strong -- at a minimum, some possibility that they're going to get -- when this program is declared unlawful and they go back to the drawing board, I don't think they're going to fold up shop.   I think they're going to say, how about the HEA? "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What's your theory if any, and maybe I should be asking the other side this, but your theory for why they didn't want notice-and-comment? "}, {"speaker": "J.

Okay. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "J. Michael Connolly", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you very much. General Prelogar? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to begin with standing again. My friend was asked several times whether he has a case to support this novel theory of standing. He referred to Lujan and Summers.   Those cases don't support the theory he's advancing here. In every case where there has been an asserted procedural injury, the plaintiff was asking the -- the -- for the agency to reconsider its decision under the very statutory authority at issue. He's not been able to identify any precedent where, instead, a plaintiff is able to say, I acknowledge I can't get any relief under the particular agency action at issue.   Instead, I'm hoping for some kind of bank shot where, if I can hold up the agency in this one area, maybe they'll take a different action under a different statute that will down the road provide me some kind of benefit.   And that would be an extraordinary expansion of Article III injury in the context of procedural injuries in particular. He was asked whether he had a limiting principle and he suggested, well, you have to have a general interest or stake in the subject matter of the dispute.   But I don't see how that limits it at all. Go back to the cases he cited which involved environmental plaintiffs, and imagine a scenario where you have an environmental plaintiff who is interested in pollution, and the agency has decided to regulate water pollution. Now that plaintiff doesn't actually have a stake in water pollution, isn't harmed by it, but the plaintiff thinks that if it can hold up the agency from regulating water pollution, maybe the next priority or goal will be to go after air pollution. I think that if a plaintiff came to court and pressed that kind of claim, it would be clear that it is far too attenuated and can't possibly supply a basis to allow this universe of plaintiffs to newly assert these kinds of procedural injuries or substantive injuries with respect to agency decisions that have not been made. He said that they have a concrete interest in trying to have their debts forgiven. If that were their interest, there were several straightforward mechanisms to try to vindicate it here. They could have challenged this plan as being arbitrary and capricious on substantive grounds to say you should expand the plan to include us, or if for some reason they really wanted to have this under the Education Act, they could have gone to the Secretary and filed a petition for rulemaking and said give us relief under the Education Act. But, instead, their argument here is that the Secretary can't provide debt relief. That is a really anomalous way to try to vindicate an interest that they claim they have in loan forgiveness. I've been thinking of it effectively as this Rube Goldberg theory of standing where instead of taking the most direct route, you've set up this complicated route to try to get what you want, all in service of being able to smuggle in a substantive challenge to the HEROES Act for borrowers who are not hurt one bit by the Secretary's decision to grant relief under that Act. Finally, I want to respond to his suggestion that instead the Secretary should have proceeded under the Higher Education Act here. I would think that at the very least, if they were going to ask this Court to recognize a cognizable Article III injury on that basis, it would be incumbent on them to explain their wholly unexplained position of why they think the Secretary could do this under the Higher Education Act. My friend has suggested that that's what this program was actually designed to do. But this is a pandemic-related program.   It specifically focuses on the national emergency circumstances that have had profound financial effects on student-loan borrowers.   And the Secretary acted to try to mitigate those financial harms from COVID. That's what the HEROES Act was made for.   It is a perfect fit for this kind of circumstance, and it explains why the Secretary chose to provide this relief to those who were harmed by COVID, just as the forbearance policy was put into place right at the start of the pandemic similarly on those COVID concerns. And then, finally, I -- I know that we have had hours today on the legal issues in this case, but I do want to step back for a moment and focus on the stakes of this case for the tens of millions of student-loan borrowers in this country who have had devastating financial impacts based on this unprecedented pandemic. Over the past three years, they have benefited from the critical relief of the forbearance policy.   That's an unprecedented form of relief, but it was very much needed in this circumstance to ensure that we did not see a deluge of default and delinquency on student loan debt. And it's undisputed, my friends have not disputed that when that forbearance policy ends, and it can't continue indefinitely, once it ends, there are going to be millions of borrowers who are in a worse position because of COVID with respect to their ability to repay their loans. Ninety percent of the borrowers covered by this plan make less than $75,000 a year, and the Secretary documented the extreme impacts that COVID had had on their financial affairs. Already, 26 million people have applied for this relief, and 16 million people have been approved to receive it.   For those Americans, this is a critical lifeline to ensure that they are not subject to the severe negative consequences of delinquency and default on student loan debt. And the relief for these Americans has been held up by two student-loan borrowers who don't even have standing and whose claims fail on the merits.   So we'd urge you to reject their claims.
