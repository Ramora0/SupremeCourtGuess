[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 20-303, Vaello-Madero -- United States versus Vaello-Madero. Mr. Gannon. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals erred in holding that Congress's decision not to extend its Supplemental Security Income program to Puerto Rico lacks a rational basis. As this Court has recognized, Puerto Rico has a unique tax status vis-a-vis the federal government.   Puerto Rico's residents and employers contribute to federal unemployment insurance and to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and they receive benefits from those programs, but Congress has expressly exempted them from the obligations to pay many forms of federal taxes, including federal income tax in most instances, excise taxes, gift taxes, and estate taxes, which means that much of the revenue that would have flowed into the federal treasury can instead be tapped by territorial government, which therefore has greater leeway to make different fiscal or economic choices consistent with its distinctive status as a self-governing commonwealth. Congress could reasonably take those considerations into account when deciding that Puerto Rico's residents would receive some federal benefits but not others.   And this Court has already recognized as much when it concluded in Torres and Rosario that there is a rational basis for Congress to exclude Puerto Rico's residents from participation in a social welfare program. Of course, it would also be rational for Congress to make changes on either side of its balance between taxes and benefits.   And the president has already called on Congress to extend SSI benefits to the residents of Puerto Rico. But whether and how to alter the balances underlying current social welfare policies are decisions that are left to Congress and evaluated under a deferential rational basis standard that this Court should find has been satisfied here. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mr. Gannon, do you think that the Territory Clause is enough of a -- a source of authority for the government or Congress to have a rational basis to do what it's doing? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We aren't resting just on the Territory Clause here, Justice Thomas.   We agree that the equal protection principle in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause applies here, and there does need to be a rational basis. The fact that the Territory Clause gives Congress a different and unique source of authorities over territories does mean that it is inescapably the case that Congress often legislates differently with respect to a territory than it does with respect to the rest of the country and that -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, how much of your argument depends on that? I'm trying to sort of figure out whether or not just merely under the Territory Clause you could -- how much could you do? For example -- I'll give you a different approach -- could you do the same thing to Vermont? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " The question would still be governed by rational basis, and I -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I'm -- I guess would the test -- how different would the test be for Vermont versus Puerto Rico? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I don't think the rational basis test would be different.   I think the Court would still be looking under that deferential screen into whether there is a legitimate governmental interest that's being served by drawing a different line there. And there are federal laws that make state-by-state distinctions, but I do think that the Territory Clause means that it is natural that Congress has often legislated differently with respect to territories, and, therefore, there are -- it is going to be a more common break point in legislation. But, here, we think that the reason is deeper because it relates to the balance of federal benefits and burdens that apply in the territory differently than they do in the states. And so, if Vermont had a different relationship with the federal government on the one side, then it might be easier for the federal government to alter it on the other side.   And in this instance, it doesn't. Now Congress always takes into account, it is always legitimate for Congress to take into account, the source of federal funding associated with a particular program.   Sometimes that connection is obvious.   In the case of the Medicare and Social Security trust funds, that -- that's something where there's a one-to-one relationship.   For refundable tax credits, it -- it's usually somebody needs to be filing a federal tax -- income tax return in order to be eligible for a refundable tax credit, and the connection is sometimes more obvious like that. But, in this instance, we think that it is clear, as the Court recognized in Torres and Rosario, that Congress -- its relationship with the territory is different largely in this context of a social welfare benefit program because of the different burdens that the tax -- the federal tax structure imposes in Puerto Rico, and that means that there is a smaller tax bite being taken out of the Puerto Rico community by the federal government, which leaves Puerto Rico greater leeway than Vermont would have to deal with this problem in its own fashion.

Gannon", "text": " We don't think that they affect the analysis that the Court needs to apply here because we acknowledge that the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment is applicable here.   The Insular Cases were about whether there are different portions of the Constitution that apply differently to different territories. And, here, everybody has acknowledged this Court has previously held that the equal protection component of the -- of the Fifth Amendment applies to Puerto Rico.   And, therefore, we don't think that the Court needs to address the Insular Cases here any more than it did last year in Aurelius, where it noted that the Court has repeatedly declined to extend the Insular Cases.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " What is the government's position on the Insular Cases? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " The government's position on the Insular Cases is that some of the reasoning and rhetoric there is obviously anathema, has been for decades, if not from the outset, but that the -- that they are not at issue in this case because the conclusion that parts of the Constitution wouldn't apply to Puerto Rico doesn't decide anything that is relevant to this case. The equal protection component applies here, and -- and, therefore, just as in Aurelius, the Court doesn't need to say anything else about the Insular Cases in order to decide this case. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counselor, can I unpackage your argument? Let's start with Justice Thomas's question.

You -- it seems to be that what you're saying -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- cost alone is not enough.   Cost plus something else is. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Correct? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " That's correct.   We think that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So let's look at the plus of that.   This program is fully funded by the federal government, fully administered by the federal government.   There's no cost to Puerto Rico.   There's no cost to any state.   And so I don't understand what the different relationship with Puerto Rico has to do with this program because there's no cost to the government. It's not as if it could take this federal money, Puerto Rico, and distribute it in some other way or put this money to use in some other way because the money's going directly to the people, not to the government.   So I don't see how that can be a plus with respect to the self-governance of Puerto Rico. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " That -- that's true, Justice Sotomayor, with respect to the money that's coming back from the federal government to the recipients -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, it's not -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- of the program. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- coming back. Well, let's go back to that point, okay? As the courts below noted, most of the SSI recipients, if not all of them, don't pay taxes.   So it's not as if the recipients of this money are any different among themselves. Puerto Ricans are citizens, and the Constitution applies to them.   Their needy people are being treated different than the needy people in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands. So explain how those people, none of whom pay taxes to the federal government, how are they different? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " They are different -- first of all, there may be some taxes from which they are exempt, like the excise taxes, as we do point out, but the reason -- the primary reason why they are different is because they live in a community, in a locality where there is less tax money being taken by the federal government out of that community to be -- being taken into the general revenues at the federal level, which is then distributed through various federal benefit programs -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what do I do -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- and other ways, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- with the record that I see in the First Circuit case, Penya, that shows that Puerto Ricans pay, maybe not excise tax, maybe not income tax, but that they pay as much taxes, other combined taxes, as other states in the union, meaning it's nice to sort of cherry-pick one tax, but that's true around the country. The government gives some tax benefits to some things and not others.   You've got to look at the structure as a whole to see is there a really substantial difference.   But I'm looking at that record, and it shows Puerto Ricans as a community, and all the other taxes they pay, pay more than many states of the union. So I don't know how exempting out one or two taxes gets you away from seeing whether the government's distinction is rational based on the need of the citizens who are supposed to receive the money. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " And the -- it -- the tax bite that the federal government is taking from the entire community is lower.   And so, on a per capita basis, they're -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's not.   I mean, the Penya case showed it exceeds some other states. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E.

Gannon", "text": " But -- but -- but I -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now let me add one thing.   The thing I would add is there's not a word about Puerto Rico in this statute.   It has a definition of the United States, doesn't say anything about Puerto Rico. But there is a relevant sentence in the Federal Relations Act, I think, but you can tell me I'm wrong.   It said federal laws not locally inapplicable shall apply to Puerto Rico. Okay? Why is this law locally inapplicable when, even if your theory is right, it's never happened in the case of a state and there is good reason for applying it? There are a lot of SSI people who -- you know, in Puerto Rico.   And there is no real connection between the SSI beneficiaries and federal taxes, and they pay a lot of taxes. So what's your best argument, no, this is locally inapplicable? Why? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " It's locally inapplicable because the statutory definition makes it inapplicable.   It defines the program as being available in the United States. Congress then, as it routinely does with respect to different programs, has specified what that means in this particular context. And I don't think that you should draw any particular inference from the fact that the statutory definition that they used there has to do with the United States.   Sometimes, when Puerto Rico is included in a program, it's defined as being a state, and sometimes it's defined as not.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What I'm actually thinking is -- is -- I'm not thinking something simple, and I haven't got it quite worked out, but those words \"locally inapplicable\" and the Federal Relations Act were designed to put Puerto Rico in a status that isn't in practice quite that of a territory, although it's not a state.   It's a commonwealth. It's the Estado Libre Asociado, and no one knows exactly what that is.   And so shouldn't we, in fact, look at the purpose of the Federal Relations Act and say it takes a little bit more -- a little bit more in terms of a good reason to exclude Puerto Rico from a benefit than it would the Marianas and Guam and the other territories that have no such act? Or is it totally irrelevant? Did we tell the United Nations something that wasn't true? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We did not tell the United Nations something that wasn't true.   And we've said that we think that one of the reasons why this is justified is because it does, indeed, help promote territorial autonomy because it is related to the fact that, as Congress is taking fewer federal tax dollars from the Puerto Rico economy, it leaves greater leeway for the territorial government to have -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But the government -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- its own tax structure. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- is this the same government that is bankrupt and that is being run, the economy, by people, some of them anyway, not from Puerto Rico but from -- under a law that applies from the mainland to the mainland? And is this the same program that would, in fact, give the people on average who need it $418 a month, as opposed to what Puerto Rico can afford to give them, which is $58 a month? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " It -- it is the same program.   We think that the PROMESA statute, which was enacted about two months before the benefits that are actually at issue in this case, but we don't -- we don't think that that affects the analysis here -- PROMESA itself is a temporary bankruptcy measure that was intended to assist in restoring Puerto Rico's fiscal economy and its security.   It is itself intended to promote autonomy by restoring Puerto Rico's fiscal footing. And, therefore, as here, Congress is seeking to make locally applicable laws.   It has made the determination -- the federal relationship principle here is something that's been overridden by Congress's specific determination with respect to the applicability of this program. Nobody has ever thought that -- that Puerto Rico might have been implicitly included by virtue of the statute that you -- that you cite, Justice Breyer, and that's why this Court decided in the 1970s that -- that this particular exclusion was constitutional in Torres. And -- and so, in -- in this context, we think that Puerto Rico does have extra autonomy to deal with this problem precisely because the federal government has taken fewer tax dollars out of that local economy. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Gannon -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " How much has the federal government -- maybe there aren't statistics on this -- provided assistance and revenue to Puerto Rico? Do -- do you have any information on that? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I -- I don't have aggregate information about how much federal revenues have -- have gone to Puerto Rico, especially in recent years.   There are some figures in the SEIU amicus brief that -- that parse data from 2004 and 2010 about the net federal expenditures in different jurisdictions. And I think what they show is that Puerto Rico is not being treated as an extreme outlier.   They -- they show that if you take into account federal expenditures in a jurisdiction, subtract out federal taxes that were collected from that jurisdiction, so that's the net expenditures in -- in the jurisdiction, on a per capita basis, Puerto Rico is receiving less back from the federal government than the District and 17 states, but it's receiving more than 33 other states. And so it's not being treated here as an extreme outlier, but we think it is always appropriate for Congress to take into account this balance of payments consideration, especially against the backdrop of the fact that Puerto Rico, as a territory, does have its own government.   It does have -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Excuse me.   But you -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- greater wherewithal to -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's hard to imagine that Puerto Rico has the ability, given that it's in temporary bankruptcy, to do what you say to be able to raise taxes to help the needy. But what do I do with the fact that the findings, when Puerto Rico was given federal tax exemption, were based on the fact that Congress recognized that the Commonwealth's economy could not sustain further taxation? So Congress itself, when it exempted federal income tax, made a finding that there isn't the ability to do what you say. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " It -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There isn't -- you know, it's illusory to think that Puerto Rico's local economy could match the federal economy and give those tax resources to its needy. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " That -- that was the reason why there shouldn't be two separate tax bites out of the Puerto Rican economy.   And so that's why Congress -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, it said that it couldn't sustain -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " It -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- further taxation. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- it couldn't sustain the additional layer of federal taxation and, therefore, have the same reduced capacity to issue income taxes that states would have because they have to add on top of what the federal taxes would otherwise be. And this is why the income taxes in Puerto Rico that the territorial government raises are at -- generally at higher rates than states are able to raise, because they don't have to take after the federal government has already taken out of that population.   Of course, that's not true with respect to FICA. There are still some federal taxes that are being taken out, but they're -- they're getting full benefits back. And so, here, we think, in the aggregate, it's appropriate for Congress to take account of the fact that when there is less total share going into the federal -- federal treasury, that there is less of a total share coming back to the community. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Gannon -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Gannon -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- am I right that that theory would enable Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from any benefits program?

There's a case pending in the First Circuit that involves not just SSI but also SNAP and also the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D. We have not sought to distinguish those particular benefit programs. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, I'm wondering, on your theory, how any such distinction could be made.   It seems as though it's a theory that would apply equally well to any benefits program, so the -- if -- if -- if you are correct, the lesson going forward -- and maybe Congress does this and maybe it doesn't, and you might say it's up to them -- but the lesson going forward is Congress can do this whenever it wants. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We think that here, it -- it -- the rational basis standard that the Court articulated in Torres and applied in Rosario would allow Congress to take into account this consideration that -- that there is less tax revenue coming in.   There's also the cost of the program.   That's the other side of the coin. And we think here it is also promoting local autonomy because this is the type of program that, setting aside current -- the strained attitude of the current economy there, it is still true as a general matter that there is more autonomy in Puerto Rico to have more tax money available for designing different social benefit programs in a different way than the federal government would otherwise necessarily impose or allow -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Gannon, that -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- in that context. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " -- that answer that you're giving Justice Kagan, it -- it's similar to the one that you keep saying about Congress taking into account revenues coming in and then benefits going out. And I guess I was surprised.   When Justice Thomas asked you about how much the Territories Clause bore on this, you seemed to kind of back away a little bit from what you said in your brief. And I understand you're not resting entirely on the Territories Clause, but your answers seem to take account of the status of Puerto Rico as a territory, because, otherwise, I don't see why your argument doesn't lead exactly to what Justice Breyer said, which is, well, we're looking at it here and, you know, Mississippi is a poorer state, and so the revenues going into the federal treasury, you know, are really low compared to the others, and we'd be paying, you know, a lot out. I mean, I guess I had understood in your brief to say Mississippi would be distinguishable from Puerto Rico based on statehood.   Am I -- I just want to know based -- what your position is.   Am I misunderstanding your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well, I mean, I think there are two ways in which Mississippi is distinguishable.   One is that they don't have the differential treatment on the tax side. But, secondly, it is the case that the Territory Clause matters because it means that it is routine for Congress to draw some distinctions with respect to the territories. And the Constitution itself recognizes this as a legitimate dividing line. But, if we -- if we look back at other equal protection cases, we do think that the Court has acknowledged that Congress can distinguish even among the states.   A case like Hodel, the Surface Mining Act case, had differential effect in different states on the basis of geographic criteria that were defined there, and the Court said that that was just subject to rational basis review.

That's why Respondent was able to get these benefits while he was living in New York.   He's not able to get them while he's living in Puerto Rico. There's no evidence that anyone on the other side has cited that ties this determination in the 1970s about how Puerto Rico would be treated in this benefits program to any of the troubling statements in the Insular Cases from the early 20th Century that came from this Court.

And I'm just not quite sure -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well, we -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- why one would say that it's rational to treat a -- a group of people, of citizens, differently from other citizens on the mainland when the need is the same.

And there's nothing that ties the history of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity to this decision that happened in the 1970s.

I think it would indicate that it's not true to say that the residents of Puerto Rico are politically powerless if Congress were to pass a statute like that.

Okay. Is it always the case in the government's view that rational basis applies to distinctions based on territorial status?

"}, {"speaker": "Hermann Ferr\u00e9", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Not long ago, Americans with disabilities, especially the poor, were practically excluded from society.   The SSI program helped change that, replacing an uneven patchwork of programs with a uniform standard of national support, guaranteeing poor and disabled Americans the autonomy to buy their own food and clothing, move more freely, and live with dignity. But that guarantee is not enjoyed by all Americans.   Some are excluded because of where they live in the country.   My client, Mr. Vaello-Madero, an American citizen, qualified for SSI after suffering a debilitating illness while living in New York.   His benefits were then revoked solely because he moved to Puerto Rico. We're here today because the government have sued him to recover payments he received while living there, even though he remained disabled and unable to work. Congress's decision to exclude the poor and disabled in Puerto Rico is based on the false premise that they are outside the U.S. The Downes Court, the same Court that decided Plessy, deemed Puerto Rico foreign for domestic purposes because of the race and ancestry of its people. And as was made clear in Califano v. Gautier Torres, that premise from Downes continues to provide an excuse for Congress to deny equal treatment.   As such, the proper basis to examine the exclusion here is heightened scrutiny. But it is also simply irrational to treat Mr. Vaello-Madero differently just because he's now in Puerto Rico.   That is what the lower courts unanimously held.   For all relevant purposes, he is the same as similarly situated individuals in the states and the Northern Mariana Islands.   Tax status is irrelevant. Those poor enough to qualify for SSI pay no federal tax, and they don't have to to qualify. I welcome your questions.

I don't know about that one.   I haven't -- I haven't really thought through that. Second, if you don't lose on that, you lose on Rosario and -- and so forth, unless there's something different about this, all right? At that stage, I thought there are two different things.   One is your argument about the Insular Cases, and that's a big bite in this case, where it isn't fully argued and so forth, but the other ground was the Federal Relations Act, which was designed to create a special status for Puerto Rico. What I have not done is think that through.   And so the government correctly says: Well, no one's really argued that here.   If you think about it, it doesn't create that big a difference from the standard in Rosario.   Why should it? And they have a series of arguments. So there we are.   Now what do you say?

But, in addition, local conditions was just not the line that was drawn with respect to the program. So the program is entirely unrelated to local conditions.   It's also entirely unrelated to the balance of payments between local jurisdictions and the federal government. So that is just not the line that Congress drew when it put in place the SSI program.

The two senators per -- per state discriminates against people in larger states. Many of -- in some of those larger states have more minority population. The Electoral College gives you a slight, just a slight, but a slight advantage if you're in a smaller state.   Delaware and Rhode Island, your vote for president counts a little more than your vote if you live in -- in New York or California, for example. And Article IV is -- is similar.   I mean, it would take a constitutional amendment to change the first two that I mentioned, and, actually, the Constitution purports to change -- prohibit changes to the Senate, but we'll put that aside.   But, here, it leaves it up to Congress.   And Congress has the ability, the role to make changes over time, does not give that authority to this Court. So that's a really big-picture concern that I think is reflected then in the precedent about what is our role with respect to the Territory Clause in terms of structures in the Constitution that may seem anachronistic to some, and the other two I mentioned are things that also seem anachronistic to some.

The -- that changed with the Insular Cases and has created a system in which populations now are held in an indefinite state of territorial status.

So you're maintaining that there should be equal treatment across the board, whether you live in Mississippi or Puerto Rico.   And Justice Alito asked you if you maintain that benefits, burdens, et cetera, should be the same. So what are the implications of that position for, you know, policies like Puerto Ricans not paying federal income tax? If we accept your position, would that mean that the burdens that Mississippians bear, et cetera, also have to apply to Puerto Ricans? "}, {"speaker": "Hermann Ferr\u00e9", "text": " I think that the analysis would be the same; in other words, the Court would look at that exclusion with heightened scrutiny and determine whether there's a compelling interest for treating that jurisdiction differently, in the same way that Congress could decide to -- to treat certain regions of the U.S. differently for tax purposes in order to encourage development, for -- for instance. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But you see that's exactly why -- Justice Barrett's question was exactly why what came into my mind are these words \"not locally inapplicable,\" which is different.   But I don't know what to do -- you see, I don't know what to do with them once they're in my head. I mean, it's fairly easy to think of things you might say.   You might say Puerto Rico was designed in Law 600 to maintain a kind of independent status but not totally.   Now -- and, therefore, this isn't applicable locally given that purpose.   Or you might say that purpose wasn't the overarching purpose in this instance. So, while I often like to look at purposes, I'm at sea in this one, and I -- and I don't know how you do this thing comparing Mississippi and Puerto Rico and when it is and when it isn't. "}, {"speaker": "Hermann Ferr\u00e9", "text": " Well, I think Law 600 was intended to give a measure of autonomy to Puerto Rico, akin to the states, without actually extending the full participation available to states.   So, with respect to local self-rule, if you will, there was that autonomy. Now, obviously, Congress has seen fit to take some of that autonomy back, and it did so with the PROMESA Act.   So this illustrates that Congress certainly had or believes it continues to have that power to provide -- delegate its ability to provide needful rules and regulations respecting Puerto Rico, and it can also take some of that back. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I don't know how often Congress enacts a statute that explicitly distinguishes residents of one state from another state, but it certainly does enact laws that have the effect of strongly favoring residents of some states and strongly disfavoring residents of -- of other states. The one that's been controversial in recent years is the deductibility of state and local taxes.   That strongly disfavored my home state of New Jersey, strongly -- strongly favored it when they were deductible; strongly disfavored the president's home -- home state of Delaware, where there's no income tax. So what is the difference between that and -- and this? "}, {"speaker": "Hermann Ferr\u00e9", "text": " That -- that -- that change in the SALT deductions was enacted across the board.   So the fact that local conditions then -- you know, the -- the result of the uniform application across the board created differences in local conditions doesn't mean that that statute didn't provide equal treatment.

I feel a little more comfortable now saying that the guarantee clause, which guarantees the republican form of government, we've said it presents a political question.

If I could just make three points: First, the territories clause -- the Territory Clause does not have an except -- an -- an expiration date, and, if it did, the Court's analysis in cases like Aurelius would have been completely different.   But the fact that Puerto Rico and other current territories have uncertain future status vis--vis the United States is one thing that we think promotes the idea that Congress must necessarily take into account that, among other things, when it is deciding whether to deal differently with territories. So Puerto Rico may be on its way to statehood.   It may be on its way to independence.   It may be on its way to some other status. But those are -- that is relevant to Congress being able to continue to calibrate the degree of relationship between the federal and territorial polities and economies and FISCs. And so that's another reason why being able to promote local autonomy by having a smaller federal tax bite and, therefore, maybe a faller -- a smaller share in federal benefits is something that is appropriate for Congress to do in this context. Second, my friend on the other side has still not, I think, given any reason why there's a special justification for overruling Torres and Rosario.   We do think that those would be controlling here. Torres was about this particular benefit, and Rosario, I think, the fact that it involved a block grant program doesn't meaningfully distinguish it and it didn't suggest, since it was drawing from Torres, which was not a block grant program, but actually about this program, SSI, an individual benefit program, the Court didn't seem to think that that was a -- a -- a reason to draw a distinction, and -- and, as I mentioned before, neither did Justice Marshall's dissent. And so, finally, my friend has forcefully given reasons why SSI should be extended to residents of Puerto Rico because he thinks that would better promote one of the main purposes of the program.   And we don't have a quarrel about that. The only question is whether it could be rational for Congress to have taken into account other considerations and decided in this instance that there was a basis for drawing a different line with respect to Puerto Rico. And unless and until Congress alters Puerto Rico's distinct tax treatment, which Respondent and his amici have pointedly not said that it is required to do, we think there is a plausible, rational, and non-invidious basis for Puerto Rico's residents to be excluded from SSI. We urge the Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
