[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 19-963, Henry Schein versus Archer and White Sales. Mr. Shanmugam. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents an important question concerning the interpretation of agreements that delegate questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. In its decision on remand, the court of appeals recognized that the arbitration agreements here contained a valid delegation, but it held that because the agreements also contained a carveout provision, they divided up responsibility for arbitrability between the arbitrator and the court. The court of appeals proceeded to decide the arbitrability question for itself, thus effectively negating the delegation altogether.   That reasoning cannot possibly be correct, and Respondent does not seriously defend it. This Court should once again vacate the court of appeals' judgment.   To do so, the Court need only apply two settled principles. First, a delegation is simply an antecedent agreement that is subject to the rules governing arbitration agreements more generally.   Second, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitration agreements are resolved in favor of arbitration. And under that presumption, a carveout provision that does not speak to who should decide questions of arbitrability cannot restrict the parties' delegation of those questions to the arbitrator. Respondent primarily focuses not on the question presented but on another question, whether the incorporation of arbitration rules that authorize the arbitrator to resolve questions of arbitrability constitutes a valid delegation. But the Court correctly declined to add that question at the certiorari stage because 12 circuits have held without conflict that the incorporation of arbitration rules is sufficient.   That holding is plainly correct, and overturning those decisions without the benefit of full briefing on both sides would work an avulsive change in the law. The Court should stick to the question it agreed to decide, and it should decide that question in Petitioner's favor.   The judgment of the court of appeals should be vacated. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. When you look at the pertinent clause at issue here, one thing that's clear is that they did not want actions seeking injunctive relief to be arbitrated.   They -- they say that expressly right at the outset.   As soon as they say any dispute, they have the carveout right there.   So they didn't want arbitrators dealing with actions seeking injunctive relief. Now, if that's the case and it was important enough for -- for them to spell it out right at the outset, wouldn't the last thing you'd think they would want is for an arbitrator to decide which disputes qualify? I mean, that would seem to follow a fortiori.   They don't want arbitrators deciding this.   Why would they want arbitrators to decide who gets to decide it? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with you that the carveout provision plainly carves out actions seeking injunctive relief from the scope of the arbitration agreement. But the question we're talking about this morning is a different one.   It's whether they intended to carve out disputes about who decides whether something falls within the carveout -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, no, that was my precise question.   If they don't want arbitrators around injunctive actions, why would they want arbitrators to decide who gets to decide that? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, I think that that's because it is highly unlikely that parties would ever want to divide up responsibility for arbitrability. After all, the whole point of a delegation is to resolve the who decides question.   It's to streamline the process by having the arbitrator decide the scope of the arbitration agreement. And I think that the court of appeals' opinion in this case well illustrates the problem here because the court of appeals, having said that the plain language of the agreement divided up responsibility for arbitrability, proceeded itself to resolve that very arbitrability question. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but they divided up -- they divided up the universe of actions here between some that will be arbitrated and some that won't be.   And I don't know why you'd have such a presumption against doing the same with respect to arbitrability. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Because arbitrability is different, Mr. Chief Justice.   It's the question of who decides.   And where you have a dispute, it would be very strange to say that the question of who decides is itself divided because somebody would have to resolve that doubly antecedent question. And I would be content to argue that our reading is the better reading of the agreement as a matter of common sense, but our submission here is simple.   It's that the presumption of arbitrability should apply, and the court of appeals erred by failing to apply it here as a matter of federal law. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Shanmugam, the -- it sounds as though you think this is -- that the delegation of arbitrability is -- is all or nothing.   How would you draft this provision so that it can divide the ability to -- the authority to arbitrate? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Justice Thomas, we don't think it's all or nothing, though, again, we think it is highly unlikely that the parties would want to divide up responsibility. But suppose that you had a provision much like the provision at page 27 of Respondent's brief that said something along the lines of except for an action seeking injunctive relief, the arbitrator shall decide whether the parties' dispute is subject to arbitration. There, the carveout clearly and unambiguously would operate on the question of arbitrability.   But we'd still be left with the problem that I was just discussing with the Chief Justice.   In that circumstance, someone would still have to decide whether the action is, in fact, an action seeking injunctive relief.   Someone would have to decide where there is a dispute over whether the arbitrator or the court should decide arbitrability. And, again, the court of appeals' decision well illustrates the problem because, having held that the parties divided up responsibility, the court of appeals proceeded to decide the question of who decides for itself and thus effectively negated the delegation altogether. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Could you just give me -- help me with the delegation language in this contract, this arbitration agreement. Where is it? I don't see the word \"delegation\" at all or a verb \"delegate\" at all. Would you walk me through that? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Sure.   And, Justice Thomas, this goes to the question that Respondent is seeking to insert into the case, but I'm happy to address the merits of it directly. The question is whether the incorporation of arbitration rules that authorize the arbitrator to resolve questions of arbitrability constitutes a valid delegation. Here, the incorporation is the reference to the arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.   That's quite common in agreements between sophisticated commercial parties like the parties here.   And among the relevant rules is Rule 7A, which authorizes the arbitrator to make that determination. And this Court has never required magic words on the face of the agreement. Instead, all that the Court has said is that you have to have clear and unmistakable evidence. And under ordinary objective principles of contract formation, the incorporation of a document suffices in order to render that document part of the contract. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " The experience of arbitration in the labor area for this question, I assume that George Burton's brief makes a big argument about the AAA, and -- but I won't accept that for purposes of this question. Assume there is clear and unmistakable evidence of delegating the arbitration matter to the arbitrator in general, okay? You've got the assumption? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now I also think that First Options rests heavily and basically repeats AT&T, so I've read AT&T about five times.   What it seems to say is, if you have a question, parties, or one of them, whether this dispute falls under the terms of the contract that have arbitration for 1 -- paragraphs 1 through 7 or is rather a Section 10 dispute, where there is no arbitration clearly, you don't know if it's a Section 8 or a Section 10, well, what happens? What AT&T says is, but that is a question of arbitrability.   It is a question whether this dispute is arbitrable.   So it's for the judge. But where there is an arbitration clause in the contract, as there was in First Options as far as the owners knew, but where there is a -- where there is an arbitration clause, then there is a presumption of arbitrability.   All right? So that seems to me, Judge, you decide.   You decide whether this particular dispute is sent to an arbitrator or -- or for the court, i.e., is it arbitrable, you decide, Judge, but if there's an arbitration clause in the contract, you decide with the presumption of arbitrability that it will normally be arbitrable.   That's what it seems to say. And so the judge was right to decide it below, but he didn't decide it right because he should have given it a presumption of arbitrability. Now that's how I read those two cases, but also in the back of my mind is what in heaven's name happens in labor arbitration.   In the ordinary labor arbitration case -- and that's where all this law comes from -- where -- one party, the labor union, says this is a Section 8 agreement, arbitrate it.   No, says the employer.   It is a Section 10 kind of situation grievance and, therefore, it falls within the exception, don't arbitrate it. How do they decide that? The scope -- you see, that's like the scope of the -- of the arbitration clause in the -- in -- in the agreement.   Do -- do you see what -- did you follow that? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I -- I did, Justice Breyer, and let me attempt to answer it very briefly, and I'll make two points. The first is that the First Options rule, with which I know you are well familiar, does come from the labor context, but I think it operates in the same way.   And I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " -- it's easiest to understand this conceptually if you think about the delegation as a kind of miniature contract formation, in other words, was there a meeting of the minds that the arbitrator should decide questions concerning the scope of the arbitration agreement, and that's precisely why we think an incorporation is sufficient because, under ordinary principles of contract formation, that is enough. And then, once you have that clear evidence, the presumption flips to the normal presumption because you treat the delegation like an arbitration agreement, and you apply the presumption of arbitrability. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Absolutely. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But who does that, the judge or the arbitrator? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " If there's a delegation, it's for the arbitrator to make the determination -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Where have you got any -- "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " -- per the agreement. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- where have you got the precedent for that? Because, when I read the five paragraphs in -- on -- in AT&T, it seemed to say, yes, that's the rule you apply, but the judge should apply it because it's a question of arbitrability. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Then, of course -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Very brief -- briefly, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " If you don't have a delegation, then, of course, it's a question for the court to decide. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Oh, what do you understand to be the basis for the presumption of arbitrability? It was recognized, I think, the first time in Moses Cohen, and the Court said that it was based on the federal policy favoring arbitration, and it cited Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act. But the Federal Arbitration, Section 2, we have also said, requires equal treatment of arbitration contracts and other contracts. So what -- what is the basis for saying that there is this federal policy that produces the presumption that you rely on? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " It's a good question, Justice Alito, and I'm not sure that the Court has ever spoken to it, so let me offer a potential explanation. As you rightly point out, this Court has repeatedly said that Section 2 of the Arbitration Act, along with other sections, establishes the principle that arbitration agreements should be enforced according to their terms. But I think this Court has also recognized the presumption in favor of arbitration as flowing from the policy underlying the Arbitration Act as a whole. And that presumption, in turn, to pick up where Justice Breyer left off, seems to come from the labor context, where, of course, under federal law, you have the -- the Labor Arbitration Act, and you have in that Act, in the NLRA, a -- a -- a recognition that federal courts can recognize federal common law. So I think, if I were pressed, I would say it's probably ultimately a matter of federal common law, but it also appears to flow from the terms in the -- and -- and the structure of the statutes themselves. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   And very, very quickly, I have basically the same question as the Chief Justice.   This case comes to us in a rather artificial posture, so we're required to assume that the contract incorporates -- that the contract provides for the arbitration of the who decides question across the board. And, of course, if that's true, then the answer to the question that we're supposed to decide is foreordained, but if we put -- but isn't that artificial? When you have a carveout and the parties have taken pains to say this subject, we don't want the arbitrator to have anything to do with this subject, we want the judge to decide this because the judge -- we want -- this is something that needs to be decided in accordance with the law, and we know that arbitrators have a lot more leeway in interpreting -- in interpreting contracts. Isn't that relevant to the question of the scope of the -- of the delegation of the -- the power to decide who decides? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " That is the very question before the Court.   And, very briefly, Justice Alito, our interpretation makes complete sense because, under our interpretation, the carveout operates as only a carveout from the scope of the arbitration agreement.   It gives the Court the power to enter preliminary injunctive relief pending an arbitration. But the question of who decides is a discrete one, and it wouldn't make any sense for the parties to carve out from that, absent a clear indication to that effect. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, you make much of the fact that we didn't grant cert on the cross-petition.   But, in your opposition to the cross-petition and even in your reply on the merits, you say we can reach the issue. In fact, you admitted in your cross-petition that we could affirm on alternative grounds and that it was incorporated and you encouraged us not to grant it. So I don't understand how you can tell us that we have to assume there was a clear delegation of both the exception and all other disputes.   So sort of educate me as to, having said we could, why you're saying we can't now. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, you, of course, could decide the incorporation question, and I don't think we've ever disputed that. Our submission today, as in our earlier brief, is simply that the Court shouldn't.   And, very briefly, to go back to what we said at the cert stage, we said that a cross-petition was unnecessary, but then we proceeded to devote, I believe, six pages of our opposition to the cross-petition in explaining why the Court shouldn't add the incorporation question to our cert petition -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right. Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " -- namely, because there was not a circuit conflict. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   May I just ask a question? First Option makes it very clear that we have to have a clear delegation. But I think what the court below said was what is unclear is whether the form of the delegation here was intended to be included in that arbitrability section.   There's a very limited holding saying where a party says I will -- I will arbitrate all disputes except a particular one, the issue is whether a particular one was delegated to the arbitrator in the following arbitration agreement. It seems pretty logical, not a -- a -- not an argument that the court below adopted. It doesn't seem to be irrational or even nonsensical.   It seems -- it seems fairly natural to me. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Justice Sotomayor -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So, if I believe -- if I believe there's ambiguity in what was intended to be delegated or not, how do I rule in your favor?

The court of appeals did think that the scope of the delegation was unclear.

Shanmugam", "text": " The answer is -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So let's assume that -- the following: Let's assume a provision that says except for actions seeking injunctive relief, we, the parties, agree that we'll, number one, arbitrate any dispute arising under this agreement and, number two, that the arbitrator will decide all questions of arbitrability. Now wouldn't it be clear on its face of that that the parties had given questions of arbitrability to the courts in actions seeking injunctive relief? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I -- I think that that's a closer question because of the way that you've modified the provision, because -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I don't think I've modified the provision at all.   I mean, I basically turned the reference to the AAA rules into a delegation, which is what you want me to do.   And then I suggested that the reading of this provision -- that the \"except\" clause applies both to the agreement to arbitrate disputes and to the delegation. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I -- I think you've made a subtle but important change because, in this provision, the relevant incorporation is introduced by \"in accordance with.\" And in our view, the carveout really operates only on what is subject to arbitration. Now, even if -- though you disagree with me on that, I think I would be left with my point that it is unlikely and it's even my view absurd to think that the parties would define a carveout that is coterminous both with regard to what is subject to arbitration and with regard to what is subject to the delegation.   And I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Mr. Shanmugam, I think it's not absurd for exactly the reason that the Chief Justice said, that once you decide that certain questions should be in the court, here, you know, suits involving -- that certain suits should be in the court, here suits seeking injunctive relief, you're not going to want to go to the arbitrator to decide whether suits plausibly seeking injunctive relief are, in fact, that.   You would just want to keep this in the courts generally. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So there's nothing unnatural or logically flawed to say, look, if you have something which at least arguably seeks injunctive relief, the court should deal with the question of whether it does and then should go on to decide the issue. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Justice Kagan, you could say the same thing regardless of whether an arbitration agreement contains a carveout. And so suppose you had this very provision without the carveout.   Any dispute arising under this agreement should be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the AAA rules.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Shanmugam, I'd like to return to the line of questions Justice Alito was pursuing, and that is the -- the presumption in favor of arbitration and the exception for clear and unmistakable delegations of arbitrability. These presumptions that we've recognized in our case law you indicated had both a statutory and a common law basis.   I'm -- I -- I -- I want to understand your statutory argument better because, for the moment, assume I'm -- I'm going to put the common law ones aside. You pointed us to Section 2, but Section 2 seems to suggest we follow normal contract rules in trying to discern the parties' intentions.   What am I missing? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I don't think you're missing anything, Justice Gorsuch, because I really do think that the Court has never spoken to this. But I think, quite frankly, that the origins of what we refer to as the First Options presumption, but it really originates in the Court's labor cases, are -- are -- are, frankly, somewhat more nebulous.   If you trace that back, it really traces back to a footnote in one of the Steelworkers cases that, in turn, relies on a law review article written by Dean Cox. Now there's no better person to have write a law review article than Dean Cox, but, ultimately, I think that that presumption just rests on a -- an empirical presumption that parties often don't focus on arbitrability. I think, by contrast, the presumption in favor of arbitration is a venerable one often reaffirmed and applied by this Court, and it's one that applies across the board.   And, again, it simply reflects the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I -- I -- I -- I'm still waiting for a statutory argument, though. I get that there are venerable law review articles and -- and lots of statements in our cases, but is there indeed any statutory basis for any of these? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I think I can't do really much better than Section 2.   And as I acknowledged earlier, I think that there is, you know, some tension between the principle that applies according to its terms and the presumption in favor of arbitration. My point, Justice Gorsuch, is simply that all that the Court needs to do in this case is to apply the presumption in favor of arbitration to the delegation to rule in our favor.   And what the Court shouldn't do is what Respondent suggests, which is to extend the First Options presumption beyond the context of whether or not there is a delegation to the scope of the delegation. The latter is a question of contract interpretation, and it should be governed by whatever the general rules are that govern the interpretation of arbitration agreements.

Good morning, Mr. Shanmugam.   I just want to make sure I have the roadmap clear here with you.   The premise of the case as you're presenting it to us is that this contract language expressly delegates the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Right.   Yes, that's right.   Or by incorporation, to be sure, but that's right. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yeah, by incorporation.

"}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.   And then your point is that the Fifth Circuit -- I think this is your argument -- confused the question of -- of arbitrability, namely, what subjects are decided by an arbitrator and what subjects are decided by a court -- confused that question with the question of who decides arbitrability, is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Yes, also correct. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.   And then, in the real world -- I want to pick up on some of Justice Kagan's questions -- kind of real-world, how people draft these contracts, what they expect, my understanding was that the question of who decides arbitrability, the who decides question, is almost never divided between a court and an arbitrator because that would be almost nonsensical in the real world because you need one person to decide, and it's either going to be the court or the arbitrator, not both the court and the arbitrator. Is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " That's correct.   And I'm aware of no examples of such a division. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Right.   Nor am I. Okay.   And then, in considering the effect of a carveout, I guess that would apply, as -- as I understand it, to every arbitration contract or virtually every arbitration contract because every arbitration contract specifies either limits or has carveouts. And so, if that alone means the Court decides what is arbitrable, then the Court will always decide arbitrability and really eradicate the idea that arbitrators can ever decide arbitrability.   Is that accurate, or am I missing something? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Yes, that's correct. And that gets to the point that I made in response to Justice Kagan. If you take a look at page 119 of the Joint Appendix, you'll see the AAA's model arbitration clause, and that provision is very similar to the provision at issue here except that it lacks the \"except for\" language.

Let's say that we're not going to address the question on which we denied cert, which is, you know, whether reference to the AAA rules suffices to be that clear and unmistakable arbitrability -- delegation of arbitrability. Here, as you point out, this carveout, you -- you say that it would be nonsensical -- even though parties can do it because they can contract and agree to what they want to, that it would be nonsense -- nonsensical to carve up arbitrability questions. If that's true, why isn't that reason to interpret this clause as not being a clear and unmistakable delegation of all questions of arbitrability? I mean, is just the invocation of the AAA rules enough given the inclusion of what you say would be a pretty odd -- pretty odd language? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Justice Barrett, I -- I -- I think the problem with that argument is that the agreement incorporates by its terms all of the AAA rules, not just some of them, as Respondent suggests.   And so the carveout would, at most, limit the substantive scope of any delegation. And I -- I -- I -- I want to make one further point about the relationship between these two questions because I think a number of the questions this morning have touched on this. Even Respondent concedes that the incorporation question is discrete from the carveout question.   Indeed, in an earlier filing in response to our stay motion, Respondent said that the Court need not reach the incorporation question in order to resolve the carveout question. So I do think that it is appropriate for the Court to assume, as 12 circuits without conflict have held, that -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But let me interrupt you just for one second, Mr. Shanmugam.

As a matter of contract formation, there is an agreement to arbitrate arbitrability.   At that point, Justice Barrett, everything else that we're talking about is a question of interpretation.   It's a question of the scope of the delegation.

This is an unusual case because Respondent makes no real effort to defend the reasoning of the court of appeals in the decision below. Instead, Respondent is really asking the Court to decide this case based on a different question, the incorporation question. And that would be a bold strategy in any case, but I would submit it's a particularly bold strategy here because Respondent asked the Court to decide that question at the cert stage, and the Court seemingly consciously made the decision not to add it. Now that question in our view doesn't warrant the Court's review and it doesn't warrant the Court addressing it here in light of the overwhelming consensus of the lower courts on that question. But, if the Court were to reach that question anyway and to reject the consensus view, it would have dramatic consequences for innumerable commercial contracts that are worded much like the contracts here. All that the Court need do in this case is to hold that the court of appeals' actual reasoning is inconsistent with this Court's decisions applying familiar Federal Arbitration Act principles, and for that reason, the court of appeals' judgment should be vacated.

Geyser", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The arbitration clause here does not delegate any gateway questions to the arbitrator, and even if it did, the parties' contract clearly exempts this dispute from the scope of any delegation.   Petitioner's contrary contention is incompatible with the FAA, this Court's authority, the agreement's plain language, and simple common sense. We submit that the Court should affirm for two independent reasons.   First, the mere incorporation of the AAA rules is not clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability. This Court applies an interpretive rule based on reasonable assumptions about the parties' likely intent and presumed expectations.   Yet the arbitration clause here is silent on delegation.   It does not utter one syllable about it. Anyone actually aware of this arcane issue would address the subject expressly on the face of the agreement.   And that is especially so against the backdrop of this Court's heightened standard and how easy it is to address the question directly. It is simply not plausible that anyone would recognize this issue and choose to resolve it by relying on an oblique reference to the AAA rules rather than a simple, explicit sentence delegating the gateway issue. Second, even if there is a delegation clause, it does not reach this dispute. Petitioner says the delegation is hidden in the AAA rules, but those rules do not even apply unless the action falls within the category of disputes subject to arbitration. If an action falls within the carveout, then it is not subject to arbitration and it is not subject to arbitration under the AAA rules. It makes no difference what those rules say because the condition for activating them is unmet.   Once the contract is read to mean what it so plainly says, all the confusion disappears.   It provides for arbitration generally, it exempts certain types of actions from arbitration, and it requires that any arbitration be conducted under the AAA rules. The only reason Petitioner finds this simple language bizarre, confusing, or circular is because Petitioner is trying to smuggle in a delegation clause where it so plainly does not exist.

You would reproduce it with the introductory phrase that says the following paragraph shall not apply in actions seeking injunctive relief.

If I'm required to assume only that part of it was delegated to the arbitrator, then maybe, under First Options, the answer is -- is also clear.

You're assuming a counterfactual for what half of it means. My friend is now saying you should, you know, construe any ambiguity in this sentence in a way that's profoundly atextual in order to accommodate this fictional delegation.

When the matter deals with arbitrability, we actually presume that the Court is supposed to decide those gateway questions. So, for whatever reason, we have those presumptions.   The Court has said many times that we have those presumptions. Then, as I understand what the Petitioner is saying, he's saying, now let's add a third presumption.   The third presumption is, if we see evidence of any delegation, then we should assume that the parties meant to delegate all arbitrability questions. So, if there's any delegation of arbitrability, there's complete delegation of arbitrability.   That's the presumption.

It provides a critical judicial safeguard, and it avoids a situation where the arbitrator is deciding the scope of his or her own jurisdiction. And there's every reason to assume that parties, again, under the Federal Arbitration Act, can delegate certain issues but not others to the arbitrator. And knowing that the -- the strong default is in favor of courts making those determinations, it does not make sense to say that, once there is any inkling that the parties wanted something delegated, that everything is delegated.

But it's really an elephant in an elephant hole.   When you look at the AAA rules, Rule 7(a) says, \"the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\" That's very broad language, which is probably why every court of appeals to address this said that the AAA rules are an express delegation.

Here's -- here's the problem I think I have with your argument, and you've made it very cleverly and persuasively, but the problem is that you are suggesting that the way parties divide up arbitration -- namely, some subjects will be subject to arbitration and decided by an arbitrator and some subjects won't -- also applies to the question of who decides arbitrability. So courts will decide whether certain things are arbitrable or not, and arbitrators will decide whether other things are arbitrable. I think that's what you're saying.

Geyser", "text": " I -- I don't think so, Your Honor.   I just want to be very careful in how I answer this. We -- we do lose in the sense of if you're presuming that referencing the AAA rules means that there -- there is some form of delegation to the arbitrator, but we don't lose in the sense that there are still limits on the scope of that delegation. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Okay.   I -- I didn't mean -- so you're referring to your second way, second route to victory, right? I -- I'm -- I'm just asking on the first point, do you lose on your argument that there was no clear and unmistakable delegation at all if we, declining to get into the question that we denied cert on, assume that incorporating the AAA rules by reference is enough to constitute a clear and unmistakable delegation, do you lose on your first argument if that's how we approach it? "}, {"speaker": "Daniel L. Geyser", "text": " I -- I think -- I think we likely do.   I mean, there are multiple layers of that argument, but I -- but I think, in the interest of time, we likely do. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So it's not your position that it's possible to incorporate the AAA rules by reference but still, through the context of the language in the provision, not intend simply by reference -- by incorporating the AAA rules to clearly and unmistakably delegate?

Geyser", "text": " No, no, no, Your Honor, and I'm sorry, I misunderstood then the -- the as to what -- what you were asking me to concede. Part of our reason that we don't think that this language is clear and unmistakable is precisely because it is ambiguous whether the parties included that language because they just wanted to set the -- the procedures for the arbitration or whether they were actually trying to address and focus on the concept of delegation in this, you know, subpart of a single rule out of 58 rules that happens to have anything that remotely resembles delegation. So I do think that you can say, in theory, Rule 7(a) -- again, we disagree with this, but it's a delegation provision despite not having exclusive language and precluding the court from addressing it, and you can still say that just as parties adopt the same linguistic formulation when they want to delegate or not delegate or before Rule 7(a) even existed, the bare use of this, you know, boilerplate is not enough to show that the parties had any intention whatsoever to delegate.

The -- I think the ultimate problem -- and I realize what -- what the Court is struggling with, and we're -- we apologize for trying to get the Court back into an issue that maybe it doesn't wish to address. But I think it is very difficult to construe this language, especially against a presumption that the reason you should not simply read the contract language on its face is to avoid, you know, a potentially circular result that the parties actually wanted an arbitrator to decide arbitrability, and so it doesn't make sense to say then the Court would have to construe the carveout. Again, that -- that is just asking for a profoundly atextual construction of the plain text of this agreement in order to embrace a counterfactual about whether a delegation actually exists.   And I think it would be very difficult to construe this language in a sensible way without getting into the delegation. But, again, if the Court does -- does wish to try that anyway, we still do think that that carveout is clear and unmistakable in saying that only some disputes are subject to the AAA rules, and if this is not one of those disputes, then it is not subject to the AAA rules, and it's not subject to any delegation, and it's ultimately up to the Court in its traditional gatekeeping role to construe that language and say what it means.

Respondent's entire argument this afternoon keeps coming back to the premise that there is not a clear and unmistakable delegation by virtue of the incorporation of the AAA rules. But Respondent has conceded that the Court can decide this case on the premise that the incorporation is sufficient.   The Court can and therefore should assume that the parties agree to delegate at least some questions concerning whether a dispute is subject to arbitration to the arbitrator. Now Respondent contends that a court should decide the scope of the delegation agreement.   And, Justice Breyer, of course, we agree with that.   Our submission is simply that when a court is making that determination, the presumption of arbitrability should apply. And if it is ambiguous that a carveout applies to the delegation, a court should hold that it does not, especially given how unlikely it is that the parties would divide up responsibility in that fashion. The purpose of delegation provisions is to assign clear responsibility where there is a dispute about the scope of an arbitration agreement.   Now that dispute can be a dispute about an express carveout, so, as here, whether the action at issue constitutes an action seeking injunctive relief, or not, so, as in my hypothetical from earlier, whether a dispute simply arises under the parties' agreement. It would effectively defeat a delegation to accept Respondent's view because someone would have to decide when there is a dispute about whether the arbitrator or the court should decide arbitrability. And it's one thing to say that parties may want to divide up responsibility for different types of questions of arbitrability, such as who is subject to the arbitration agreement or whether a class action waiver is valid, but, as I pointed out in my earlier colloquy with Justice Kavanaugh, we are not aware of any actual agreement in the real world that divides up responsibility for a particular question of arbitrability and in particular the paramount question of the scope of the arbitration agreement. Justice Kagan, we are decidedly not asking the Court to recognize a third presumption here.   Instead, our point is simply that once the First Options presumption has been satisfied, because there is clear and unmistakable evidence of a delegation, it falls out of the equation and the ordinary presumption in favor of arbitrability applies. And that is because, in the words of this Court's decision in Rent-A-Center, \"an agreement to arbitrate a gateway issue is simply an additional antecedent agreement,\" and the FAA operates on that additional arbitration agreement just as it does in any other. In closing, all we're asking the Court to do today is what the Court ordinarily does, to resolve a circuit conflict on the question presented and to correct a legal error on the part of the court of appeals. Having held that there was a valid delegation, the court of appeals failed to apply the presumption of arbitrability to the delegation agreement.   This Court's decisions make clear that the presumption applies, and that is all that the Court need say in a brief and narrow opinion applying settled law in order to vacate the court of appeals' judgment.
