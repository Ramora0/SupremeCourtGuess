[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 21-1086, Merrill versus Milligan, and the consolidated case. Mr. LaCour. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Alabama conducted its 2021 redistricting in a lawful, race-neutral manner. The state largely retained its existing districts and made changes needed to equalize population.   But that wasn't good enough for the plaintiffs.   They argue that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires Alabama to replace its map with a racially gerrymandered plan maximizing the number of majority-minority districts. But Section 2 requires an electoral process equally open to all, not one that guarantees maximum political success for some over others.   Section 2 does not and cannot obligate Alabama to abandon district lines enveloping the undisputed longstanding community of interest in the Gulf to be replaced by district lines dividing Black and white with such racial precision that Alabama could never have constitutionally drawn those lines in the first place. Yet, that is what Alabama has been commanded to do here: redraw its districts to subordinate traditional districting principles to race.   The only way to add a second majority-minority district to Alabama's plan is to make race the non-negotiable criterion. Plaintiffs' illustrative plans prove the point. They offer only one way to get that second majority-Black district: Split Mobile County and divide the Gulf by race.   Their new versions of Districts 1 and 2 then stretch the width of the state to group together Black voters from disparate areas as far west as Mobile and as far east as the Georgia border. The district court relied on these outlier plans to invalidate the state's neutrally drawn map.   That was legal error. Requiring states to scrap neutral plans in favor of plans drawn on account of race set Section 2 at war with itself and with the Constitution. The Court should make clear that if a state's plan is the product of the state's neutral districting principles, the plan is equally open to all voters.   Because Alabama's 2021 plan is such a plan, plaintiffs' claims fail. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " What would you use as a comparator? I -- I assume that your problem is that the comparator here was -- had race as a non- -- as non-negotiable.   What would you use as a comparator if -- even if you thought that there might be some vote dilution problems with your plan? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " The -- the plan that would be the adequate comparator would be one that respects all of our traditional districting principles as much as our own map but then has some different racial outcome, similar to what the Court has proposed in Cromartie 2, for example.   The -- that sort of map can actually show that there's a problem with our map, but if you are discriminating in favor of one racial group, then that map cannot show that our map was discriminating against that group.   It -- it's a flawed control. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, don't you think there's an overall problem with -- in these dilution cases of determining at the beginning what the comparator should be? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   I think, as this Court noted both in the Holder v. Hall plurality and in Brnovich, benchmarks are critical in any Section 2 case. And we proposed a benchmark to the Court.   Plaintiffs have not proposed any benchmark other than perhaps maximization or proportionality.   But, of course, Section 2 rejects a proportionality baseline, and this Court has wisely rejected maximization and proportionality because they lead to constitutional problems. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Do you agree that the benchmark you propose has never been recognized by this Court as the benchmark that's appropriate in these kinds of cases? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " I -- I don't think so, Justice Kagan.   First, I mean, going back to Gingles, I think the benchmark there even for multi-member districts was neutrally drawn single-member districts, not racially gerrymandered single-member districts. And then, when you continue -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Of course, you're requiring that there be that kind of benchmark. The question is not whether it's permissible. You are requiring that there be a race-neutral benchmark, and I'm asking whether that requirement has ever been stated in our precedents. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " I think that's what Bush v. Vera, what Abrams, and what LULAC were all pushing towards when they said you must account for traditional districting principles.   I don't know why you would even account for them except that if a plaintiff's failure to account for them in their map -- if -- if plaintiffs fail to account for them in their map, then their map can't really shed any light -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " -- on whether the problem -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess I ask because what strikes me about this case is that under our precedent it's kind of a slam dunk if you just take our existing precedent the way it is, and the three judges below all found this.   The three judges below said this is an easy case. It's not one of the hard ones.   It's not one of the boundary line cases. It was clear that the plaintiffs satisfied the Gingles preconditions.   It's -- in -- and -- and past that, you know, you're looking at a state where there are 27 -- 7 percent of the population is African American but only one of seven districts where there is incredible racially polarized voting, where there is a long history of racial discrimination in the state. Put all that together and it seems clear that under our existing precedents, the inquiry is complete in just the way that this -- that the -- that the -- that the court below found. And, you know, it seems to me that you're coming here, and it's totally your right to do it, but really saying, change the way we look at Section 2 and its application. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Absolutely not, Your Honor.   And, respectfully, I thought this was the -- this is such an edge case.   This is a case where the plaintiffs have come forward with an expert who said it's hard to draw a second majority-minority district by accident.   It's a case where the named plaintiff, Evan Milligan himself, showed it's hard to do it on purpose. He runs an Alabama-focused redistricting nonprofit.   He had a team of trained map drawers try to draw a second majority-Black district in Alabama and they couldn't do it.   That's at page 511 of the Joint Appendix. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " So, I'm sorry, can I just -- help -- I don't understand.   Are you saying that the Gingles preconditions as we ordinarily understand them were not satisfied in this case? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   I mean, the -- LULAC says -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And how so? How so? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " LULAC says quite clearly: Account for traditional districting principles, such as maintaining communities of interest and traditional boundaries.   There's an undisputed traditional -- rather an undisputed community of interest in the Gulf, the district court found that the Gulf community is a community of interest, and it's not maintained.   So I think it's open and shut under LULAC. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " No, I'm sorry.   So is -- so you're saying Step 1 was not satisfied in this case because the ordinary redistricting principles -- I thought this was about a race-blind algorithm, so now I'm confused. So what -- what is the problem? And let me just -- let me tell you why I think that matters, because much like what Justice Kagan was suggesting, we have to figure out whether you are claiming that we need to change Gingles in some fundamental way or whether you're just saying that these plaintiffs didn't satisfy Gingles in the way that we normally understand it. I thought you were saying Gingles Step 1 needs to be retooled to require some showing of a comparison with a race-neutral -- or, excuse me, a race-blind algorithm. And so then my question was: Okay, well, you would bear the burden, I think, of showing that there's a problem with the way that we're doing it now, that -- the way that Gingles is working, and that a race-blind algorithm actually produces a better result insofar as it's better implementing what Congress intended or it is required by the Constitution. All of those are pretty heavy burdens, I think, in this situation.   So are you asking us to reconsider what is happening with Gingles to require that challengers compare their original map at Step 1 with a race-blind algorithm? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " The -- the algorithms are not essential.   They're -- they're very helpful and illuminating in this case because the Milligan plaintiffs brought them themselves. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " What do they illuminate? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " They show that this is what you would expect a race-neutral map drawer to produce, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Why does that matter? I thought Congress's statute said we don't care about intent.   So the race-neutral nature of this goes to whether or not Alabama intended the result, and I take your point that, no, you didn't.   So what difference does it make what a race-neutral algorithm would do? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " It matters for at least three reasons, Your Honor, and this Court -- I mean, every time that a Section 2 case has be -- come before this Court and you've had to consider that interaction between Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause, you've reversed for someone using too much race and trying to -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Do you think that Section 2 sets out an intent standard? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Your Honor, I think that obvious -- it's undisputed that intent is relevant.   Intent has not been rendered irrelevant. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Sure.   You know, nobody disputes that intent isn't relevant.   The question is, is intent required? And when I read your brief, the -- all over it, you suggest that intent is required.   And I thought that we have said on numerous occasions that intent is not required, and the reason we've said it on numerous occasions is because that's what Congress said. We once long ago said that intent was required in Voting Right -- in the Voting Right -- Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and Congress immediately slapped us down and said no, we didn't mean that and made clear in the language of the statute that it was incorporating a results test, an effects test. And yet your -- your -- your arguments, as Justice Jackson has suggested, really say that that's wrong and that there needs to be a showing of intent in order to make out a Section 2 violation. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Two points on that.   I -- I will recognize there -- there's certainly dicta in the Court, Section 2 precedent suggesting that there doesn't have to be a showing of intent. What we have laid out in the brief is what we think the best reading of the text, which, when the Court -- when Congress decided to put in 2(b), that language from Whitcomb and from White v. Regester, they were importing an invidious discrimination test. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I -- I mean, to make this a question of dicta in the cases when you have Congress saying results in and then setting out an entire subsection about what it means to result in unequal access to the political process, and then Gingles says, well, we acknowledge that this was a response to Bolden, where we held that proof of discriminatory intent was required, and we say Congress revised Section 2 to make clear that a violation could be proved by showing discriminatory effect alone. And then we said it in Chisom.   And then we said it recently as a year ago -- I dissented from this decision, but Brnovich says the fact that Section 2 does not demand proof of discriminatory purpose is one of the points of law that nobody disputes. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Correct.   And, Your Honor, our position we've laid out and the Court obviously does not have to reach that in this case because we do think that the plaintiffs have brought such an edge case here that this should be easy to resolve on narrower grounds, but they imported from Whit and from White v. Regester what the Senate fact -- what the Senate report referred to as the White Results Test. Well, if you look back at White and if you look back at Whitcomb, they say invidious discrimination half a dozen times.   Justice White explained in his dissent in Mobile that they were requiring -- the plurality was requiring some sort of smoking gun proof identifying the exact official, and Justice White's position was no.   Circumstantial evidence can be enough to infer invidious discrimination -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " -- and that's exactly what he said -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I guess in -- like -- "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " -- in Rogers v. Lodge. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- do you -- do you agree with the solicitor general's statement in the government -- the federal government's brief that they -- you can take into account the factors that you're most concerned about, which is the computer simulations that show the effects of race-neutral criteria, that you can take those into account under the totality of the circumstances point, but they do not show any -- do not undermine the proposition that there's no requirement of showing intent? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " I think you can certainly take them into account at the totality of circumstances stage.   If you look at the district court's opinion here, though -- and -- and one other thing I'd note, in Brnovich, when this Court emphasized that the legitimate state goals are critical at that totality of the circumstances stage. And I think, in a single-member districting contest -- context, it's especially important that the Court be putting those legitimate goals front and center for at least two reasons. First, as this Court has said in every redistricting opinion that you've issued, redistricting is one of the most difficult and complex things that a legislature has to undertake and it's an area where courts are not particularly well-suited to come in and second-guess. But second and even more importantly, single-member districting is uniquely zero sum. So, if someone brings a challenge to an early voting period and says it's 10 days but really should be 20 and they prevail and get 10 more days, no one is harmed on account of race. The minority voters who prevailed and the majority voters can both take advantage of that. Similarly, if you challenge multi-member districts and you replace them with neutral single-member districts, no one's worse off on account of race. But, if you have a neutral plan and someone comes in and upsets it to racially gerrymander it in favor of one racial group, well, necessarily you're going to be harming some other group on account of race. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But, why are you saying -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- it's a neutral plan, counsel? I -- I don't understand.   The Gingles preconditions are designed to establish that there may actually be race discrimination working in this particular situation, right? We have, as Justice Kagan pointed out, not just the initial hypothesis, which, by the way, is how I look at the first step.   I don't think the first step is, you know, creating some sort of a comparator or anything of the sort. The first step is a burden on the plaintiff, on the challenger, to show that their hypothesis that another district could be drawn, another minority -- majority-minority district, is even feasible given the empirical numbers in the situation, all right? So, if we accept that, that's step number one, and it contains an assessment of things like racial segregation in housing because you have to have enough of these people pushed in, compacted in this district, right? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Mm-hmm. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " So we already have this idea that there's some problem because we have racial segregation in housing at Step 1. Then Step 2 is asking, do we have a problem in the sense that people are voting in racially polarized ways? Step 3 is also that kind of dynamic.   Do we have a situation in which the, you know, majority group is always voting in the same way? These are really tough things to establish, and, collectively, they show that it's not neutral, the situation that we are approaching in this situation.   We're talking about a situation in which race has already infused the voting system. So can you help me understand why you think that the world of, you know, race-blind redistricting is -- is really the starting point in this situation? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Well, let's think about why you have a compactness inquiry in the first place.   It's to make sure that no one is being harmed on account of a lack of compactness.   And that's why traditional districting principles are part of this inquiry too, so no one is being harmed -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " I don't think so.   I think it's to show that you have racial segregation in housing happening in this situation, that you have enough people who are in, you know, marginalized groups that another district is possible. And why is that happening? Because people are being segregated in effect, in effect, as Judge -- Justice Kagan pointed out, right? We're not talking about intent.   We're talking about the effect of what's happening on the ground in these jurisdictions. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Two points. First, on the segregation point, if -- if there really was that compact segregated part of Alabama to draw that second Black district, they wouldn't have had to have split Mobile for the first time ever, gone 170 miles northeast up to Montgomery, and then dipped a hundred miles to the southeast to Dothan, Alabama. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   So that's a different kind of arguments.   Those are -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But, counsel, you have a -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, you have made a number of arguments.   Some of them are quite far-reaching, and you've been questioned about some of those already in the argument today, but let me make sure I understand your -- your basic argument, your least far-reaching argument. And as I understood it, the argument is that the first Gingles precondition requires the showing that there can be a reasonably configured majority-minority district.   It's not just any old majority-minority district.   It has to be reasonably configured.   And reasonably configured means something more than just compact.   It means a district that is the type of district that would be drawn by an unbiased mapmaker. Now a plaintiff in a case like this can attempt to satisfy that first condition simply by coming forward with a district that is majority-minority, but that doesn't end the inquiry because, if it can be shown, as you claim the computer simulations in this case show, that that is not the kind of district that an unbiased mapmaker would ever draw, then the first Gingles precondition is not satisfied. Now that's how I understood your -- your basic argument.   Am I right on that? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Yes.   Yes, Your Honor. But you could also consider that at the totality of the circumstances -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And you could consider it at the totality of the circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Mm-hmm. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But your most basic argument is not at war with Gingles.   You have quarrels with Gingles, but your most basic argument fits right into Gingles. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Absolutely.   And in LULAC, the Court recognized the compactness inquiry lacked some precision.   Obviously -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Mr. LaCour -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " -- some precision was needed. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- it only fits with Gingles if Gingles meant reasonably configured in the way that Justice Alito suggests. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Mm-hmm. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But there's no indication in Gingles or in any of our cases that the Court did mean reasonably configured in the way that Justice Alito suggests. Reasonably configured meant take a look at a district.   Does the district have sort of reasonable lines, or are you doing something totally crazy? Does the district, you know, incorporate communities of interest? Does it -- you know, does it make sure that traditional districting criteria are satisfied? If you can come in with a map that looks like that, which plaintiffs here did -- nobody contests that even, or maybe you do.   I don't know.   Certainly, the judges below found that question very easy. Then you go on.   This is just a precondition to show that you have a map that accords with traditional districting criteria. They had that map. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " With -- with respect, first, again, I'm not sure why the Court has ever spoken about traditional districting principles and reasonable configuration, or at least the Court has never suggested that a map that the state could never enact itself under the Equal Protection Clause is somehow reasonably configured.   If they came forward with a Cooper v. Harris map or the Bethune-Hill map -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But why is that -- "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " -- surely, that's not reasonably configured. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- the question at Step 1, counsel? Why is that the question -- at Step 1, we're not even worried about the state's map.   We're asking the -- the -- the challengers, it's a burden on the challengers, can you sustain your hypothesis that under traditional redistricting principles we can have a map that is drawn the way we ordinarily draw maps and in -- has a majority of minorities? It's not about the state's map at 1. So I don't understand why we would have to ensure that the challengers' map conforms with other legal requirements. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " With respect, this whole case is about the state's map.   The whole Section 2 inquiry should be about the state's map.   And there's something bizarre with the fact that, like, we have to somehow show that there's something so wrong with their map -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " No, counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " -- so our map gets to stand. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- it's like -- it's like -- it's like the burden-shifting tests that this Court has in all kinds of other discrimination.   It's like McDonnell Douglas, right? At Step 1, the challengers have to do something. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Mm-hmm. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And in -- in this case, they have to do something really hard. They have three different hurdles that they have to jump over in order to even get us to question Alabama's maps.   And at Step 1, they have to show this empirical thing.   And I don't understand why you are now suggesting that the Step 1 has to also relate to the legality of that map.   That's not the ultimate map that it's going to be, right? Even if they win, Alabama has the opportunity to put out its own map.   So they're just doing a particular thing at Step 1. And I don't understand your -- your argument. "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " With -- with respect, Your Honor, this Court has said account for traditional districting principles, and if they get to leave a few of those aside, then that hurdle becomes very low.

You dispute that.   We can go into the record.   There is a fight here, however, over what's a continuing existing community of interest.

Now the question is, why? What the district court did was to look at that community and say: It may be Black, but that's irrelevant to what constitutes a community of interest.   It's not merely its race.   It's its socioeconomic background, it's educational level, it's occupation.   It's all of the things that one would look at to define a community of interest. And that community of interest should be held together because, just like Mobile and Baldwin, assuming -- and the district court didn't -- held that you hadn't met your burden on that actually being a community of interest, but even if you wanted to keep it that way, my question to you is, assume I accept that as a community of interest.

That's at page 122. So there's no dispute there that there is a community of interest, nor -- nor could there be.

But Dr. Imai, he was their -- he was the Milligan plaintiffs' expert who was working with the 2020 data. And he drew 10,000 -- three sets of 10,000 maps.   The third set guaranteed one majority Black district of 50 to 51 percent, razor thin, leaving as many Black voters as possible to find in the other six districts and form a second majority-minority district, then contiguity equal population, keep counties together, stay relatively compact, don't pair incumbents and then prioritize communities of interest. And they've said again and again that he didn't take into account communities of interest.   That is flatly wrong.   He did.

It's one of the great achievements of American democracy to achieve equal political opportunities regardless of race, to ensure that African Americans could have as much political power as -- as -- as white Americans could.   That's a pretty big deal. And it was strengthened, this statute, in 1982 when this Court interpreted it too narrowly for Congress's taste, and Congress said no, we didn't mean that at all and made this into a results test. Now, in recent years, this statute has fared not well in this Court.   Shelby County looks at Section 5 and it says no, Section 5, we don't need that anymore, and one of the things it says is we have Section 2. And then Brnovich comes along, and that's a Section 2 case, and the Court says: You know what, Section 2, they're really dilution claims.   You know, this is a denial claim, and -- and so we can construe that very narrowly.   But, of course, there's just all these cases that are dilution claims.   That's really what Section 2 is about. And now here we are, Section 2 is a dilution claim, this -- you know, the classic Section 2 dilution claim.

We had the second highest Black registration in the country, second only to Mississippi.   So I think we need to not lose sight of that. In terms of what Section 2 is supposed to be doing, I think the problem here is we're kind of in like a third generation of vote dilution claims.   You have the multi-member districts is generation 1.   Generation 2 was getting rid of the racial gerrymanders.   But generation 3 is let's impose the racial gerrymanders, which I don't think Section 2 was ever designed to do.   It's what's led to all this confusion and this tension between an equal openness statute and equal protection mandate. And we're just saying, like, that cannot be what it means.   What -- whatever it means, it can't be that we have to obliterate longstanding, unprecedented -- I mean undisputed communities of interest in favor of districts that sort of arch across the state to connect people from Mobile and -- and Dothan, which no neutral map drawer would ever do.

I am so, so glad for Justice Barrett's clarification because I had the same thought about what you were arguing, and I'm glad that you clarified that your core point is that the Gingles test has to have a race-neutral baseline or that the -- the first step has to be race-neutral. And -- and what I guess I'm a little confused about in light of that argument is why, given our normal assessment of the Constitution, why is it that you think that there's a Fourteenth Amendment problem? And let me just clarify what I mean by that. I don't think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem, because I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution at what the Framers and the Founders thought about and when I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the Framers themselves adopted the Equal Protection Clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race-conscious way. That they were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against, the freedmen in -- during the reconstructive -- Reconstruction period were actually brought equal to everyone else in the society. So I looked at the report that was submitted by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, and that report says that the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. The legislator who introduced that amendment said that \"unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen.\" That's not -- that's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy.   And -- and even more than that, I don't think that the historical record establishes that the Founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required, right? They drafted the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which specifically stated that citizens would have the same civil rights as enjoyed by white citizens. That's the point of that Act, to make sure that the other citizens, the Black citizens, would have the same as the white citizens.   So they recognized that there was unequal treatment, that people, based on their race, were being treated unequally. And, importantly, when there was a concern that the Civil Rights Act wouldn't have a constitutional foundation, that's when the Fourteenth Amendment came into play.   It was drafted to give a foundational -- a constitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make people who had less opportunity and less rights equal to white citizens. So with that as the framing and the background, I'm trying to understand your position that Section 2, which by its plain text is doing that same thing, is saying you need to identify people in this community who have less opportunity and less ability to participate and ensure that that's remedied, right?

The district court's unanimous and thorough intensely local analysis did not err in finding that the Black Belt is a historic and extremely poor community of substantial significance.   Yet, Alabama's map cracks that community and allows white block voting to deny Black voters the opportunity to elect representation responsive to their needs. Rather than argue clear error, Alabama asks us to ignore statutory stare decisis and to rewrite Section 2's text.   But the Voting Rights Act is a remedial statute that Congress has twice reenacted since Gingles, and its application here raises no constitutional concerns. That is because plaintiffs' maps show, consistent with Bartlett, that it is possible to draw maps that look very similar to Alabama's own Board of Education map and that increase opportunities for minority voters, while satisfying traditional and state redistricting criteria at least as well as Alabama's map. Nothing in the text of Section 2 allows Alabama to avoid liability by offering up these post hoc rationalizations of simulations and core retention for maps that result in discrimination.   In fact, Alabama called simulations fundamentally flawed for not reproducing its own map and for not incorporating all traditional redistricting criteria. At Gingles 1, this Court requires us to use sample plans that Alabama is not ultimately obligated to adopt, but those plans need not be the ultimate remedy.   And that's because, as this Court said in Brnovich, Section 2 looks at the totality of the circumstances, not, as Alabama would have it, the totality of just one. Section 2 is not an intent test or about putting on racial blinders.   It is about equal opportunity, opportunity that Alabama's map denies Black voters.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

First of all, the -- when a lot of these districts were drawn pursuant to the Voting Rights Act, including in Alabama itself, 1992 was a Court-ordered plan where CD 7 was created for the first time. So these districts were not necessarily drawn in this -- in idea that they were -- had to be race-blind or race-neutral. They were solving a problem of racial discrimination that they were looking at race in order to solve that problem.   They were not necessarily drawn in a race-neutral way. I also think that these -- the fact that these simulations are not capturing these existing -- these communities and these districts, many of which have been in place for many -- for a long time, goes to the fundamental flaw of overly relying on these simulations. And I think that it's important to recognize, you know, a lot of the -- a lot of stock has been put in these simulations in the course of this appellate argument, but as -- as my friend recognized, there were fun -- these were deemed by the state to be fundamentally flawed below. And there's a few reasons why it is just -- both impractical as a -- as a -- as a practical matter and a policy matter, these simulations just are not any kind of gold standard.   They are not this objective race-neutral benchmark that -- that anyone might think that they are.

Gingles inquiry is a basic demographic question about how big is the back -- Black population and where are they located?

The -- Alabama's expert here below acknowledged that that -- did not testify that our maps were not reasonably compact and acknowledged there is no bright-line rule.   So even inputting those criteria into a computer algorithm requires coming up with some bright-line rules that don't currently exist.

So you were saying that they're inherently subjective because it depends on how you weight factors and what factors you put in. I just want to be sure I understand what you mean by that, because it seems to me that, if you can generate, if there's no limit on how many maps the computer simulator can generate, surely that gives them the option to weigh in all kinds of different ways. And it also seems to me, and maybe I'm misunderstanding Alabama's proposal, but it also seems to me that under Alabama's view of the statute, the plaintiff satisfies Gingles 1 by coming in with one map that was drawn without taking race into account.

That wasn't my non-negotiable goal.   So I don't -- I don't -- I wasn't suggesting that. I was just asking the technical question.   You said that these computer simulations are not neutral by definition because they require subjective judgments in the programming.   So if you could answer that.

We know that the ones at issue here did not include a host of considerations.   How do you quantify some of those considerations, like communities of interest and compactness? It's not like we have a bright-line rule that says a point 3 district is or is not compact.   You have to come to some kind of agreement or decision among the experts or among the Court on what these factors are. How do we weight the various factors? Do some get more importance depending on their fall -- where they fall in the state's traditional districting criteria, as well affected in their guidelines or something else? How do we interpret the results? Does it need to be a million, 2 million, 3 trillion? As we learned from the computer scientists' amicus brief, there could be trillions and trillions, that certainly will at some point come up with at least one possible configuration. Or we can just use this test that this Court has always established, which is as long as you come into court with a map that shows the potential to draw a majority-Black district that is reasonably configured according to the state's traditional districting principles, then that is sufficient to get past just the first post and not the gauntlet of remaining factors after that.

So following up on Justice Barrett's question, setting aside the practicalities of the map-making process, which is basically what you've been focusing on, I think the question is, why should we make the Gingles 1 challengers do that? In other words, it seems as though some of my colleagues are asking the question if -- you know, if you have a million maps and you can generate a million maps, why shouldn't we require that one map be drawn in a race-neutral way? And I actually think the question is, why should we require at Gingles Step 1 that a map be drawn in a race-neutral way? And there are two possibilities, right? It's -- one possibility is because that's what Congress would have wanted, but when I read Section 2, I don't see that Congress is requiring race neutrality. In fact, the language beyond equally open is equally open by participation of members in a particular class of citizens in that its members have less opportunity than other members.   So it seems as though Congress is authorizing the consideration of race. And then the second question is, all right, why should we do this? Because the Constitution requires some sort of race neutrality, and based on my colloquy with -- with -- with your friend on the other side, I think that the Constitution doesn't require it.

It would be a brand-new principle that really doesn't serve any end, the end result is -- the end result gets us to the exact same place that we have right now, which is, is it possible to show up in court with a district that meets these criteria? And to the -- you know -- and, here, where we talk about what does -- what does the usual map drawer in Alabama draw, what gets considered a sprawling district in Alabama, the best place to look is to the very guidelines that -- that my friend on the other side specifically mentioned. And those guidelines take into account contiguity, compactness, political subdivision boundaries, precincts, all of these things that our maps performed as good or better and they also take into account race, and they say that you -- complying with the Voting Rights Act shall come before anything else and specifically including core preservations and communities of interest.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " General Prelogar. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court's factual findings make this an extreme and atypical case of vote dilution.   Voting in Alabama is intensely racially polarized, about as stark as anywhere in the country. The history and effects of racial discrimination in the state are severe.   Black voters are significantly underrepresented and they're sufficiently numerous and compact to form a majority in a reasonably configured district, as the district court specifically found. Section 2's results test was designed for this kind of case.   For that reason, Alabama isn't asking the Court to apply Section 2 as it's been applied for the past 40 years. Instead, Alabama is asking the Court to radically change the law by inserting this concept of race neutrality and effectively limiting Section 2 to intentional discrimination. That approach would delete the text that Congress added in 1982 to cover results. It disregards nearly four decades of this Court's precedent, and it would have drastic real-world consequences. Under the state's approach, nothing would stop Alabama and many other states from dismantling their existing majority-minority districts, leaving Black voters and entire swaths of the country with no ability to elect their preferred representatives. The Court should reject that destabilizing and atextual interpretation of Section 2. I'd like to turn if I could to the questions that Justice Barrett and Justice Jackson were just asking about the narrower form of Alabama's argument and specifically whether it makes sense to put plaintiffs to the burden of showing that they can draw their maps in a race-neutral way. And I think the problem with that approach is that it's contrary to the text, would be unworkable in practice, and it also is unnecessary to address the concern Alabama's raising about unconstitutional districts. So if I could just unpack that a little bit.   Specifically, with respect to the text, the problem with using race neutrality as the touchstone here is that's inherently focused on motives or purposes in designing the districts, and I think one thing that has been clear for the past four decades, ever since Congress amended the statute, is that that is no longer the necessary requirement under Section 2. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But, what about equal opportunity? So that's my concern.   You know, as Judge Easterbrook said in the Seventh Circuit, that you have to have a baseline. Equal as to what? And if the vote is going to be diluted, you know, it's diluted as compared to what, to the opportunity? I mean, I think -- I think that's the part of the statute that concerns me, thinking about neutrality. Because I -- I agree with you that it does not require intent.   I agree with you about the results test.   But the equal opportunity is what I'm thinking of. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " So I think -- to focus on that in particular, the statute goes on specifically to define what it means by equal opportunity, Justice Barrett.   And it's setting up a comparison between two groups of voters. Specifically, do minority voters have less opportunity than other members of the electorate? So it's right there in the statute creating the by -- the baseline or the comparison group. Now, I get that that's what I think is the easy part of the equation, and then it just raises the question of when you can say that minority voters have less opportunity within the terms of the statute.   And there I think the Gingles framework already guides courts to the relevant factors to take into account.   It's the three preconditions and then the rigorous analysis of the totality of the circumstances that's critical to making that quintessentially legal judgment of when there's less opportunity. But if I could pick up on the idea as well of why I think it would be so unworkable in practice to try to inject this idea of race neutrality, you know, the whole function of the first Gingles precondition is to require plaintiffs to show that you can intentionally create a majority-minority district.   And if they have to do that without taking any account of race, then they effectively have to kind of stumble into the district by accident. And I think that will inevitably lead to running these kinds of simulations that have been discussed at length this morning that are incredibly complicated to try to operationalize -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

We're not suggesting that the evidence would be wholly irrelevant, but I do think that it would be a -- an incredibly complicated obstacle to trying to litigate these cases if it were necessary at Gingles Step 1 for the plaintiffs to duke it out among their experts and debate about all of the things to feed into the algorithm to -- to -- to identify whether it's -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

They're not going to win on whether the majority votes as a bloc, which may be due to ideology and not have anything to do with race.

And I want to resist strongly this idea that any time plaintiffs have been able to satisfy that first Gingles precondition, they automatically prove their case. This is a rigorous burden on plaintiffs.   Of course, they have to show the patterns of racially polarized voting in the second and third preconditions, and courts then go on to look at all of the relevant circumstances in the totality analysis. And if you actually look at actual results in these cases, there are -- are steadily decreasing Section 2 claims that are filed in the first place.   And then it's not as though plaintiffs always prevail in those claims.   Courts routinely reject them because the other factors aren't satisfied. So I think it would just be incorrect to suggest at the outset that simply by virtue of showing that first threshold screen the plaintiffs are -- are going to be able to run the table.

In your brief on 16 and 17, I think you identify it lacks the bizarre shapes that the Court has found problematic and performs at least as well as the plan in respecting existing political subdivisions, so kind of a comparison to the state's plan.

And what the court did is look at every traditional redistricting criteria in Alabama, compactness, contiguity, equalizing population across districts, respect for the political subdivision boundary lines, municipalities, not splitting counties, as you mentioned, and protecting communities of interest as -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

Prelogar", "text": " Yes, it's generally a geographic compactness inquiry, both of the district itself but also of the minority population that would be drawn together within that district.   And the -- the court here applied a number of different measures. As your question indicated, there are several different metrics in how to measure compactness in redistricting litigation.   The court here went through all of them, and it said that down the line looking at the traditional districting criteria, these districts, as my friend said, performed as well or better than the enacted plan on nearly all of the relevant criteria. And that's, of course, something this Court has recognized as reviewable only for clear error.   So to the extent that you think that this is a tough question and maybe a different fact finder could have reached a different result, I think that's precisely why the Court has recognized that the district court's decision merits a substantial amount of deference in this kind of area. I'd like to, if I could, try to complete my answer on why I think trying to incorporate race neutrality into the first Gingles precondition is also unnecessary.   If I understand the state's argument correctly, the state is suggesting that this is the way to ensure that a state is not required to draw an unconstitutional racial gerrymander on the back end at the remedial stage. And I think the problem with that argument is it ignores that there are already, I would say, four independent checks in existing doctrine that ensure the state will never be put in that position. The first thing is the fact that the Gingles first precondition already requires that the district not be bizarrely shaped.   It has to be reasonably configured.   So we're in a world where there would never be a -- a illustrative plan that itself constituted that kind of behemoth district that the Court disapproved in cases like Shaw. The second thing I would point to is that the state is wrongly equating any use of race in the redistricting process with an unconstitutional action.   And -- and that ignores the careful lines this Court has drawn in the Shaw line of cases to make clear that it's only when race predominates, when it's the overriding and dominant rationale, that the state has to justify its map under strict scrutiny.   And -- and here it bears emphasis the district court specifically found race did not predominate.   And that's another thing that's reviewed for clear error. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if -- if a computer simulation can produce this second majority-minority district only by insisting that -- this -- that that district be created, subordinating all the other districting factors to race, isn't that predominance? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Well, the way that this Court has described the predominance standard is that the -- the state has basically subjugated all other traditional districting criteria.   It's often revealed by the fact that the district is bizarre by any measure and is irregularly shaped, although that's not an absolute requirement. But I think that the first Gingles precondition already guards against that because, of course, to satisfy Step 1 of the framework, the plaintiff has to come in with a reasonably configured district at the outset. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I -- I don't really understand your answer to my question.   If a computer program can produce this district only by making the creation of that district the sine qua non and subordinating everything else, isn't that the very definition of -- of predominance? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " I -- I think not as this Court has articulated the standard.   So the Court has recognized, for example, or has never suggested that simply because you intentionally create a majority-minority district, that automatically means in every case that race predominated.   And in the Bethune-Hill case, the Court specifically remanded a case where there had been a 55 percent target used for the district court to make a finding on predominance. So I don't think that that is inevitably the answer.   And the reason for that is because it's often possible to give great attention and weight to other districting criteria.   That's specifically what the plaintiffs' experts did here according to the district court's factual findings. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And not just possible, required.   I mean, we're -- there -- there's not a subordination of the other districting criteria.   It's as if -- you know, in a hypothetical world, it's as if there are 50 normal, you know, regular traditional criteria, and the computer runs the 50, and the challenger's experts run the 50 and they add race, and the question -- as -- as criteria 51. And the question I would think from the standpoint of predominance would be, is the consideration of that one additional factor, which would necessarily produce different maps because, if you change one small part of an algorithm, you would see that you might have different results. So, fine, we have different results because the experts use 51 criteria and the computer used 50, but the question I think is whether just the use of that extra one, because it differentiates, means that it predominates. And I don't think that's what -- what Shaw means when it says predominant. Am I right about that or -- "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Yes, I think you're exactly right, Justice Jackson.   And the Court, in fact, in this line of cases has said that legislators are always aware of race when they draw district lines. That alone isn't a basis to condemn their maps or even subject it to strict scrutiny specifically to ensure that federal courts aren't too readily called in to superintend the state line-drawing process. And so I think that this Court's precedents rightly recognize that states deserve a measure of flexibility in managing all of the competing interests that go into districting decisions, and that can quite properly include obligations under the Voting Rights Act.

If you ran one, shouldn't the state come back and say, well, you need more than one in a million? Surely, like, you should have a hundred.   Surely, you should have a thousand. Surely, it should be the median map.   I mean, why one? "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B.

Is -- is one map enough? Do you need a hundred, a thousand? They don't say. And I think that that just demonstrates that this is an incredibly untested form of evidence.   It's never been required in Section 2 litigation.

It's not an area where the Court's decisions have flown under the radar or escaped notice. Congress has not hesitated to step in and alter the statute when it's been dissatisfied with this Court's interpretation. That was the whole point of the 1982 amendments. So I think that's Exhibit A of the principle here. And far from disrupting or disturbing the Gingles framework in any way, Congress has repeatedly left Section 2 untouched while it's amended other aspects of the statute. And in the 2006 amendments, the House report specifically noted that Congress did not intend any departure from Gingles or its progeny. So I think that those stare decisis considerations really weigh heavily in the balance here. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel. Mr. LaCour, rebuttal? "}, {"speaker": "Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.", "text": " Thank you.   I've got about five quick points.   I'll try to get through all of them. Justice Kavanaugh, to your point, it is not a departure from Gingles to clarify. This Court didn't depart from Gingles and De Grandy when it recognized the importance of proportionality.   You didn't depart from Gingles when you added traditional districting principles to the analysis when the Court started focusing on single-member districts.   So we are not asking for Gingles to be overruled or changed in any dramatic way.   We just need some clarification. And a couple points about the clear error or the standard of review.   When it comes to compactness, that was a legal error because they left out important traditional districting principles and -- and said that's fine, you only have to account for some of the traditional districting principles, not all of them. It's -- it's very easy to satisfy Gingles if you get to play by completely different rules, and Gingles just isn't going to do anything useful if that's the case. When it comes to predominance, that's a legal error.   Just like in Bethune-Hill, just like in ALBC, that's reviewed de novo. Now the main point, I mean, courts can -- the Court can resolve this case by clarifying that race cannot be the non-negotiable principle as part of Section 2 liability. Simulations are not required.   We just need to make sure that plaintiffs are coming forward with some sort of evidence that resembles what you would think a race-neutral map drawer would do within the confines of the Equal Protection Clause because, if you read Section 2 to be inconsistent with Cooper and Bethune-Hill, then our maps are always going to be in court. And we've got a real live example of this with the Louisiana case that's pending before this Court as well.   Back in the '90s, they drew two majority-Black districts.   Twice district courts said that's racial gerrymandering and tossed them out.   So then they drew one majority-Black district, and now this year they were -- their -- their map is again preliminarily enjoined for failure to draw two majority-Black districts.   I think it's a perfect example of just how the states are caught in the middle here. And it's because the plaintiffs don't have a clear test.   We -- we -- maximization is not the test.   Proportionality is not the test. Some smattering of seven factors doesn't provide sort of guidance we need either.   That only identifies broad societal discrimination, not the sort of discrimination needed to justify race-based map drawing. So, if you return to the text, there really is no better test that ensures equal opportunity and equal openness than a map that looks like what you would expect a neutral map drawer to draw, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause. I mean, imagine for a second that you are a member of the Georgia legislature and all your guidance on Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause comes from the district court opinion below.   You would be completely in the dark. You know that you can account for traditional districting principles, but, apparently, one of your most important communities of interest down in the Gulf is not a sufficient community of interest to justify drawing a neutral map. You know that you've maintained cores of your districts and that Supreme Court in Abrams even said that's fine as part of the -- the Gingles 1 analysis, but the district court said, well, here, it's not going to be the case. So your map is going to end up in court again and again.   That -- that cannot be the case.   We need some sort of guidance from this Court. In sum, the purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to prevent discrimination and to foster our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on race, but plaintiffs would transform that statute into one that requires racial discrimination in districting and carries us further from the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters. Neither the text nor purpose of the Act supports that balkanizing approach, and the Constitution forbids it.   If Section 2 is to apply to single-member districts, then only a race-neutral benchmark furthers the VRA's goals of -- and its equal openness touchstone. And because Alabama's neutrally drawn plan is equally open to all voters, it complies with Section 2.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.
