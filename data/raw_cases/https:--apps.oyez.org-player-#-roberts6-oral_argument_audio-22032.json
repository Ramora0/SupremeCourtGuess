[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v. Jones.   Mr. Dreeben. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Since this Court's decision in Katz v. United States, the Court has recognized a basic dichotomy under the Fourth Amendment.   What a person seeks to preserve as private in the enclave of his own home or in a private letter or inside of his vehicle when he is traveling is a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.   But what he reveals to the world, such as his movements in a car on a public roadway, is not.   In Knotts v. United States, this Court applied that principle to hold that visual and beeper surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public roadways infringed no Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Knotts, though, seems to me much more like traditional surveillance.   You're following the car and the beeper just helps you follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance.   That was 30 years ago.   The technology is very different and you get a lot more information from the GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " The technology is different, Mr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that shows that this was not simply amplified visual surveillance is that the officers actually feared detection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to Wisconsin.   The driver began to do certain U-turns and the police broke off visual surveillance.   They lost track of the car for a full hour.   They only were able to discover it by having a beeper receiver in a helicopter that detected the beeps from the radio transmitter in the can of chloroform. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But that's a good example of the change in technology.   That's a lot of work to follow the car.   They've got to listen to the beeper; when they lose it they have got to call in the helicopter.   Here they just sit back in the station and they -- they push a button whenever they want to find out where the car is.   They look at data from a month and find out everywhere it's been in the past month.   That -- that seems to me dramatically different. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " But it doesn't expose anything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed to public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that was the crucial principle that the Court applied-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, under that rationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the man's overcoat or sport coat? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --Probably not, Justice Kennedy; and the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United States -- United States v. Karo -- specifically distinguished the possibility of following a car on a public roadways from determining the location of an object in a place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Oh -- oh, no.   This is special device.   It measures only streets and public elevators and public buildings. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " In that event, Justice Kennedy, there is a serious question about whether the installation of such a device would implicate either a search or a seizure.   But if it did not, the public movements of somebody do not implicate a seizure. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And on that latter point, you might just be aware that I have serious reservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about the way in which this beeper was installed.   But you can get to that at -- at your convenience. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to get to it now.   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " Happy to, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I have to give a little prologue to my question.   When -- when wiretapping first came before this Court, we held that it was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth Amendment says that the --   \"the people shall be secured in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures; and wiretapping just picked up conversations. \"   \"That's not persons, houses, papers and effects. \"   Later on, we reversed ourselves and, as you mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is, is there an invasion of privacy?   Does -- are you obtaining information that a person had a reasonable expectation to be kept private?   I think that was wrong.   I don't think that was the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment.   But nonetheless it's been around for so long, we are not going to overrule that.   However, it is one thing to add that privacy concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally existed and it is quite something else to use that concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it originally meant.   And it seems to me that when that device is installed against the will of the owner of the car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an unreasonable search and seizure.   It is attached to the car against his will, and it is a search because what it obtains is the location of that car from there forward.   Now, why -- why isn't that correct?   Do you deny that it's a trespass? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " It may be a technical trespass, but it was equally a technical trespass in the United States v. Karo when a can of ether was transferred to somebody that had -- and it had a radio transmitter-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, but the owner of the can at the time it was installed consented, and that is not this case.   There is no consent by the owner of the property to which this device was affixed.   In fact, it was done, as Justice Scalia indicated, surreptitiously. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --But there was no consent to the owner of the can once he acquired it to have it contain a foreign item installed by the government. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, that's too bad.   That doesn't make it a trespass.   I mean-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " Well, this Court thought that it-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --It may be a sneaky thing to do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --Well, this Court thought that it was a technical trespass in Karo and said that made no difference because the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful interferences with possessory interests, not to cover all technical trespasses.   And the case that I-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So we've narrowed the Fourth Amendment? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --Well, I think the Court-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So the -- the privacy rationale doesn't expand it, but narrows it in some respects. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --It changes it, Justice Scalia.   And I think the case that most clearly illustrates the distinction between trespass and Fourth Amendment protection is Oliver v. United States, the case that reaffirmed the open fields doctrine.   In that case, there was absolutely no doubt that the police committed a trespass under local law.   They entered, they crossed fences, they ignored big \"no trespassing\" signs; and this Court held that the interests that are protected by trespass law are distinct from the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Undoubtedly, but the rationale of that case was that it was not an unreasonable-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " No, the rationale was that-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --it was not an unreasonable search. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --there was no search, Justice Scalia.   The rationale of that case was that open fields are not among the things that are protected by the Fourth Amendment.   And the Court was very specifically focused on the distinction between trespass law and Fourth Amendment law. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You think there would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month?   You think you're entitled to do that under your theory? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " The justices of this Court? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Yes.   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " Under our theory and under this Court's cases, the justices of this Court when driving on public roadways have no greater expectation-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So your answer is yes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device on every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no problem under the Constitution? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --Well, equally, Mr. Chief Justice, if the FBI wanted to it could put its team of surveillance agents around the clock on any individual and follow that individual's movements as they went around on the public streets and they would thereby gather-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, that seems to get -- to me to get to what's really involved here, the issue of whether there is a technical trespass or not is potentially a ground for deciding this particular case, but it seems to me the heart of the problem that's presented by this case and will be presented by other cases involving new technology is that in the pre-computer, pre-Internet age much of the privacy -- I would say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was not the result of legal protections or constitutional protections; it was the result simply of the difficulty of traveling around and gathering up information.   But with computers, it's now so simple to amass an enormous amount of information about people that consists of things that could have been observed on the streets, information that was made available to the public.   If -- if this case is decided on the ground that there was a technical trespass, I don't have much doubt that in the near future it will be probable -- I think it's possible now in many instances -- for law enforcement to monitor people's movements on -- on public streets without committing a technical trespass.   So how do we deal with this?   Do we just say, well, nothing is changed, so that all the information that people expose to the public -- is, is fair game?   There is no -- there is no search or seizure when that is -- when that is obtained, because there isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy?   But isn't there a real change in -- in this regard? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --I don't think, Justice Alito, that there is a particularly dramatic change in this case from what went on in the Karo and the Knotts cases.   It is possible to envision broader advances in technology that would allow more public information to be amassed and put into computer systems.   But I think that the remedy for that, if this Court agrees with the principles in Knotts and Karo and applies them to this case, the remedy is through legislation, just as when the Court held that amassing pen register data, all of the numbers that you dial on your telephone, the lengths of the times of the calls.   The Court was confronted in that case with Justice Stewart's view in dissent-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But it -- it is a third party involved in the telephone -- in the pen register case.   And here, it's the police.   Essentially, I think you answered the question that the government's position would mean that any of us could be monitored whenever we leave our -- our homes, so the only thing secure is the home.   Is -- I mean, this is -- that is the end point of your argument, that an electronic device, as long as it's not used inside the house, is okay. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --Well, we are talking here about monitoring somebody's movements in public.   We are not talking about monitoring their conversations, their telephone calls, the interior of their cars, their private letters or packages.   So there are enclaves of Fourth Amendment protection that this Court has recognized. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But what -- but what is the question that I think people are driving at, at least as I understand it and certainly share the concern, is that if you win this case then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States.   And -- and the difference between the monitoring and what happened in the past is memories are fallible, computers aren't.   And no one, at least very rarely, sends human beings to follow people 24 hours a day.   That occasionally happens.   But with the machines, you can.   So if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like 1984 from their brief.   I understand they have an interest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe overly.   But it still sounds like it.   And so what protection is there, if any, once we accept your view of the case, from this slight futuristic scenario that's just been painted, and is done more so in their briefs? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " Justice Breyer, first of all, this is exactly the argument that was presented to the Court in Knotts.   If you go back to 1983, the beeper technology in that case seemed extraordinarily advanced and there was a potential for it to be used.   The-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Of course, that's true.   And they do have a limit.   In this case, they say Knotts involved a single journey, or let's say it involved four journeys.   And let's say it involved 4 journeys in 2 days.   This involves every journey for a month, so they say whatever the line is that's going to protect us, it's short of every journey in a month.   So I'm not asking -- I'm saying I accept your point there, and what do you say is the limit? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --I first want to address the suggestion that you could draw a line somewhere between a month and a trip and have a workable standard for police officers to use.   Police officers use a variety of investigative techniques which in the aggregate produce an enormous amount of information.   Pen registers, trash pulls; they look at financial records.   They conduct visual surveillance.   And under a principle of law that says 1 trip is okay but 30 trips in not, there is absolutely no guidance for law enforcement in how they are-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, there is the same kind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court that uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I think it's used for example in the bribing the judge case, you know, with campaign contributions.   You draw an outer limit, you say you can't go beyond that.   We know within that there is no standard.   We'll leave it for the lower courts to work out and we'll review it over time.   That's not necessarily desirable, but that is a method this Court has sometimes used.   But even if it's wrong, I want to know, are you saying there is no limit or are you suggesting one? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --I'm suggesting that the Court do the same thing that it did in Knotts.   This case does not involve 24-hour surveillance of every citizen of the United States.   It involves following one suspected drug dealer as to whom there was very strong suspicion, for a period of time that actually is less than a month, because the beeper technology failed during-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, then you're -- you're moving away from your argument.   Your argument is, it doesn't depend how much suspicion you have, it doesn't depend on how urgent it is.   Your argument is you can do it, period.   You don't have to give any reason.   It doesn't have to be limited in any way, right? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, isn't the normal way in these situations that we draw these limits how intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " When you're talking about the movements of a car on a public roadway, which even Justice Breyer's question seems to concede could be monitored for a day or perhaps 4 days, there is no Fourth Amendment search -- unless-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, you're talking about the difference between seeing the little tile and seeing a mosaic.   The one gives you information, the other doesn't. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --So does a pen register, so does a garbage pull.   So does looking at everybody's credit card statement for a month.   All of those things this Court has held are not searches.   And that-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Dreeben, this case started out with a warrant.   There was a warrant and the limits weren't followed.   The warrant said 10 days, do this in 10 days, and the police took 11.   They were supposed to do it in D.C. Instead, they did it in Maryland.   So the police could have gotten permission to conduct this search.   In fact, they had received it.   Now, I take it that the practice had been, because it's in the electronic surveillance manual, that you better get a warrant.   Was there any problem about when this kind of surveillance is wanted by the government, get a warrant?   Were they encountering difficulty getting warrants? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --In this case, there would not have been any difficulty getting a warrant, Justice Ginsburg.   And the warrant authorized things beyond just monitoring the car.   It authorized entering the car in order to install it, which wasn't necessary here.   It also authorized monitoring the car in a location where there was a reasonable expectation of privacy.   This case is only about monitoring a car on public streets.   But I think it's very important to keep in mind that the -- the principal use of this kind of surveillance is when the police have not yet acquired probable cause, but have a situation that does call for monitoring.   And I'd like to give an example.   If the police get an anonymous phone call that a bomb threat is going to be carried out at a mosque by people who work at a small company, the bomb threat on an anonymous call will not provide even reasonable suspicion under this Court's decision in Florida v. J.L.--   But you can hardly expect the FBI to ignore a credible, detailed-sounding piece of information like that.   Now, the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Then why are you asking for a different rule in this situation? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " Because the -- the police in this situation have the traditional means available to investigate these sorts of tips.   They could put teams of agents on all the individuals who are within the pool of suspicion and follow them 24/7.   And that would raise-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You're -- you're now suggesting n answer to Justice Kennedy's question, which is it would be okay to take this computer chip, put it on somebody's overcoat and follow every citizen everywhere they go indefinitely.   So -- under your theory, and the theory espoused in your brief, you could monitor and track every person through their cell phone, because today the smartphones emit signals that police can pick up and use to follow someone anywhere they go.   Your theory is so long as the -- that all -- that what is being monitored is the movement of person, of a person, they have no reasonable expectation that their possessions will not be used by you.   That's really the bottom line-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --I think that-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --to track them, to invade their sense of integrity in their choices about who they want to see or use their things.   That's really argument you're making. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think that that goes considerably farther than our position in this case, because our position is not that the Court should overrule United States v. Karo and permit monitoring within a private residence.   That is off limits absent a warrant or exigent circumstances plus probable cause.   And monitoring an individual through their clothing poses an extremely high likelihood that they will enter a place where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Cars get parked in a garages.   It happened here. "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " Yes, but a car that's parked in a garage does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to its location.

Dreeben", "text": " A general warrant-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --what motivated the Fourth Amendment historically was the disapproval, the outrage, that our Founding Fathers experienced with general warrants that permitted police indiscriminately to investigate just on the basis of suspicion, not probable cause and to invade every possession that the individual had in search of a crime.

This authorizes the ability to track somebody's movements in a car on a public roadway, a subject as to which this Court said in Knotts that no individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy because when they go out in their car their car is traveling on public roads.   Anyone can look.   The police have no obligation to avert their eyes from anything that any member of the public-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What if we -- I give you that, that it's in public.   Does the reasonable expectation of privacy trump that fact?   In other words, if we ask people, do you think it's -- it violates your right to privacy to have this kind of information acquired, and everybody says yes, is it a response that, no, that takes place in public, or it simply the reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the fact that it takes place in public? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --Well, something that takes place in public isn't inherently off limits to a reasonable expectation of privacy.   That's essentially the holding of Katz.   You go into a phone booth, you're in a public; making your calls within the phone booth is subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy.   But this Court, with full awareness of that holding, in Knotts and in Karo recognized that surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public roadways doesn't fit that description. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You can see, though, can't you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the police following you, you might get one answer, while today if you ask people does it violate your right to privacy to know that the police can have a record of every movement you made in the past month, they might see that differently?

Dreeben", "text": " They probably would also feel differently about being followed 24/7 by a team of FBI agents, who gain far more information than a GPS device produces.

Dreeben", "text": " --Justice Ginsburg, it's not very hard for police to follow somebody and find a traffic violation if they want to do that.   But to answer in part Justice Breyer's earlier concern about limiting principles, this Court recognized in the Whren decision that, although the Fourth Amendment is not a restriction on discriminatory or arbitrary or oppressive stops that are based on invidious characteristics, the Equal Protection Clause is.   The First Amendment also stands as a protection.   If this Court believes that there is an excessive chill created by an actual law or universal practice of monitoring people through GPS, there are other constitutional principles that are available.

And if I were to try to explain to someone, here is the Fourth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment says -- or it has been interpreted to mean that if I'm on a public bus and the police want to feel my luggage, that's a violation, and yet this kind of monitoring, installing the GPS and monitoring the person's movement whenever they are outside their house in the car is not?

The issue before us is not -- not in the abstract whether this police conduct is unreasonable.   The unreasonableness requirement or the unreasonableness prohibition does not take effect unless there has been a search.   And our cases have said that there is no search when -- when you are in public and where everything that you do is open to -- to the view of people.   That's the hard question in the case, not whether this is unreasonable.   That's not what the Fourth Amendment says, the police can't do anything that's unreasonable.   They can do a lot of stuff that's unreasonable without violating the Fourth Amendment and that -- the protection against that is the legislature.   But you have to establish, if you're going to go with Katz, that there has been an invasion of, of privacy when all that -- all that this is showing is where the car is going on the public streets, where the police could have had round-the-clock surveillance on this individual for a whole month or for 2 months or for 3 months, and that would not have violated anything, would it?

People nowadays understand that there are ways to monitor by way of a cell phone.   But I started my oral argument with this basic precept, Justice Alito.   This case does not require us to decide those issues of emerging technology.   It's a simple case at the core: Should the police be allowed surreptitiously to put these machines on people's cars and either -- call it a seizure, call it a search, call it a search and seizure, in the words of Katz, or call it a Fourth Amendment violation.

In this particular case, Antoine Jones had no idea whatsoever that his possessory interest in that property was about to be deprived by the government in a meaningful way to allow them to get information they couldn't have otherwise have gotten.   Justice Alito, what happens here, GPS produces unique data.   When you and I drive down the street, we don't emit GPS data.   What makes GPS data meaningful is the act -- is the use and placement of the GPS device, that was in this case, in this case, unconsented to by Antoine Jones unknowingly.

Technological advances can make the police more efficient at what they do through some of the examples that were discussed today: cameras, airplanes, beepers, GPS.   At the same time, technology and how it's used can change our expectations of privacy in the ways that Justice Alito was alluding to.   Today perhaps GPS can be portrayed as a 1984-type invasion, but as people use GPS in their lives and for other purposes, our expectations of privacy surrounding our location may also change.   For that-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Dreeben, that -- that seems too much to me.

There was a claim that it would have violated trade secret law for anybody else to do that.   And the Court accepted that and said tort law doesn't define the boundaries of the Fourth Amendment.

This Court said in Knotts that police efficiency has never been equated with police unconstitutionality.   The fact that GPS makes it more efficient for the police to put a tail on somebody invades no additional expectation of privacy that they otherwise would have had.
