[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case 12-1146, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. The Environmental Protection Agency and the consolidated cases.   Mr. Keisler. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The situation presented by this case is, to our knowledge, unprecedented in at least two respects.   First, EPA agrees that its interpretation of the PSD and Title V statutes is adopted, then applying other provisions of those same statutes would, according to their terms, would in EPA's words result in a program that would have been unrecognizable to the Congress that enacted it, and so contrary to Congress's intent that the Agency calls it absurd.   And second, EPA took that conclusion not as a reason to reexamine its interpretation, but as a basis for rewriting other provisions of the statutes that are clear and unambiguous, the numerical permitting thresholds that Congress enacted, because the Agency wrongly believes that fixes the problem.   And this is not a single one-time act of statutory rewriting, as problematic as that alone would be, because the Agency has said it intends to continually adjust and readjust thresholds into the indefinite future based on its ongoing assessment of the cost and benefits of regulation.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Keisler, I'm sorry.   Can I ask about your interpretation of the phrase \u201c any air pollutant \u201d?   Because there are a lot of different interpretations that have gone on among the various briefs and among the lower court opinions in this case.   So here are some choices, all right?   And I want really to ask you to pick what you're arguing for.   Your original position was that \u201c any air pollutant \u201d meant any NAAQS pollutant for which the area is in attainment; that was your original position.   Judge Kavanaugh's position is that it means any NAAQS pollutant.   There is another position that goes on in the briefs that says no, it doesn't mean any NAAQS pollutant; it means any local pollutant, whether or not it's a NAAQS pollutant; and there is still another position that says it's really any regulated pollutant other than greenhouse gases.   So those are four different interpretations that all of the folks on your side, and I realize there are a lot of them, have presented.   And I guess I'm asking you which one you're arguing for. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --Yes.   Your Honor, I'm here on behalf of all the private party Petitioners, and we have two arguments.   Our principal argument and the one I would like to focus on first is that while other programs of the Clean Air Act give EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources, PSD does not.   And that is because -- and this is where I would choose one of the options Your Honor gave me -- and that is because the PSD program is exclusively focused on emissions that have area-specific air quality impacts, and not on globally undifferentiated phenomena.   I wouldn't use the words-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " May I ask-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " When you say area-specific, I mean, I take it that these sort of ozone pollutants are not area-specific.   Would your interpretation exclude those as well? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --If the EPA couldn't make a regulatory finding that they had an area-specific air quality impact, yes.   Now, the sources-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Could I ask you a follow-up to Justice Kagan?   Now that's a fifth interpretation by your side.   That to me is the quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give deference to the Agency.   So if your side can't even come to one interpretation, why shouldn't we defer to the Agency? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --Well, first of all, Your Honor, the deference that an agency is afforded is always going to be limited to reasonable interpretations, and we would start out with the premise that an interpretation that requires the Agency to rewrite other provisions of the Act is not reasonable. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, it hasn't rewritten them.   All it has said, as I understand it, and I don't understand -- other than your view that there are too many people it's regulating, is that we can't implement it immediately, because it would overburden us administratively.   It hasn't said that over time, with streamlining and with other adjustments, that it can't do this.   It's just said we can't do it right away. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " That is right, Your Honor.   And that actually reflects a deeper problem, and I'd like to address that and then also explain our why our position we think is the correct and only correct interpretation of the statute on the broader question. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Before you do that, can you clarify whether or not you agree with the dissenting judges on the D.C. Circuit?   That is, if we limit it to criteria pollutants, even so, BACT must be installed for greenhouse gases.   You seemed in your main brief to agree with that.   You have a footnote saying it's got a heck of a lot of differences.   It's 86 percent of the emissions on the government's theory; 83 on yours.   But your reply brief seems to turn 180 degrees from that. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " And -- and let me sort that out.   And I recognize, Your Honor, that having six opening briefs isn't the most effective or most helpful way to the Court to present our position.   So let me express on behalf of all the private Petitioners, there are two arguments.   Our principal argument, and the one I would like to focus on the most, is that greenhouse gases are not included within the PSD program at all.   They can't trigger its applicability and they wouldn't be subject to the Best Available Control Technology determination. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, again, that's because they're not local. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Because they don't have area-specific air quality impacts, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, what do you make -- what do you make of the endangerment finding that greenhouse gases have severe effects at the local level that -- I think the endangerment finding is not before us today.   The endangerment finding is that they exacerbate ground-level ozone and smog. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Certainly, every effect that any environmental phenomenon has on the planet and on people will at some point be felt in some local area.   Our point is that that is not the kind of measurable area-specific, regionally-defined air quality impact that the PSD statute-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It's certainly not measurable.   The agency doesn't even assert that it's measurable, right. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --That's right.   And -- and maybe it would help if I specifically identified.   There are three features of the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I'm sorry.   Before you do that, we have an outstanding question from Justice Sotomayor.   Maybe-- "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.   The problem is not simply that the agency rewrote the thresholds and said that it will eventually try, as it did say, to get down to the level of the statutory thresholds, because the reason that Congress wrote those thresholds was because it wanted to exempt small entities from the costs and burdens of the permitting process.   And so when EPA says that it hopes eventually to get down to the apartment buildings and large high schools that would be covered if those thresholds were applied by carbon dioxide, it is contravening congressional intent in another way. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I didn't read them as saying that anyway.   I read them as saying they'll try to do it, but make whatever exemptions are necessary. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Well, and the problem is, Justice Scalia, that those exemptions violate the statute as well.   The exemptions they're talking about in order to deal with the small entities that Congress meant to exclude would be to have general permits by category.   And the statute specifically says that these determinations are to be case by case followed by an individualized hearing.   And so-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It -- it clearly is not a matter of the EPA simply saying we can't do it right away, but we're going to do it eventually. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It hasn't said that. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " It hasn't, and if they did say that they would be violating the statute in worse ways.   They would be treating a command by Congress not to regulate small entities into a command to regulate small entities. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Keisler, do you really mean to say that the only difference between greenhouse gases and the air pollutants that Congress clearly had in mind when it enacted the Clean Air Act is that greenhouse gases don't have a localized effect?   Isn't there also a big difference in that the quantity of greenhouse gases that are emitted by sources are much greater than the quantity of these other pollutants and that's why there's this discrepancy between the statutory threshold and the threshold that EPA has-- "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " --substituted? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " That's right, Your Honor.   And I think there are really two parallel problems that we're dealing with, each of which creates its own need for the EPA to violate the statute in order to save it for greenhouse gases.   One is the one that Your Honor and Justice Sotomayor were referring to, which is this was a statute designed for case-by-case permitting of a small number of large sources that materially contribute to the problem.   And whether you rewrite the thresholds or promise to regulate down to the infinitesimal level, you are violating that aspect of the statute.   But the other aspect of the statute, which is equally violated here, is the requirement that this particular program, not the other programs in the Act, but this particular program, be focused on these area-specific air quality impacts.   And there are three features, the three central features of the PSD statute, which we think show that.   The first is Section 7471, which is, I think, on page 13A of the appendix to the government's brief.   And that is the provision that specifies what the PSD program applies to and also explains what PSD, \u201c prevention of significant deterioration \u201d, refers to.   And 7471 says,   \"The program consists of emissions limitations and other measures as may be necessary to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in each region that bears certain designations. \"   And \u201c air quality in each region \u201d is Clean Air Act language for that subset of air pollution problems that have regionally-defined effects on the air that people breathe. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " How does the -- this differ?   I mean, there are many statutes, I believe, particularly in the regulatory area, where Congress passes a statute that tells the Agency, do A, B, C and D.   And then it turns out, since there's so many of the regulated things, that it just doesn't make sense to apply A, B and C and D to all of them.   So often I would think courts read in an exception where it makes no sense.   For example, if there were a statute that said you have to throw out all bubble gum that's been around for more than a month.   Well, what about bubble gum used in a display case that nobody ever intends to eat?   You see.   And so what we do all the time is we say, well, it doesn't mean to apply to that.   Now, why can't we take the same approach or EPA takes the same approach here?   It says 250 tons or more and we apply that all over the place, except it doesn't make sense here, so we read an exception into it, unwritten, for places where it makes no sense? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " I don't know that there actually is a precedent of this Court which says the agency can do precisely what it did here, which is take an express command that identifies thresholds, that didn't delegate to the agency the determination of the thresholds but says-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But I'm -- but I'm a little confused, because there have to be pollutants who -- where it doesn't emit just 250, where it emits a million.   And the Best Available Control Technology won't get it down to below 250.   Yet the PSD program is in effect when they get down below 250 on any pollutant of the six criteria.   So it can't be your view that this statute was written only to -- to get to measurable pollutants that -- that are at 250 or -- or can be brought below 250. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --Well, that's right, Your Honor.   It's not our position that the purpose of Best Available Control Technology is to bring facilities down to below the 250 level.   It's our position that the statute sets that 250 ton per year level as the trigger, that a facility which emits or has a potential to emit that or more is subject-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's a minimum, but anything-- "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --above it. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " That's right.   Anything above it. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " And then -- and then best available-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --And so GHG is something that's above that and it's never going to be brought down below it. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --That's right.   But it's above it for millions of entities that Congress intended to exempt from the permitting process.   And if I could just continue-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Right.   Well, let's go-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Keisler, if I could follow up, really, on Justice Breyer's question, because the conundrum here, you keep saying: Look, EPA is violating this specific statutory term.   But the conundrum that this cases raises is that everybody is violating a statutory term.   EPA is saying, no, we can't do the 100 to 250 with respect to greenhouse gases, but you are also violating a statutory term.   You know, it says any pollutant or it says in the other provision each pollutant subject to regulation.   Nobody would think that the most natural, most reasonable readings of those phrases are any pollutant if they have localized effects, but not otherwise.   So I mean, what's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable, and the agency has essentially picked one.   It said: Look, we're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants.   Instead, we're going to fudge the numbers.   And why isn't that the more reasonable of the two things to do? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --Because we don't agree, Your Honor, that those two -- that those two horns of the dilemma that Your Honor described are equally situated.   Certainly, 100 and 250 tons per year is a clear and unambiguous congressional command.   The question of how to interpret the phrase \u201c air pollutant \u201d is -- that is an issue that is subject to interpretation.   And if I could just then follow up-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I think I don't really understand.   But I mean, it's true that one is a number.   But the other, each pollutant subject to regulation or any air pollutant, what the EPA has done is for 30 years across presidential administrations treated those phrases as meaning a single thing, which I think if you put aside the absurdity problem in this case, everybody would agree is the most reasonable interpretation of those phrases.   And you're saying the EPA should junk that most reasonable interpretation of those phrases because there's a new kind of emitted -- emitted chemical or whatever that makes the numbers not work. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --No.   Let me -- it goes much beyond the numbers, Justice Kagan.   I think if anybody were looking at the PSD statute in isolation, without the benefit of Massachusetts v. EPA, assume that the word \u201c pollutant \u201d was an undefined term and the question was: What pollutants does this provision of the Clean Act refer to, they would conclude that it refers to pollutants only that have those area-specific air quality impacts.   And it's not only that the prevention of significant deterioration referred to in the statute is the deterioration of air quality in each region.   It is also two other features of that statute which we think make that unambiguously clear.   The first is Section 7475(e), which can be found on pages 27A to 29A, I think, of the government's statutory appendix.   And that mandates the one analysis that has to be conducted in every permitting process and the one analysis that Congress has required be available for public hearing, and that is an analysis of the air quality and local conditions at the site of the facility and each area that is going to be affected by the emissions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --Counsel, you began that discussion by saying putting Massachusetts v. EPA to one side.   But I was in the dissent in that case, but we still can't do that. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " No, that's--   [Laughter]   That's -- that's right, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And -- and my question is along that exact same line.   Let's assume, and it's the case, that we're bound by both the result and the reasoning of Massachusetts and EPA and the -- the American Electric v. Connecticut case.   Under your view, what regulatory force, what regulatory significance, do those cases have under, A, your approach and, B, the approach by the Chamber of Commerce in the blue brief?   I -- I think that may be consistent with the subject the Chief Justice just opened. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Sure.   Let me begin with Massachusetts v. EPA and then I'll turn to AEP v. Connecticut.   Massachusetts v. EPA did not hold that the interpretation of pollutant in that opinion had to be applied every time the word \u201c pollutant \u201d appears in the Clean Air Act.   The same day that Massachusetts came out, this Court decided Environmental Defense v. Duke, in which it specifically said that, even when a defined term in the statutory definition provision is construed a particular way, that doesn't mean that that same term used elsewhere in the statute can't be construed differently where context requires.   And the Court reversed the Fourth Circuit for holding that they had to be the same.   And that's why in Massachusetts, after indeed holding that the definition of \u201c pollutant \u201d unambiguously in its literal sense included greenhouse gases, the Court didn't stop there.   It went on to ask whether applying that definition to the Title II provisions on motor vehicles that were at issue in that case would produce what the Court called \u201c extreme measures or counterintuitive results \u201d.   And only after finding that there'd be no extreme or counterintuitive results did the Court direct the EPA to apply that definition to those Title II provisions.   And I think what that reflected was that the Court understood that the literal definition of \u201c pollutant \u201d was sufficiently broad that it shouldn't be mechanically applied, plugged in everywhere in the Act that the word \u201c pollutant \u201d appears, without some additional analysis of the context of those provisions. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What else does it cover other than Title II, other than mobile vehicles? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " There are multiple places in which the word \u201c pollutant \u201d appears in the Act in which the EPA has understood Mass v. EPA the way I just described, in which they have interpreted the words \u201c any air pollutant \u201d to mean only a subset of the pollutants that -- that the definition literally could be held to encompass. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --That's generally because the section that it's in gives a different definition directly. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " No, that's -- with respect, Your Honor, that's not correct.   So, for example, in the PSD in Title V provisions, it says \u201c any air pollutant \u201d.   The EPA has interpreted that to mean any regulated air pollutant, not because of any separate definition, but because of context. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You are right, but-- "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " The context suggests otherwise.   The same thing with the provision on visibility-impairing pollutants. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But your -- your answer is that they can be treated differently under different parts of the Act.   Doesn't that contradict your earlier view that we can't change the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " No, I don't think so, Your Honor, because it was an act of interpretation in Massachusetts v. EPA of a particular term, and the question is, reading that decision as a whole, what import did the Court give that interpretation.   It would not have needed to go on and say, let's look at specifically the Title II provisions at issue here and ask whether it will produce extreme or counterintuitive measures if it weren't the case that that was an additional part of the inquiry that was necessary. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And what other programs I asked earlier.   So we have the mobile vehicles.   What else?   You say it excludes PSD.   What else does it-- "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " I think most critically, Your Honor, it includes the new source performance standards program of Section 111 that this Court discussed in Connecticut v. AEP.   And this is a very important point, because this case is not about whether EPA can regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources.   This Court held that it could under this program in Section 11.   This is about whether State and local permitting authorities, the 90-plus State and local permitting authorities, are supposed to regulate plant by plant under this particular PSD program.   And I mention the NSPS program because the features of that program highlight what's wrong here because the NSPS program doesn't contain the elements of the PSD program that require the PSD program to be rewritten in so many particulars to make greenhouse gases fit.   NSPS doesn't have the 100 and 250-ton per year thresholds.   It lets EPA by notice and comment rulemaking decide what category of sources are most contributing to the problem and most require regulation.   It doesn't require the area-specific local impact analysis of subsection (e) of 7475, which EPA has told State and local permitting authorities, even though it's mandatory, don't conduct it because it can't be done for greenhouse gases.   NSPS permits the EPA to look at reducing the national footprint without regard to area-specific impacts and it permits the EPA to do this through a national uniform emissions standard that the plants can then determine how best to meet, rather than asking 90 State and local permitting authorities, which is what PSD is about, to decide plant by plant what they think each plant in their jurisdiction should do about global warming. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So in your opinion -- is -- I'm not sure what the statutory cite is to the provision you are talking about.   Is it 7411? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " That's right, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   So you're saying they could use 7411(a) and (b) to get to just the same place they are today. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Yes, without-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You don't see an objection.   There must be some reason they didn't do that. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --Well, they are doing it, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " They are doing it?   Well, then I don't know what this case is about.   I mean, it's a question of whether they do exactly the same thing under one provision or another provision.   You agree with them that they could do it under the other one and we'd end up at exactly the same place. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " But it's not exactly the same thing, Your Honor.   And it is the difference between having the EPA, through notice and comment rulemaking, establish a national emissions standards and then the plants can deal with that incentive system in the best way they can and figure out how to meet it, versus this command and control PSD mechanism, where 90-plus State and local permitting authorities are each having to decide on their own what controls they think each plant in their area should engage in in order to deal with global warming.   It makes perfect sense to have 90 State and local permitting authorities addressing the area-specific air quality impacts of plants that are built in their States. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It says   \"such standards with such modifications as he deems appropriate. \"   That's the language of 7411(b). "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   So if this is the right program, why couldn't they copy it word for word into the rules and just put a different section number at the bottom?   I know you'd have a preferred way to do it, but if they disagreed with you and they think this is the perfect program, why can't they do it? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Because the statutory language and structure of the PSD program does not, we think, encompass these kinds of pollutants that have globally dispersed results and not area-specific impacts.   And it's for the reasons that I've indicated.   7411, which says -- sorry.   7471, which says that the prevention of significant deterioration is focused on deterioration of air quality in each region; the study required by 7475(e), which is of local conditions; and the fact that this is assigned to 90 State and local permitting authorities. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Is that your second point?   I've been keeping a list here of points you -- you have not been permitted to get to.   [Laughter]   One, you were going to discuss not just the Massachusetts case, but the follow-on case to Massachusetts. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Oh, well, Connecticut. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You never did that, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " Well, Connecticut v. AEP, and the only point to make about that is that that was the case which held that the commission -- that the EPA has authority under Section 111, the NSPS provision, to address greenhouse gases without having to rewrite thresholds by designating the categories of sources like it's trying to do here.   But it has to do it by national emissions standards through notice and comment rulemaking.   Connecticut v. AEP certainly did not approve -- the PSD provisions here -- certainly did not approve the regulations rewriting the statutory thresholds that the EPA had to -- had to promulgate in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " The other thing -- you were going to give two points and you only got to -- what is it -- 7411(e), but there was another point. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " There were really -- yes, there were three features I mentioned of the PSD statute which we think make the context clear.

Keisler", "text": " The second was that study, the only required study is of local conditions and area-specific impacts.   And the third is just that this is assigned to 90 State and local permitting authorities, which is -- it is not plausible to think that with respect, not to these area-specific impacts, but to a global problem like global warming that what Congress was doing was saying we think 90 State and local permitting authorities should make those decisions rather than, perhaps, EPA on a national basis. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --You -- just to be clear, your reading would say that the -- that the Agency was not permitted, with notice and opportunity to be heard, to say -- to make a criteria -- make this a criteria of pollution in NAAQS. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " If the Agency had tried to establish a NAAQS for greenhouse gases, we think that would be contrary to the statute because the National Ambient Air Quality Standards are all about regional concentrations.   Is this area in or out of compliance?   If the gas goes up to the atmosphere and is mixed there, either the whole country is going to be in attainment or the whole country is going to be out of attainment.   It doesn't work at all with the NAAQS structure.   And if I could reserve the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, why don't you take an extra 5 minutes, and -- and you can begin by answering the question: You know, the government disaggregates the discussion, and their first point in their brief is that greenhouse gases can be regulated with respect to sources that are already covered by the PSD program.   That position does not implicate your concern about the broad reach of EPA regulation, does it? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --I think it does, Your Honor, because while that might deal with the specific issue of rewriting the thresholds, the fact that the PSD provisions for the reasons I have indicated is limited to area-specific air impacts would we think be violated merely by applying best available control technology to a globally disbursed substance like greenhouse gases. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I understand.   But they would only be applying that with respect to sources that are already required to operate under PSD permits. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " That's right, but they would be applying it to a substance, greenhouse gases, which the PSD program was not designed to address, which was designed to be addressed by other programs.   And I would say, Your Honor, that while they have tried to separate those issues out, that there's one issue about who has to get a permit and the other issue about whether the requirements of best available control technology apply, the regulation that they have adopted to implement what they call their tailoring rule applies equally to both.   What they've done is say that the words \u201c subject to regulation \u201d, which are the words in the BACT provision, shall only apply to greenhouse gases, even when they are regulated, if you're emitting them at levels of 100,000 tons per year or more.   When they did that they both rewrote the provision that says who has to get a permit and they rewrote the provision that says what best available control technology applies.

But that has had virtually no practical effect because all of those other pollutants, if they are emitted in threshold quantities, invariably -- we've been able to find about two or three exceptions over 30 years -- invariably the facility that is emitting them is also emitting 250 tons per year of one of the criteria pollutants.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   General Mitchell. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan F. Mitchell", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:   There of are at least two issues in this case in which EPA and the Petitioners agree.   The first is that the term \u201c air pollutant \u201d cannot be given uniform construction after the Clean Air Act even after this Court's ruling in Massachusetts that \u201c air pollutant \u201d includes all things airborne for purposes of Title 2.   The second point of agreement is that greenhouse gases cannot be treated the same as other air pollutants for purposes of the PSD and Title 5 programs, because the unambiguous statutory requirements of those programs are incompatible with sensible regulation of greenhouse gases.   EPA thinks it can fix this problem by imposing an atextual agency-created regime that applies only to greenhouse gases.   The proper response, however, is for EPA to conclude that Congress never delegated regulatory authority over greenhouse gases in the PSD and Title 5 programs.   Congress does not establish round holes for square pegs, and Brown & Williamson holds in these situations agency cannot make a round hole square by rewriting unambiguous statutory language. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " General, I take it that the unambiguous statutory language that you are referring to is the references to 100 and to 250.   And it seems to me that that's an odd kind of term to drive such an important statutory interpretation question, because what those numbers were all about is that they were supposed to separate major emitters from minor emitters.   I mean, they were supposed to be about the size of the facility.   They were not supposed to have -- they were not supposed to make any distinctions as to the type of pollutant.   So you're essentially using those numbers to make distinctions as to the type of pollutant rather than, it seems to me and more sensible approach would be to say, look, the 100 and 250 numbers don't work for this new kind of pollutant, we're going to up the numbers, and that will be the rest of the statute and all the purposes of Congress intact. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan F. Mitchell", "text": " Justice Kagan, the reason we don't think the approach that you describe is permissible is because there are statutory provisions in the Clean Air Act that specifically forbid EPA to do what Your Honor is prescribing.   7661(a)(A) says that EPA cannot under any circumstance exempt any major source from the Title 5 requirements.   And because that provision is in the statute, EPA cannot be claiming to seize discretion when Congress has specifically withheld that type of discretion here.   This is akin to a dispensing power, for EPA to be coming in and rewriting the Title 5 permitting thresholds in the way that they are.   And the question to ask is whether the term \u201c air pollutant \u201d is flexible enough to accommodate different meanings in different statutory contexts.   And here even EPA agrees with us that \u201c air pollutant \u201d can mean different things in different parts of the Act, even Massachusetts.   Massachusetts held that \u201c air pollutant \u201d unambiguously includes all things airborne, all airborne compounds of whatever stripe for purposes of Title 2.   But EPA has refused to carry over that definition throughout the Clean Air Act when the term \u201c air pollutant \u201d appears in at least three different places.   One of them is section 7411(a)(4), which is part of the NSPS program.   In that provision the term \u201c air pollutant \u201d appears as part of the definition of modification.   EPA does not interpret that to mean all things airborne.   It doesn't even interpret it to mean all regulated air pollutants.   It interprets that to mean air pollutants for which a standard of performance has been established.   In the PSD and Title 5 permitting thresholds, EPA interprets the phrase \u201c any air pollutant \u201d not to mean all things airborne, but to mean any regulated air pollutant.   And then finally, in Section 7491 EPA interprets the phrase \u201c any pollutant \u201d to mean any visibility-impairing pollutant.   So if Massachusetts's all things airborne view of the phase \u201c air pollutant \u201d is forced to be applied to every provision of the Clean Air Act where the word \u201c air pollutant \u201d appears, all of these longstanding EPA interpretations would have to be discarded. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, General, if you think about the question of what any pollutant means, and you put aside this whole absurdity question that the numbers get you to, you just say, what does any air pollutant mean?   Does it mean what EPA has said it has meant for 30 years, which is any pollutant that's regulated under this Act, or does it mean something more along the lines of what you're saying, which is anything other than greenhouse gases or anything other than pollutants that have particular localized effects.   You would obviously choose EPA's version of the thing.   And the only reason that you're not choosing that is because of these numbers that are in the statute, which were designed only, only to distinguish between major and minor emitters.   So if you can distinguish between major and minor emitters while keeping the completely sensible longstanding interpretation of any pollutant, why wouldn't you do that? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan F. Mitchell", "text": " Because I don't think it can be said, Justice Kagan, that the phrase \u201c any air pollutant \u201d unambiguously means any regulated pollutant.

So you say we've got to do something about this statute because they don't really mean to every football game they're going to have a permit, or it doesn't mean every 500 people, like all of my relatives are together, they have to have a permit.   No, it can't mean that.   So we have two choices.   Choice A, which is what you would like, is it means any air pollutant, any regulated air pollutant, but not greenhouse gases.   Okay.   That's choice one.   Choice two is it means any air pollutant including greenhouse gases, but implicitly EPA has the authority to exempt small emitters.   You see?

It's permissible for an agency to construe ambiguous statutory language to avoid absurdity.   In fact, it must construe the ambiguous language to avoid absurdity before taking choice two that Your Honor described, where it rewrites unambiguous statutory language to avoid absurdity.   If the simple choice were between construing one unambiguous statutory provision to avoid the anomalous results and construing another unambiguous statutory provision to avoid that outcome, then EPA would have a much stronger case for deference here.

But if you had been sitting in Congress and the Senate, Mr. Billings, I think, is the staff person, Senator Muskie, and suppose that you had this choice put to you with your language.   We'd either like to have the authority implicit here to exempt the football team, the tiny emitters, or we'd like it not to cover it at all.   Which do you think the Senate would have chosen in enacting this bill from the evidence in the language itself, in the evidence which I look at, the history of the bill? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan F.

That's why they're not willing to impose it on every entity that emits more than 100 tons per year of carbon dioxide.

And it's plausible to impose those burdens, perhaps, on large industrial sources, but certainly not to impose that on the corner deli or -- or the Chinese restaurant of a high school building.   So, again, to return to Justice Breyer's question, which would Congress have chosen, the choice was made in the statute to establish rigid numerical permitting thresholds that were defined not only by 100 tons and 250 tons per year, but also defined by a specific metric.   And to withhold from the Agency the discretion to depart from those unambiguous requirements, instead, they provided looseness to the extent they provided it in the definition of air pollutant, which even though this Court held in Massachusetts unambiguously includes all things airborne, for purposes of Title II, EPA has narrowed that construction in numerous other parts of the statute.

Yet Petitioners say EPA lacks any authority to use the PSD permitting program to regulate the same emissions, from the same sources, causing the same harms.   That's not a reasonable reading of statutory text, and it rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the PSD program and the way it is supposed to operate in conjunction with the-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Why?   Why would it be unreasonable to give -- give EPA authority to regulate mobile sources and not authority to -- to regulate stationary sources, given that stationary sources have to be licensed in this fashion and it -- it produces all sorts of other problems?

Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " --Well, the Court said, I think, that it was plain that Congress gave EPA the authority to regulate stationary sources in the American Electric Power case under Section 7411, and that I think gets to a fundamental premise where the Petitioners are just wrong.   Section 7411 -- and this relates to a question you asked, Justice Breyer -- Section 7411 and the PSD program are not aimed at different problems.   They are aimed at the same problem, and you can see that from the statutory text.   For example, if one looks at section 7475(a)(3), which you can find at page 21A of our appendix, you will see that in order to become eligible for a PSD permit if you are a major emitting facility, you've got to -- if you are looking at subsection (3), under (3)(A) and (3)(B), you've got to show that you can meet all of the local air quality requirements of the NAAQS, those standards; and then (C) says you've got to meet any other applicable emissions standard or standard of performance under this chapter.   And that standard of performance language is not an accident.   In 7411 the standards that are set, the nationwide standards that Mr. Keisler was discussing for greenhouse gases or other air pollutants, are called standards of performance.   So it's specifically picking up the Section 7411 standard.   Then if one turns to the definition of Best Available Control Technology under the PSD program, which you can find at page 34A of the appendix to our brief, you will notice that Congress specifically linked the operation of the Section 7411 standards and the Best Available Control Technology under the PSD program.   And what this provision says, I won't belabor you by reading the lengthy provision, but what it says is that once Congress has set a standard under section 7411, a nationwide standard, that becomes a floor for the evaluation of Best Available Control Technology.

But if I could just finish off this point about the connection between the operation of the two, because I do think it's of critical importance here.   That what you are supposed to do under BACT is use Best Available Control Technology to get above the floor, that the NSPS program sets those standards on an every 8-year basis, and the point of BACT is to force best practices to keep raising the bar during those 8-year intervals.   And there is an additional point to be made about the relationship between the two.   This goes back to Senator Muskie in 1977.   The NSPS program was enacted as part of the 1970 Act.   The PSD program was added in 1977; and it was added in 1977 because of dissatisfaction over both the pace and the comprehensiveness of the -- of air pollutant regulations that were being enacted by EPA under the 7411 standard; and it's because under 7411 EPA has got to go one source category at a time.   It has got to do power plants; then it's got to do refineries; then it's got to do the next thing and the next thing and the next thing.   And so EPA hadn't gotten standards in place for all the different sources, and the point of -- of the PSD program is to put in place an additional requirement.   It's exactly what Congress was after.   So that when there is a standard under 7411 that becomes the floor, and you -- and BACT says let's keep raising the bar.   But when there isn't a standard under 7411 PSD is supposed to fill the breach, and it makes sense because you want to get -- the PSD program, remember, applies to -- excuse me -- it applies to new construction or major modification.

And the goal of the transition is not to gradually expand the permitting requirement until they've got all the Dunkin' Donuts in America under it.   That's not what's going on.   In fact, it's the opposite.   What they're saying is, they're taking a look at the standards they used to decide who's eligible for a permit.

But, you know, and I understand that EPA may have felt like, oh, gosh, can we really do that?

I mean, is this a particular assertion of authority only with respect to greenhouse gases or does it cover any pollutant under the Act VERRI: Well, if you're -- if you're going to use the NAAQS approach and designate it as a NAAQ, as a NAAQS pollutant and pollutants, and that wouldinclude this standard.

The issue is whether you can read in exceptions unnecessarily when the absurdity in question doesn't flow inevitably from the statute, when the statute can be interpreted another way that would not produce the absurdity.   Aren't you compelled where there is ambiguity to adopt the interpretation of the statute that does not produce absurdity rather than adopting the interpretation that produces absurdity and then going around altering the provisions of the contract -- of the statute?   I mean, to take Justice Breyer's bubble gum example, yes, I suppose it -- would you have to make an exception for bubble gum in the display window if the statute were subject to two interpretations, one of which would include display windows, and the other one of which wouldn't.   It seems to me of course you would have to adopt the interpretation that didn't include display windows.   And that's what is going on here.   There's -- there's -- yes, there's absurdity but the issue is how is that absurdity to be taken account of?   By simply letting EPA rewrite the very clear numbers in the statute, or else by adopting a permissible interpretation of the statute that does not lead to that absurdity.   And I think that's quite a different question from -- from what we've been discussing. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " --Two points about that, if I could.   First, that goes to the question of what triggers the permit application.   It's only the expansion of the number of permit applicants that even raises this question of the so-called absurdity.   It doesn't go to the -- to the argument -- the Petitioners are making a far more substantial argument, that EPA lacks any authority to consider greenhouse gas emission under the BACT provision and other provisions, even for sources that have a permit for their emissions of non-greenhouse gases.   So it only goes to the question of the scope of the triggering provision, not to EPA's authority to use PSD to regulate great greenhouse gases for entities that are already subject to the permit for other reasons.   Now, with respect to the trigger, what I would say about that, Justice Scalia, is that the statutory language is \u201c any air pollutant \u201d.   Reading Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA came to the conclusion that that language necessarily encompasses greenhouse gas emissions.   That conclusion is most consistent with the EPA's statutory obligations here, because if the choice -- and you can say the choice is between doing something sensible and absurd results.

There have to be plausible alternative interpretations of the statute.   And reading the phrase \u201c any pollutant \u201d to mean any pollutant except for greenhouse gases for reasons that have nothing to do with the purposes of the statute is not a plausible alternative interpretation.   Wouldn't that be the argument? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Yes, that's exactly the argument, and I think that's exactly what EPA did when it reads Massachusetts v. EPA and its understanding of air pollutant and thought about that in the context of the regulatory goals of this program.

And the other is -- I mean, this is quite -- I see -- I've got it focused now.   It seems to me in my mind that we have two questions, and I think they were well stated by Justice Scalia actually.   The first is, what is the alternative interpretation that doesn't apply it here?   And that would be an interpretation that doesn't put greenhouse gases within this PSD provision at all.   And that might be really unthinkable -- no, not unthinkable, but have worse consequences than worrying about the interpretation of this trigger provision.   So either we have to do the one or the other.   Either we have to interpret the trigger provision with flexibility so that there are written exceptions -- unwritten exceptions in it, one way or the other, or we have to say you can't do that, and therefore they don't apply to all.

And the questions about whether the PSD program is limited entirely to pollutants that affect local ambient air quality, I just don't think that adds up at the end of the day.   For one thing, EPA has been regulating since 1998 under the PDS program something called ozone-depleting substances.   We talked about this a little bit in our brief.   Those are substances that have no local effects; they -- they are substances that are released; they go up into the stratosphere; and they eat up the ozone and that then creates additional ultraviolet rays which cause cancer and cataracts.

They created a new Title VI for ozone-depleting substances, so they were clearly focused on it.   And they did not pull ozone-depleting substances out of the PSD program at that time.

And so that if the Court were to say that \u201c any air pollutant \u201d can't be interpreted in the way that EPA has interpreted it at the trigger level, to mean what we think it says, and what Massachusetts v. EPA compelled, but if the Court disagrees with that, it seems to me the -- the answer that is least problematic from EPA's point of view does the -- is the least dissonant and the least -- causes the least risk of collateral consequences with respect to established regulatory programs, which go beyond NAAQS pollutants under PSD, would be to say that you can't read any air pollutant to include CO2, because the inclusion of CO2 generates a permitting obligation that is out of accord with what Congress would have expected.

We think that the -- I just don't see, given that BACT says in unambiguous terms in Section 7475(a)(4) that anybody who's subject to a permit has got to meet BACT for each pollutant subject to regulation under the chapter, meaning the Act.   I just don't see how you can get out from under that-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You've got to follow -- you've got to follow the plain text of the statute there.

That's what (c)(3) says.   And so between (c)(3) and BACT, greenhouse gas -- assuming that EPA acts under 7411, those, it seems to me, have to be in.

Is that going to be the same under the reading that you are proposing? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Pretty close.   But I think -- but I think the reason that we would -- the reason that the exclusion of CO2 seems to me to be the least problematic is that EPA does have an established regulatory framework here that applies not just to NAAQS pollutants, but to the other non-NAAQS pollutants, sulfuric acid mist and the other things that EPA regulates under the PSD program.   And you wouldn't be redefining the trigger to exclude those things which have previously been included.   That's, I think, the -- the rifle shot solution, to the extent that the Court thinks it's a problem.

Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Yes, certainly that's right.   Certainly, that's right.   But I think the -- the argument that, as I -- as I read Judge Kavanaugh's opinion and as I understood my friend's argument on behalf of the ACC, was that the statute essentially compelled the conclusion that you had to pick one or the other of those alternative readings in order to avoid expanding the permitting obligation.   And the problem with that way of thinking about it is that there are many other pollutants, non-NAAQS pollutants that EPA has regulated for years and used as a trigger for years to require PSD permits, which you would be at risk of excluding from the program if you were to adopt the ACC or the Judge Kavanaugh reading as triggers, and that's a problem that, it seems to me, the Court ought to be thinking about trying to avoid.

Kennedy", "text": " I have to say in reading the brief for the States and reading your brief, I -- I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position.

It was cited and relied upon by the EPA in the rulemaking proceedings and rulemaking opinions.   So if I could just sum up here.   The EPA did what it did because the problem it's confronting is a problem that EPA considers to be urgent. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " General, I don't want to interrupt your summation, but on the -- let mejust ask this quick question.   On the issue of what happens with a facility that is subject to the PSD program because of the emission of other pollutants, the Petitioners argue that the permitting process would be entirely different for greenhouse gases because it would make no sense to require monitoring of local air conditions and -- air conditions.   It would make no sense to try to assess the effect of the emission of the greenhouse gases on the area in the region.   Could you just give a quick response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " You know, I'm glad you raised that, Justice Alito.   That's actually quite important.   That's just not right.   I mean, if you think about it in multiple ways, there are multiple pollutants that are currently regulated under the PSD program.   Some of them have National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and the local testing makes sense for those.   Others don't have National Air Quality -- Ambient Air Quality Standards, like sulfuric acid mists, for example, and others.   There aren't standards for those.   And the way EPA has handled that is they look at the regulations.   The regulation says in terms of the monitoring that the statute requires, there's a specific exemption for substances that are otherwise regulated but for which there is no NAAQS or related standard.   So they're just exempt from the monitoring requirement.   There's also an analysis requirement.   And what EPA has said and what the States do in their permitting processes with respect to the analysis requirement for the non-NAAQS substances, for example, sulfuric acid mists, is to apply a very simple idea.   You're not trying in that situation to make sure that the particular emissions aren't having -- are consistent with the overall ambient air quality level.   It's a very simple calculus.   More is worse; less is better.   And so with respect to things like sulfuric acid mist, with respect to things like ozone-depleting substances, that is how it has always worked at the State level under the PSD program.   You just -- you look at what the BACT emissions levels.   You try to get them down.   And so you're not treating greenhouse gases any differently than sulfuric acid mists or ozone-depleting substances or the others that don't have those requirements.   And then in terms of localized effects versus wider effects, I mean, I would just remind the Court about the EMC-Homer City case from just a few months ago -- it's not at all unusual that the EPA would be regulating emissions in one place because they -- they impose effects hundreds or even thousands of miles away.   The pollutants emitted in Ohio or Kentucky contribute to the air pollution levels in New Haven or Bangor, Maine.   That's what that case was all about.   And so -- and you regulate those pollutants also through the PSD program.   And so don't -- you aren't in that situation looking just to see what happens in the local area.   It's just never been the nature of this program.   It's not -- it just doesn't work that way.   And if I could just remind the Court, in conclusion, why EPA did what it did, it is because this is an urgent problem.   Every year that passes, this problem gets worse, and the threat to future generations get worse.   And I think, faced with the obligations that EPA had, it made the most reasonable choice available to it.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, you've got five extra minutes, to be -- to be fair.   And one thing-- "}, {"speaker": "Donald B.

You had asked the Solicitor General what would BACT involve in this kind of situation.   And I think Your Honor gave a perhaps absurd hypothetical about light bulbs.   Your Honor should know that EPA's instruction to the State and local permitting authorities does address light bulbs in the cafeteria.   What it says is that State and local permitting authorities likely -- likely do not need to look at whether more efficient light bulbs should be used in a plant's cafeteria because that would be worth the burden in terms of the payoff.   But the fact that they are talking about it in that level of detail brings it into sharp relief when applied to which GS which is not about adding technology to control the stuff that comes out of smoke stacks is pervasive of an industrial plant's operation and asking the 90 State and local permits authorities to decide what needs to be done and that's what is so different between this and the NSPS program which functions by setting emissions standards. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what do I do with the examples in the brief of the 144 permits that have already been given, people who have managed to come into compliance under that? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " It's certainly not our submission that every single determination by every one of these authorities is going to be unreasonable or outrageous or is going to reach into the cafeterias.   But it is the scope of this is so different in nature and kind than the NSPS program, which would set efficient standards that people would be able to meet.   And the second point I would like to make, Your Honor, is there is a selectivity what the agency considers ambiguous and unambiguous.   It unambiguously is required to apply Massachusetts' definition of \u201c pollutant \u201d, but \u201c any air pollutant \u201d is ambiguous enough to accommodate any regulated air pollutant.   But 100 and 250 tons per year, that's really ambiguous because it can mean 100,000.   And I mention that because the selectiveness with which EPA has turned the ambiguity on and off so that in combination it maximizes the agency's discretion shows that when we talk about what is -- what does the least violence to the statute, we have to think about it, among other things, along the parameter of separation of powers and whether the way in which the agency has perceived it here has arrogated an exceptional and troubling degree of discretion to design its own climate change program.   And finally with respect to the different definitions of pollutant, we have proceeded here as if we are defining that particular word in the statute but here is another way to think about the interpretative exercise here and that is Brown & Williamson.   Brown & Williamson started with the assumption that the encompassed nicotine and cigarettes but then it went on to say that giving the FDA jurisdiction under those programs under tobacco would be inconsistent with the regulatory structure.   When it did that it didn't go back to those definition and say we have to figure out which word in that definition means something different than what we originally assumed.   It says that the interruption as a whole conflicted with the statute as a whole and that was sufficient.   We think the same is true here.   If the Court has no further questions, I thank the Court.
