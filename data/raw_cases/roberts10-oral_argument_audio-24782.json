[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1094, Nutraceutical Corporation versus Lambert. Mr. Hueston. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the proceedings below, Respondent filed his Rule 23(f) petition months late, and Nutraceutical timely objected.   Although this Court has held that mandatory claim processing rules are unalterable when properly invoked, the Ninth Circuit in this case created broad and unprecedented equitable exceptions to excuse Lambert's late filing. Critically, in this case, this Court has twice considered language in a federal rule that is virtually identical to the federal rules at issue in this case.   And in both those cases, in the Carlisle and the Robinson cases, this Court rejected equitable exceptions, even when faced with facts far more empathetic than those presented here. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Counsel, I thought that both sides agreed that if the motion for reconsideration is filed within 14 days, within that period, then there is tolling until the motion is decided.   Is that -- is that so? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And isn't that a form of equitable tolling? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " It is not a form of equitable tolling, Your Honor.   Instead, as held by this Court in U.S. v. Dieter, it's based on a traditional and virtually unquestioned practice that is premised upon three main policy points: to prevent premature appeals, to develop and strengthen the record, and to respect the authority of the district court. It's important to realize that this doctrine could not open the door to equitable exceptions for claim processing rules because, in the Ibarra, Dieter, and Healy cases, those dealt with a statute, 3731, establishing the deadline in a criminal case, and, thus, it was a jurisdictional case.   So the application of that rule in the context of a criminal case with jurisdictional rules, in fact, tolled those jurisdictional deadlines.   And so, therefore, pursuant to the Court's holdings in Hamer and elsewhere, that is not an equitable exception. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Hueston, given the reasons that you just stated for that rule, why is the rule limited to a motion for reconsideration that's filed during the 14-day window? In other words, suppose the motion for reconsideration was filed in a timely manner for such a motion but after the 14-day period. Why wouldn't the same reasons apply? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Because, Your Honor, if that reasoning applied, in this instance, for instance, there was actually no deadline for filing of a motion for reconsideration in the Central District of California, but let's assume for purposes of your question we had a 30-day deadline. If that 30-day deadline were imposed in this case and one could file on the 30th day and begin tolling, that would render the 14-day deliberately small window that the advisory committee drafters created in order to minimize the disruption and delay in the context of class action cases a nullity because, in any instance where you would have a longer deadline for a motion for reconsideration, you could wait out that period and avoid the window that was intentionally created by the drafters. And I would like to direct the Court's attention specifically to the advisory committee notes to the 1998 amendment to Rule 23(f), where they specifically stated the importance of the short window to deliberately keep the time as short as possible. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It just seems as though the -- the exception that you admit, which is the exception for filing a motion for reconsideration within the 14-day period, also effectively renders that 14-day period a nullity, right, because it stops it in its tracks and then, once the motion for reconsideration has been dealt with, as I understand the agreement between the parties, the -- the clock goes all the way back to the beginning. So given that -- that what you -- the exception you admit renders the 14-day period a nullity, again, I just wonder why the exact same reasons, practices, traditions don't suggest that, for example, as in -- as -- as what -- the example you gave, if the motion for reconsideration is timely filed within 30 days, that as long as you do that, it should have the same effect. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Justice Kagan, there is no doubt that if the motion for reconsideration is filed, for instance, on the 14th day, there would then be a longer period of time.   But we must presume that the advisory committee considered that. And as I have thought about the timing, the 14 days creates a shorter window at which then is hooked the potentially later motion for reconsideration period. If we apply Lambert's rule and extend that out to 30 days or potentially longer, and in the Central District no deadline at all, it truly renders the 14-day period a nullity in that instance. Your Honors, I would like to direct your attention particularly to the Carlisle case.   That case involved very similar language in former Criminal Rule 45(b).   And in that instance, the trial court was faced in a situation where there was a motion for judgment of acquittal and the trial judge found legal innocence. And the judge granted additional time. The petition was filed just one day late.   The trial judge found that it was appropriate to grant an extension for just a single day because a grave injustice would occur. And yet, faced with legal innocence and excusable neglect, this Court looked at the language of former federal Criminal Rule 45(b), which has virtually identical language to Appellate Rule 26(b), which is applicable in this case; namely, \"The Court may not enlarge\" -- sorry -- \"The Court may not extend the time for the filing.\" "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " On that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What happens if there's -- what happens if Hurricane Katrina comes along and no one can reach the courthouse?

In that instance -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " In other words, if Hurricane Katrina comes along and all the courthouses are shut, nobody can get there, everybody loses their motion? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, in this instance, when you have with Rule 26(f) the emphatic language without the harsh consequences at issue that you do in Carlisle and others, then, if the deadline cannot be abided by within the 14 days, then the opportunity to pursue the petition for permission for interlocutory appeal is lost. Now that may seem like a harsh consequence -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, didn't the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm not saying harsh consequence.

What was it -- but I think it was along the same line.   What -- what -- what happens in all these things where that courthouse burns down, lightning strikes, Hurricane Katrina? You see the point? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " In your opinion, does everybody -- and, you know, there are dozens of motions pending.   Some fall within these.   Some don't.   Anyone with a motion that falls within this language, bad luck, you lose.   Is that what it is? Even though it isn't a jurisdictional rule, it's -- is that -- is that your position? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " It is our position within this context of a mandatory claim processing rule in the emphatic language that is present here, more so than even in the Carlisle and Robinson cases. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Isn't there -- I -- I may be misremembering this, but isn't there a provision that extends the filing period when the courthouse is closed? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, there is an exception for accessibility of the courthouse that would apply in that situation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Now that doesn't help you with intervening periods, I gather that would not toll in that sense, but if the due date is a date on which the court is inaccessible or formally closed, that would get at least that relief? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   And the key point here, I believe, is that it is properly within the province of the rule drafters to consider when and in what circumstances the court should have discretion. And here, at both Rule 26(b), and then, to distinguish this as an even stronger example of emphatic language, in Rule 2 in both -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, before we leave -- before we leave 26(b), there is a bit of a complication, right? It says that we can extend time or permit an act to be done after the time expires. And then what it -- after having given that authority to the court, it then takes away the authority to extend the time to file.   It doesn't take away both of those things and they're disjunctive.   So what do we do about that? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, that very issue was addressed in the Robinson case, and that is, with that other issue, can an act be allowed later, the Robinson case found that to allow an act or a filing later would effectively enlarge or extend the period of time, and so, therefore, that would be prohibited. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The problem with Carlisle and Robinson is that they were well before our explanation of there being a difference between jurisdiction and non-jurisdiction claim processing rules.   And we were a little bit loose back then in terms of our textual approach to things. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Justice Gorsuch's question, though, is a fair one because it's the practice of the Supreme Court with respect to filing of amicus briefs that we don't grant extensions but we take late amicus. And so why can't we look at the exact words of 26(b) and say, no, you can't extend the time, but a court has, as it always has, equitable discretion to take something that's filed late because, assuming that the facts qualify as equitable, and that's open to question, I know, in this case, but assuming, why don't we read the provision as it states, a court can permit an act to be done after that time expires? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, let me address -- there were several parts to your question.   Let me try to address each in turn. Undoubtedly, and as this Court has stated repeatedly in recent decisions, that there was a sort of loose use of the term \"jurisdictional.\" However, and, in fact, that loose use of the word \"jurisdictional\" was, in fact, improperly used in the Robinson case. And that has been pointed out. But the Court in more recent decisions, particularly the Kontrick decision and the Eberhart decision, specifically cites Robinson as still good law, acknowledging, though, the term \"jurisdictional\" was misused, that, in fact, Robinson stands for, as Eberhart said, observing clear limits of the rules. So going back to the second part of your question, the Robinson case specifically addressed the issue that, well, if the Court has not addressed that second portion, an act that could be allowed, if we allowed a late filing, that would, in fact, eviscerate the first proscription and render, in fact, that portion of Rule 26(b) a nullity. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So what work does that language then do to permit an act to be done after the deadline? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " And I -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Why doesn't your interpretation itself render that language a nullity? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " And, Justice Gorsuch, I've been giving thought to that. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I had hoped you might. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So have I. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " And, Your Honor, I believe what that may open the door to are other acts that do not effectively enlarge or extend the period of time.   So there could be other categories of actions that the Court might consider and allow. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Give me an example, though, because 26(b) is entitled extension, extending time.   So I would have thought that it would have had to do something about time. And I'm just struggling to come up with an example of what work that language does under your interpretation. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, it might, for instance, countenance some other related proceeding or action, other than an extension of time on the actual motion for petition for permission to appeal that would be filed.   That might be an instance where that would apply. But I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry, you'll need to explain that to me because I'm not following you. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, I think the language in 26(b) as construed by Robinson in this instance would preclude an enlargement of the time to file.   But what another act that might be allowed could be an act that relates to another motion that might be filed in the proceeding or something collateral but not the actual motion itself. If, in fact, we read it to include the motion itself, the Court, and, of court -- course, the Court can revisit the thinking in Robinson, the Court would be moving right into the facts of Robinson and writing out the prescription on the extension of time. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The problem is that we really wouldn't -- yes, you're right, we would be revisiting Robinson, but we would be saying that the words of a statute have meaning, and Robinson read out of that permission the equitable considerations that the very statute permitted. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, this case is actually a stronger case with more emphatic language considered collectively than Robinson and Carlisle because we not only have the equivalent of Rule 45(b) and 26(b), we also have Appellate Rule 2, where there is, of course, the notion of equity and suspending the rules.   And the drafters specifically accepted the application of 26-2. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's a -- that's a circle with no out because 2 refers to 26(b), and if we read 26(b) the way I suggest, that already builds in the equitable exception. But, in terms of the purpose of the rule, we have previously said that 26(b) gives -- 26(f) gives the court, the trial court, almost unfettered discretion whether to grant the motion to appeal.   And if that's the case, wouldn't the natural reading of this be that the court should have unfettered discretion to decide if a late filing makes it think that the issue is more important than it might otherwise have thought? "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It's the discretion of the court of appeals, not the district court. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " To give permission to appeal. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, to answer your question, the court of appeals has discretion to accept a timely petition but does not have the discretion to accept an untimely petition because the rule-makers specifically removed that discretion in the language of 26(b) and 2, and there's one other rule that's applicable, and that is Appellate Rule 5(a)(2), which further reinforces that a petition must be filed within 14 days. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And Rule 26(b), it says generally the court may grant an extension of time.   But there's a category of cases in which it can't, and that is for permission to appeal, the time to appeal or the time to seek permission to appeal. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Yes.   Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but that supports our point. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Yes, it does. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Because, in that instance, we can clearly see the intent of the rule-makers in providing for a broad range of equitable discretion and then withdrawing it in the particular instance of 26(b). "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What do you think in -- I think it was Justice Ginsburg's concurrence in Carlisle, where she said that the Court had recognized one \"sharply honed equitable exception\" -- it doesn't have the word \"equitable,\" but it means it -- \"to mandatory claim processing rules.\" The unique circumstances exception. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Is that -- do you agree with that? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " -- I agree that Justice Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion and described -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " -- the unique circumstances doctrine as, indeed, a sharply honed exception that covers cases in which the trial judge misled a party who could have and probably would have taken timely action had the trial judge conveyed correct, rather than incorrect, information. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I believe the example was the trial judge, you have until X date to file, and the litigant filed on X date, but, in fact, the judge was wrong and it should have been an earlier date. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " That's right.   When there is a specific assurance by the trial judge and a mistaken one that the party reasonably relies on to its detriment, factually, that simply does not apply here, and this Court need not reach the applicability of the unique circumstances doctrine. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But that's -- that's different.   I mean, if you -- you agree -- I take it you agree that there is one sharply honed exception, whatever that might be, called unique circumstances.   You know, I can -- I can make up weird examples, probably you can too, but -- but is there such an exception? I take it your answer is yes or no? Is it yes or no? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, there has -- yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes? Okay. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " There has been an exception generally in several cases that has been described, the unique circumstances doctrine.   However, we have not been presented squarely with the question of whether -- when you have mandatory claim processing rules with emphatic language, whether that might preclude even the unique circumstances.

Holding 3, there is a unique circumstances exception.   Holding 4, this doesn't fall within it. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, if -- if I understand Holding 2, we are addressing not the facts here but claim processing rules that would be other than this sort of emphatic -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

And I'm not sure what you think is correct.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, are we slicing the baloney pretty thinly? I mean, what's unique, all right? A judge misinforming a party about the time remaining to appeal sounds pretty terrible.   But I can imagine a lot more terrible things than that.   Hurricanes, lightning, all of Justice Breyer's wonderful parade of horribles, all right? (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Why aren't those all unique circumstances too? Don't you really have to argue that Thompson's wrong and that, in fact, the rules here preclude any equitable tolling, and unique circumstances is a species of equitable tolling? Doesn't that have to be your argument? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, doctrinally, that is our argument, that when you have language as we do at issue here, emphatic and mandatory, it precludes the reading of all equitable exceptions.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I think you're going to have to choose between nothing, no time, never, and, sure, you can reserve some -- the possibility of an equitable exception in circumstances that are different from the ones here.   So which is it? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Your Honor, again, we don't believe the Court needs to reach the application of the unique circumstances doctrine.   And if that's the only one, the one sharply honed exception recognized to apply within the context of claim processing rules, and it factually does not apply, then the decision below must be reversed. But, to answer your question, I do believe that the language here is sufficiently emphatic and clear that it does not admit to equitable exceptions. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, it's not clear that you face this binary choice.   The problem with unique circumstances, a potential problem, is that every lawyer who is in trouble thinks that the circumstances of that lawyer's case are unique and every judge who wants to get to a particular result can characterize the facts of the case before the judge as unique.   But maybe there's such a thing as the catastrophic exception or the apocalyptic exception. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So, if there's a Martian invasion, there would be an exception for that.   But something short of that, you know, like the attorney is sick, wouldn't work.

Breyer", "text": " Well, it's rather hard to -- what is -- what is the answer to what Justice Alito says? We have the answer, as the Chief Justice points out, where the courthouse is closed, but one can think of epidemics or fires in the north -- and, you know, that's exactly right -- and what -- what do we write about that? What, in your opinion, do we write? A forest fire keeps the lawyer from the courthouse, which is open.   What -- what do we write? "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " All right.   So, in that instance, within the context of this case, Rule 23(f), the court, in fact, would not be allowed to admit an equitable exception in that circumstance.   That appears harsh, but it is not, and the drafters, I submit, had this in mind. A Rule 23(f) petition for permission to seek interlocutory appeal, if that cannot proceed, they have their full right of appeal at the end of the case.   No catastrophic or harsh consequence ensues.   And so -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, that's going to be too late in the real world of how the litigation transpires, though, you would admit? Too -- too late as a practical matter. "}, {"speaker": "John Hueston", "text": " Well, in the -- Justice Kavanaugh, in the context of class action cases, typically -- and, of course, the rules allow this -- you can continue to challenge the class certification or decertification order. So, practically, there is no catastrophic lost ability.   And having that fully retained appellate right puts the Petitioner in a far better circumstance than the party in Carlisle, who was faced with a plain error review on appeal, or a habeas route, one of the most difficult pathways in the law.

In other words, we can say never, and that's one answer; another is equitable discretion without any tight boundaries, and another is what -- what my opinion in Carlisle -- Carlisle referred to as sharply honed, not utterly exception-less.

And motions for reconsideration have not been described as equitable exceptions. And, again, the point I made earlier that they have been applied to delay in the context of the application of jurisdictional rules shows that they are not regarded by this Court historically as equitable in nature.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, it might be that -- that filing it within the period allowed under the particular rule at issue here would toll the time to appeal, but I don't see where anything -- I'm not sure the basis for the idea that filing a motion -- forget about Rule 23 for the moment -- filing a motion for reconsideration, so-called, tolls the time to appeal. As I said, there's no mention of that in the Rules of Civil Procedure.   And the Rules of Appellate Procedure set out quite clearly the particular motions that toll the time for filing a notice of appeal, and there's no mention there of a motion for reconsideration. There's a motion -- it mentions the motion to alter or amend the judgment. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan A. Herstoff", "text": " Well, I think the -- this Court's decision in Ibarra explains this well.   And the Court explained that the reason that reconsideration motions toll the time to appeal is to give the district court an opportunity to correct their own alleged errors and to prevent unnecessary burdens from being placed on the court of appeals. I think that's -- that's shown here, where you have a record on the class certification.   The district court is familiar with the record.   The district court here specifically said only 10 days after the decertification order that it was going to entertain reconsideration briefing. And during that time, the court agreed to suspend summary judgment proceedings, other pretrial proceedings, and trial.   So this was a considerable pause in the proceedings so that the district court would have a chance to reconsider before the case went up on appeal. And that -- I think that makes a lot of sense.   And I think the courts should not be discouraged from reconsidering before it goes up to the court of appeals.

I mean, when we did sort of tighten up the use -- loose use of the term \"jurisdiction,\" we -- we said that these are, nonetheless, mandatory. And for some of us at least, that made sense.   But if it -- if the alternative to a stricter application of the jurisdictional term was that equitable claims are going to be available across the board, I for one would want to reconsider our loosening of the use of \"jurisdiction\" because there ought to be some area, I thought, where the claims -- where the claim procedures were -- were mandatory in the sense that Justice Ginsburg has just talked about. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan A. Herstoff", "text": " So I -- I -- I don't think the claim processing rules are necessarily subject to any equitable exception.

Equitable tolling has been a part of American jurisprudence since the beginning and even in England prior to that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, yes, at a time where \"jurisdiction\" meant what we used to think it meant.

If it's a non-jurisdictional rule, then equitable grounds, but, certainly, Congress can stop that, or the rules committee.   And the way it stopped it was it said, normally, you can extend the time for good cause. Now that's quite broad.   But there's an exception for our case, which says you can't extend it for good cause.   So here we have for good cause, here we have zero, and I thought perhaps that Justice Ginsburg proposed a narrow exception that would, in fact, make it not for good cause but not zero.   And that's the unique circumstances sharply honed, which I guess covers Justice Alito's Mars attack -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

Herstoff", "text": " I -- I agree completely, Justice Breyer, with -- with what you're saying.   It is true that a good cause extension is not permitted for petitions for permission to appeal. Rule 26 does not say anything about equitable tolling.   Equitable tolling requires much more than simple good cause. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If, in fact, we are at sharply honed, special, unique circumstances, how do you win this case? Because what seemed to happen here is it was -- I don't know if it was you, but whatever lawyer went in for your side, within the 14 days, did not even ask the judge to extend the time, at least not in writing.   And so it's pretty hard to say you are, from an equitable point of view, in a unique circumstance. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan A. Herstoff", "text": " Well, I do think that the -- the Thompson rule applies here, because 10 days after the decertification order, the district court held a status conference during -- during which we asked for permission to file a motion for reconsideration in writing.   And at that time -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, on what ground would we overrule the circuit's rejection of that argument? You raised it below.

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan A. Herstoff", "text": " So the -- when the Ninth Circuit said that, it included within that language a reconsideration motion that's filed within the 14 days.   So what the court of appeals said was that the decertification order was made on February 20.   There was no Rule 23(f) petition filed within that 14-day period. And, therefore, unless an exception applies, it would be untimely. So the court was saying, even if a motion for reconsideration was filed within the 14-day period, it would be untimely.   So they considered that an exception as well.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " The -- the unique -- we've talked about unique circumstances.   Unique is defined as the only one.   There have been many hurricanes, there have been many fires, there hasn't been a Martian invasion yet, but what do you think it is? Unique is not unusual, right? So, if you're going to create an exception for unique circumstances, it can't mean the situation where judges misadvise litigants about how much time they have.   That doesn't happen all the time, but we've certainly seen more than one case of that. So, if you're going to say unique circumstances, what exactly does it mean, if it doesn't mean what the dictionary says? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan A.

In some, if it's an equitable tolling situation, it's typical that equitable tolling is appropriate, although not always.   So that's not unique. Now, if you're going to say it's an unusual circumstance, then I think you've opened the barn door.   If you're going to say it's a circumstance where the judge is the main villain in the missing of the deadline, well, then that's something else, and maybe that's better or -- or worse than unusual.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, then I think you do have to say the exception is when the district court misadvises the litigants, rather than saying \"unique\" but not really meaning unique, because then you get in a situation that Justice Alito was talking about. Most lawyers consider their case unique when they run into something like this, and the judges gives them a lot more flexibility than perhaps the rules committee wanted as well.

This is the court's fault in -- in putting a bad label on something that it actually meant when it meant -- meant something else.

I think that a district court misleading a party is more than simple excusable neglect or good cause.   Equitable tolling is as well.   I mean, in this Court's decision in Irwin, the Court said that statutes of limitations are presumptively entitled to equitable tolling and then went on to hold that in the facts of that case, equitable tolling was not established because the party -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan A.

So, if Thompson doesn't apply to jurisdictional statutes, one could say it does apply to mandatory but inflexible claims processing rules because it's not a species of equitable tolling at all; it is, in fact, a rule of judicial administration that, when it's our fault, shame on us. Or one could say, yeah, let's be honest, it's a form of equitable tolling and, therefore, shouldn't apply, just as it doesn't to jurisdictional rules, it shouldn't apply to mandatory claims processing rules, but should remain a viable option otherwise.   And that would harmonize Bowles with this line of cases. Which of those choices should we make and why? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan A. Herstoff", "text": " I do think that -- that these rules presumably should be subject to equitable tolling and not necessarily just for the district court misleading the parties.

Now if upon -- if the litigation goes on and a year later you're asking the court to reconsider its decision based upon the exact same evidence that was before the court a year earlier, I think that, as an initial matter, the Rule 23(f) petition is very unlikely to be granted because the court of appeals is going to see that as causing an unreasonable delay.

If somebody stands up in the situation like this and says, Your Honor, I'd like to file a motion to reconsider next week, is that okay? The judge says, sure, fine with me.   I don't think he should have to stop and say, well, let me research it and see if the time is expired by then. And then, if he says, well, if you're going to file it next week, file it on Friday. And it turns out Thursday's the deadline.   I mean, the judge has misled you, the lawyer would say, because he said I could file it on Friday.   It turns out the rule says I couldn't. So I'm not -- I'm not as comfortable with an exception for cases where the court misleads the parties because I'm not sure that's as clear a case as you might think of where the blame is justifiably placed on the judge.

So I think we go by the Healy, Dieter, Ibarra line of cases, which say a timely reconsideration motion suspends the time to appeal.   And, here, the reconsideration motion was, indeed, timely.
