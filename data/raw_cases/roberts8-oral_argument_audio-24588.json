Kovarsky", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 18 U.S.C. Section 3599 entitles indigent inmates facing the death penalty to reasonably necessary services.   And services are reasonably necessary when they would be used to identify or develop possible claims by a reasonable attorney representing a paying client of ordinary means. But in the Fifth Circuit, the standard is higher.   Inmates must show necessity that is not just reasonable but that is substantial. As a result, courts in the Fifth Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit alone, are permitted to probe deeply into the merits and procedural viability of as yet undeveloped claims that the requested services might support.

"}, {"speaker": "John G.

Kovarsky", "text": " Yes, I suppose in a situation where an inmate asks for an amount that exceeds $7500, the question might get presented because the chief judge writes it down to $7500.   But that's not this case. The basis of the lower court's decision in this case is just that the funds are not reasonably necessary.   The services are not reasonably necessary. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, one other jurisdictional question.   Is it true that the director of the Administrative Office of the Courts can under some circumstances review a funding grant, and, if that is so, how can the funding grant be the exercise of judicial power? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " That's not accurate, Justice Alito.   The cases that are recited in the Respondent's brief are cases about the AO's authority under the CJA, not under Section 3599.   Those are distinct statutes.   Of course, the CJA governs in all non-capital cases and 3599 governs in capital cases, and there's no authority in 3599 for the AO to do that.   And you'll notice that all of the cases that are recited in the Respondent's brief are from the 1970s, and that's, of course, because none of those scenarios recited there have anything to do with 3599. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Looking at the cases, my impression was that if, say, the defendant asked for $15,000 and the court gave $10,000 or maybe $20,000, whatever it is, or one side or the other disagrees with that, they can't appeal.   I mean, they can appeal.   It's like an administrative law.   Of course, they can appeal.   You can always appeal.   But you're going to lose because the statute is read by various courts, I think correctly, as giving very broad discretion to the trial court to decide how much. It's just like they want to call a witness or something.   I mean, you say this witness is irrelevant.   Well, the judge says I'm calling him.   You can appeal.   Ask for mandamus or something.   You're going to lose because it's up to the -- it's up to the court. And isn't that the same here and shouldn't it be the same? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " So, first, I don't -- I think it's true that there is -- that the district courts have enormous discretion to determine the award.   I don't necessarily mean -- know that that means that there wouldn't be jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It doesn't.   I'm saying it doesn't mean that. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It's just like any other situation where a trial court has to run his trial.   He has broad discretion over many areas, and that should be the same here. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Yes.   I mean, and, in fact, that's -- these -- these decisions are reviewable for an abuse of discretion.   And so there's extraordinary latitude in the district court to make these decisions.   So there's no need to, you know, worry about whether there's a jurisdictional basis because oftentimes what the district court does is going to carry the day. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Do you -- "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Now, if there are -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Do you believe that the statute can be read to mean that a district court, even if it finds reasonable necessity, that it has the authority not to award fees? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " I think there are certainly extenuating circumstances where the statute suggests that could happen. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And what would those be and what if a judge exercises that discretion improperly? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Okay.   So, before I answer that, I just want to be clear that's not the case that we have here.   The case that's decided here is reasonable necessity. Now -- so, for example, if there's some indication of gamesmanship on the part of federal habeas counsel, the resources are reasonably necessary at this point in the litigation because federal habeas counsel has decided not to pursue them at some earlier point when he or she should have. Or, as in -- as is the case in Texas, sometimes if there's a new claim discovered on federal habeas review and the federal habeas lawyer has to take it back to state court, the state court will pay for that litigation, and so the federal habeas -- sometimes the federal courts will say we're not going to write this check until we know whether the state courts are going to write the check.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The things, the examples that you just gave to Sotomayor, is that why you think the word \"may\" is in the statute? What is the effect of that word? What is it covering and what discretion does it allow? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Those are examples -- \"may\" is basically an escape hatch that allows a court to decline to award services under extenuating circumstances like the circumstances I just described. The other work that \"may\" does in the statute is affirm that review is for abuse of discretion, because when \"may\" is added to the statute, it's denominated as a technical amendment, which means that it is an amendment designed to conform the statute to what existing practice is. And so the idea is just that what the \"may\" is doing is clarifying what was already happening in the courts of appeal, which is to say that they review for abuse of discretion. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you believe it's appealable but under an abuse of discretion standard? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " It's appealable on an abuse of discretion standard, but as long as it's bound up with the case or controversy, as long as it's affecting the quality of the representation, then it's appealable. It's not like an order refusing licensure.   It's not like, as mentioned in Respondent's brief, a decision by a judge or justice to hire a clerk. Now maybe the closer question is when an attorney comes in after the case is over on a separate docket number and asks for compensation and a court doesn't want to award that because that decision, the attorney's fee decision after the case is finished, doesn't actually interfere with the representation. So you can make an argument that it's not part of the case or controversy, but as long as the decision under 3599 about resources affects the representation, then it's appealable.   Just -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Can we get back to what is the question here? I think you agree that the district court, as you said in your brief, may satisfy itself that a defendant may have a plausible claim or defense before granting the funds. So the -- the plausible claim is -- is a standard that a district court can require counsel to meet? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " This Court has used different formulations for referring to the obligations of federal habeas counsel.   In McFarland v. Scott, it says that the representation is designed to allow counsel to identify and develop possible claims. In McCleskey v. Zant, the way it's characterized is all relevant claims.   The dissent in McCleskey calls it all conceivable claims. I don't necessarily want to get caught up in, you know, is it plausible, is it conceivable, is it relevant.   The most on point authority uses the phrase \"possible claims\" and that's from McFarland v. Scott.   The representation has to be capable of allowing trial counsel to perform that function. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But what -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I would think the most relevant language is the language of the statute, \"reasonably necessary.\" And I really struggled with that, and also with the phrase \"substantial need.\" But taking \"reasonably necessary,\" if it just said necessary, that would be a pretty tough standard. Would you accept the interpretation of reasonably necessary to mean that this is something that a reasonable attorney would think is necessary? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " That -- the reasonable attorney standard and a reasonable attorney representing a client of finite means is the standard that we think is appropriate. And it's actually the way they interpreted the word \"necessary.\" Necessary is the word that appears in the CJA.   And they interpret necessary to mean reasonably necessary under the CJA, and every single court of appeals, with the exception of the D.C. Circuit, which does basically the same thing, interprets \"reasonably necessary\" to mean a reasonable attorney representing a client of finite means. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And the finite means business is just to make sure that, like a reasonable attorney for Bill Gates, would scour the earth and not care about it. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Exactly.   Or, you know, the standard doesn't involve a Richie Rich client or something like that. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But the -- but the attorney, the reasonable attorney still has to think that it is necessary, which is pretty tough. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Well, the standard that Congress -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Unless necessary doesn't mean necessary. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " We assume -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It's like the necessary and proper clause.   It doesn't mean that it's really necessary. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Right.   We know what Congress was thinking when it used the phrase \"reasonably necessary.\" "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You really know what they were thinking? (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Well, Congress plucked that phrase directly from the case law that was interpreting the word \"necessary\" in the CJA. And it's not a particularly close question in the courts of appeal about what the word necessary meant. At the time that Congress wrote the statute, necessary meant reasonably necessary, and reasonably necessary meant the reasonable attorney rule that I described at the top of my opening. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   What is the difference between \"reasonably necessary\" and \"substantial need\"? I have been racking my brain trying to think of something that it is reasonably necessary for me to obtain but as to which I do not have a substantial need. And I can't think of an example. Maybe you can give me an example. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " So, Justice Alito, I'm going to scrap the formal labels for a minute. I'm not going to use substantial need or reasonably necessary.   I'm going to talk about -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No don't -- - no, don't do that, because one is the statutory language and the other is the language that's used by the Fifth Circuit.   And that's what we have to deal with, no matter what the various courts of appeals have said about this. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " I'm just trying to answer the question functionally. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, okay.   All right. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " So, of course, a court can decide a 3599 motion by reference to a merits or procedural issue.   It's just that the referenced issue can't be intertwined with the evidence that the inmate is seeking in the motion. So take the following example.   A claim has two elements, element A and element B.   And the record is fully developed with respect to element A, and the record is not going to get any better with respect to element "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " A.   And the inmate comes to court under 3599 and asks for resources to develop element B. A court can decide the 3599 motion by reference to the merits if what it's doing is saying that your evidence on element A is never going to be good enough and we know that because the record there is fully developed. What the court cannot do and what the Fifth Circuit regularly does under its substantial need rule is say, oh, we're going to guess about what the record on B looks like. We're going to speculate about what you're going to find when you go out and you look for this mitigation evidence or this evidence of materiality, and we're going to -- we're going to guess, based on that estimation, that you're not going to meet that showing on element B. So that's the difference between reasonable necessity, which looks at what a reasonable lawyer would do, and the substantial need rule as operationalized by courts in the Fifth Circuit. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If I could -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But when you're -- but when you're talking about facts -- and this is the point you make in your brief -- how do you know that the record is fully developed under issue A? The lawyer can come in and say, well, if we have another investigator and could look further at this, we're going to develop some more facts.   I mean, it -- I'm not sure that that's a valid distinction in your case where it focuses solely on what facts are available. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " There are certainly some cases where an inmate will be requesting funds to develop both prejudice and deficiency, both prong 2 and prong 1. That is not our case.   In our case, the record for deficiency is fully developed. And it will often be the case that the record on deficiency is fully developed in the motion because the deficiency is the thing that should be evident from trial counsel's files and all the information that federal habeas counsel has available to her. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Now, do you think that that includes an attorney -- that's not the facts of your case.   I -- I know that in your case the defendant himself, to the first investigator who interviewed him, said he had had head traumas and -- and some dependency. And by the time the request for investigative services came about, he had already had a schizophrenic episode. But how about a case where there's no evidence whatsoever of dependency and/or of any mental illness, mental challenges, whatever you want to call it? Can an attorney come in and say it is common practice to do this, so I want to do it anyway? Even though there is no suggestion in the record that this is a fruitful inquiry? "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " The answer, unfortunately, is it depends.   So, in a case like ours where there's also no social history, something that this Court has said has to be performed in absolutely every single case, then, yes, the attorney can come into federal court and say -- without any evidence of red flags, and they can say look, they just didn't do a social history, that's deficiency, and should be able to get funds to look for what the prejudice from that is. Now, there are other cases, however, where counsel -- where trial counsel might have performed a social history, might have done some mitigation.   And if trial counsel can't show up and explain what the deficiency is and identify what flags -- red flags that trial counsel didn't follow up on, and can't provide a coherent explanation for why they need resources to go look for those flags, then a trial court would be within its discretion to deny the resources. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I have a separate jurisdictional problem that I'm hoping you can help me with and it concerns the COA requirement.   And neither side discusses it, but it's jurisdictional, so I'm -- I feel like I should give you a shot at it and you can help me out with it. The Fifth Circuit didn't require a COA because it read Harbison as saying one wasn't required.   But some circuits, including my old one, have distinguished Harbison in similar circumstances, pointing out that Harbison just dealt with the appointment, I believe, of clemency counsel, and the issue wasn't part of the final order in the merits of the habeas petition. Here, the denial of funding was part of the final order in the denial of a habeas petition.   And as I read 2253, a final order in a habeas proceeding, you need a COA. Now, maybe you can say it's just independent and totally separate from that. But then that might suggest you'd have to -- you'd be able to appeal as a matter of right anytime a funding denial takes place, even before a final judgment. And that seems odd too, though, because funding requests, attorney fee denials, sanctions, usually are wrapped up in and merged with the final judgment.   So, long-winded question, but it's jurisdictional, so -- and I thought you could help me out with that. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " Sure.

What the Fifth Circuit did in our case that it is not supposed to be able to do is speculate about the record on prejudice, which is the claim with two elements that I, you know, that I discussed.   The -- the evidence is developed on element A and they're speculating as to what the record is going to look like on B.

There were two and a half pages of mitigation evidence.   The prosecution gets up and says this is a perfect guy, there's no history of mental health, there's no mitigation on substance abuse.   The prosecutor at trial points to the deficits of mitigation investigation that trial counsel has done. We hear from the investigator that he's hired.   He's told to investigate.   And less than a month before trial, he starts trying to do things and fails completely, as Justice Ginsburg points out, to do even the basics of investigation, trying to get school records, that had nothing to do with not reaching the parents or not; not talking to a witness in California, where this man lived and worked for a long period of time; nowhere in Texas, because he had been there for a period of time.

The investigator began interviewing Petitioner several times in February 1996, subpoenaed psychological and disciplinary records, made multiple attempts to contact the Honduran family members, contacted several potential witnesses, searched criminal histories and attempted to obtain deportation records and California records.   In other words, this is not a situation where Rompilla and Porter, where there was simply no attempt at trying to provide a defense. Rather, the key feature here and what this case had been about up until just recently was the failure to contact the Honduran family members.

Breyer", "text": " To go back to what the -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, I can see -- I have a question about how the two parts of the statute worked. The first says reasonably necessary. And then there's the \"may\" question. Now, it would seem to me, I mean, it can work one of two ways.   In other words, the discretion that is granted to the district court could go to the question about whether something is reasonably necessary, the sort of things we've been talking about. I mean, maybe it's necessary if you haven't done anything, but maybe if you're saying, well, I think if I ask the parents a third time, maybe they'd give me a different answer. Or is it necessarily a two-step process where the judge has to make a determination: Is this reasonably necessary, and, if it is, then the district court judge can still deny it because it says \"may\"? Which of those do you think is how the statute should be read? "}, {"speaker": "Scott A. Keller", "text": " It's the second, Mr. Chief Justice.   And we know that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I was hoping you were going to say the first. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " On any grounds? (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Because under the first it does seem to me that all the stuff we've been talking about, you know, did they get the school records or not, did they talk to this person or not, how much did -- it strikes me that those are the sorts of things that would be very hard for a court in the normal -- an appellate court in the normal course to get into. On the other hand, it seems to me there are also things that you could say to the district judge.   They do these discretionary rulings all the time.   They're much more familiar than we are with how these sorts of mitigation investigations are conducted.   So that if the \"may\" goes into what's reasonably necessary, it seems to me that makes sense. If, however, you say the statute requires an inquiry, is this reasonably necessary, and then the district court has this unusual power to say, even though it meets the statutory standard, I'm not going to do it. "}, {"speaker": "Scott A. Keller", "text": " Well, let me clarify my answer in -- in this way.   The \"may\" language, switching from \"shall\" to \"may\" does imbue the district court with more discretion, again, assuming that there is jurisdiction. This would be a case sort of like Olano that we cite at page 45 of our brief where there what this Court said is a court can analyze, is this a serious issue? And that's very close to what the Fifth Circuit did here in asking is this a substantial -- is there a substantial need, or the Fourth and Sixth Circuits say is this a substantial question? And so those would be proper analyses that a district court could do.

Keller", "text": " -- with our jurisdiction argument, our position is that this is an administrative act, it is not a judicial act.

There was no discussion of this at all. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Yeah.   What do we do about that? On the one hand, it's jurisdictional.   On the other hand, it's not in the question presented. So, as Justice Breyer said, maybe we should let the court of appeals deal with that in the first instance. "}, {"speaker": "Scott A.

I may be wrong, but you don't have it in your briefs.   They don't have it in their briefs.   I don't have it in anything I've looked at yet. But I have it somewhere in the back of my mind, which is sometimes wrong. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So I'll look it up. Okay.   I believe -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " That's usually pretty reliable, too. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, it's not that reliable.   But the question -- this is reminding me of something, if I'm perhaps overly simple-minded on this, but what it reminds me of is the great argument that used to take place in ad law.   You see if, in fact, you reverse a fact finding of a district judge, you're supposed to do it if it's clearly erroneous.   You reverse a fact finding of an administrative ALJ, you're supposed to do it if there isn't substantial evidence in the record. All right.   That's what the statute does. That's -- so Jerome P. Frank, who was a great judge, one day said, my God, I've found it, eureka, I've found a case that a judge wouldn't reverse under the first standard but would -- or would -- would reverse under the first standard but wouldn't under the second. But then, when I looked at it more closely, I discovered I didn't have that unusual case anyway. See, he thought there was no difference. That spanned a bunch of law reviews that said, yeah, there is a difference.   Some said yes; some said no.   So why don't we just say, look, that's what the statute says.   Pick up his standard.   All these arguments you've been making, maybe good, maybe bad, make them to the district court.   Okay? End of case.   Fifth Circuit, you are to follow the statute.   And that's it. Good-bye.   And all these other arguments are for the lower court.   And if you want, you say that the lower court should take into account all the arguments that it deems relevant and significant.   All right? "}, {"speaker": "Scott A. Keller", "text": " And -- and in that narrow ruling, though, it would be very important for the Court to clarify a few things and, that is, first of all, a preliminary merits analysis is acceptable, as Petitioner has conceded, and second of all -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Why not just what would a reasonable lawyer do? And if the reasonable lawyer would make a preliminary analysis, fine.

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But isn't Martinez/Trevino suggesting the very essence of the exception to that rule, which is if you've not been given a chance, a fair chance to have some court decide your claim, then you haven't been represented.

It was only over -- it was -- it was clarifying Coleman in that very narrow instance and it was not -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Mr. Keller, this is the language that Martinez used.   Martinez said that these sorts of claims often require investigative work.   It said, I'm quoting again, \"they depend on evidence outside the trial record.\" So the whole exception that Martinez set out, you know, seems to be premised on the idea that there's an opportunity to develop the factual basis for the IAT -- IATC claim.

And the Court was only considering the narrow procedural default rules created by the Court, but when Congress has spoken -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, we said all this.   It often requires investigative work and it depends on evidence outside the trial record, and now you're saying we'll just take a look at this statute and say that of course it doesn't allow investigative work or evidence outside the trial record.   I mean, this is precisely what we said. "}, {"speaker": "Scott A. Keller", "text": " But when Congress has a statute that directs what the rule is for new evidence, and Congress is raising the bar after the Keeney decision, which was the cause and prejudice standard, that what Martinez said was this ought not put a significant strain on state resources, but this would, in fact, provide huge systemic costs on the system if you're going to open up a trial again and take in any new evidence in a claim of trial IAC which could bring in anything into the record. But that's the 2254(e)(2) issue. The point, though, on the question presented is that those type of considerations are absolutely proper for not only the circuit or the district courts to be analyzing but what a reasonable attorney would take account -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " A reasonable attorney with finite means might devote those finite means to an avenue of investigation that has very, very little chance of success because there is so much at stake. So I don't understand how that can be the test here, where the statutory language is reasonably necessary. That seems clearly -- whatever necessary means, it -- it means some degree of importance.   It has -- the evidence has to be -- has to meet some level of importance in order for the standard to be met. I don't see how you can get around it. And to say the test is whether -- what would a reasonable attorney with finite means do, I -- it seems to me quite meaningless. "}, {"speaker": "Scott A.

"}, {"speaker": "Scott A. Keller", "text": " Well, because we're in a habeas context, the reasonable necessity analysis has to account for the limits on habeas review.   Petitioner has relied on many non-habeas cases. And what a counsel does at the beginning of a case when there's no record, there has been no trial, that analysis may look very different.   But when we're talking about what is reasonably necessary on federal habeas review, that will necessarily account for habeas limitations that have been placed on "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " May -- may I ask you before your time runs out, I wasn't clear about your position on prejudice.

And it's not only the brutality of the crime. There was a robbery at gunpoint three days later with a threat to kill the victim's family.   There was an admission to wanting to kill accomplices.   There was a threat to kill another witness through his confession, and the criminal history that resulted in jail time after violating probation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Scott A. Keller", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Four minutes, Mr. Kovarsky. "}, {"speaker": "Lee B. Kovarsky", "text": " When federal habeas counsel got this case, they looked at the record and they saw that when invested with the momentous responsibility of explaining to a court why the defendant's moral feedback loop was not such that it should impose the death penalty, the sentencing phase, mitigation presentation, lasted two minutes. They also saw that there had been no social history performed.   They saw that there had been no mental health expert that had examined the defendant, and that the trial counsel had failed to follow up on red flags. They saw in the state habeas file that state habeas counsel was told by his investigator nine days after he hired her that the first thing he had to do was a mitigation investigation and a social history, and he didn't do that. And we know that there's a there there because there is a diagnosis of schizophrenia in the record.   It is inconceivable that a reasonable attorney, having received this file, getting this case, would do anything other than precisely what federal habeas counsel did in this case. And the reasonable attorney standard is the right standard because it is the standard that Congress picked. At the time Congress enacted Section 3599, it knew that courts had spent 20 years defining reasonable necessity, using a reasonable attorney rule. And it's also the desirable rule because it gives effect to the dominant purpose of the statute, which is to promote parity in representation as between those capable of paying for it and those who aren't. And, finally, it's a really good standard because it's workable.   It's flexible enough to apply across phases of the capital representation, courts have 50 years of experience in dealing with it, and it's got meaningful limits. Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the rest of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
