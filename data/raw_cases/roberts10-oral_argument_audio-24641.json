And so, on the face of the statute, it articulated non-safety rationales for what was, the court of appeals determined, its -- its concealed purpose, which was radiation hazards of nuclear power generation.

As I was saying, the -- the Entergy case itself, the legislature was very careful to attempt to obscure what was, and the courts determined quite properly, what was genuinely animating the legislative body in that case. And it's not unusual in this particular area.   And when -- when Congress determined to create a system of dual regulation and drew the line between the purpose of the state to regulate radiation hazards, it was reserving for the federal government that particular area with good reason. It was allowing the states to regulate in the area of electric generation as they had always done and to -- if -- if -- if the states would have regulated this particular plant as though it was a fossil fuel plant, then there would be no doubt that its purposes were not nuclear safety.

If the -- the person, the plaintiff challenging the preemption of the statute can demonstrate that the prohibited purpose was a motivating factor, then the state has to come in and show that it would have been enacted even in the absence of the motivating factor. And, again, the -- the -- the Congress drew the line here because it wanted to ensure -- and this was -- purpose is actually in this a narrowing preemption because, typically, if -- if the state enacts a measure, regardless of what its purpose is, that is an indirect regulation of that which is exclusively federal.   As in the National Meat Association case, the court doesn't look into what the purpose was.   It simply preempts it, quite properly. This actually takes -- takes the standard preemption doctrine and its state -- it's friendlier to the state's interests because it allows states, as (k) explicitly says, to regulate the materials at issue -- source, byproduct, and special nuclear materials -- for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards. But, when it comes to something that dramatically important, protection against radiation hazards of these nuclear materials, the Congress wanted that to be exclusively federal, and so it drew the line on -- on purpose.

And, you know, Mr. Cooper said there's the whether question and the how question.

Take the National Meat Association case, for example, a decision of this Court. The federal government had exclusive regulatory authority over slaughterhouse operations.   And what the Court made clear was that the state couldn't use its authority over the sales of meat to reach into and indirectly regulate slaughterhouse operations. Here, the purpose inquiry actually narrows the scope of preemption because not only does the state have to use the authority that it does have to reach into and indirectly touch upon something that the federal government regulates, it has to do so for a very specific and impermissible purpose. And I think that if you adopted a contrary rule, unlike the one adopted by the Fourth Circuit, it really is a road map for completely undermining a multibillion-dollar industry. And that, Your Honor, is the reason I was citing Skull Valley, not because I believe that the holding obviously is binding on this Court, because its facts show that a state could simply shut down all nuclear activity by designating the roadway leading up to a nuclear plant as unsuitable for commercial trucking, even if the only commercial trucks that ever go up that roadway are to make deliveries to the facility.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, purpose is usually a subjective concept, but -- and that's what Congress -- that's the term Congress chose to use in 2021(k), but is there a way of understanding that as applying an objective standard that doesn't boil down to rational basis review?

I think that the way you would analyze this is by looking at the text, the legislative history, the historical context in which it was enacted, and the plausibility of any permissible non-safety rationale that the state puts forward. If the state puts forward a plausible non-safety rationale and that rationale is not otherwise foreclosed by the text, legislative history, and historical context, then I think the state wins. The problem in this case is that the Fourth Circuit effectively assumed that the purpose of this law was to prohibit uranium processing because uranium processing was unsafe.   But it held that that was simply irrelevant to the disposition of the case.

We have a lot of congressmen with a lot of different purposes. I'm not sure I understand how you're going to solve the problem.   In Virginia, we have in this record evidence that they're concerned both about -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right.

So what do we do with those cases where, at the end of the day, it's indeterminate? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " So two responses, Your Honor.   The first, which I'll get off of quickly because I -- I don't think you're going to find it fully responsive, is that you don't have to address that here because the Fourth Circuit refused to apply any purpose inquiry at all. But, secondly, I think that the answer lies in where the burden of proof is.   The burden of proof is on those challenging state law.   And if they cannot establish that the principal or predominant purpose of this law was impermissible, then they lose. And so, here, the Fourth Circuit refused to undertake any inquiry at all because it effectively assumed that the purpose was in Petitioners' favor but concluded that that was irrelevant.

Just one other example. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, General, you -- you've been talking about the undermining of this industry, but I guess a couple of things is, one is that as long as there is this other purpose or as long as the state can say that there's this other purpose, it will just as successfully be able to undermine the industry. And then on the -- on the -- as well, this statute does give the federal government the ability to make sure that states can't really undermine it if the federal government wants a nuclear industry badly enough, because, in addition to the fact that somebody can import this material from another state or from another country, the federal government itself can mine for this material on its own lands, or it can condemn lands and -- and do it with newly acquired lands.

On the first part of your question, we assume that the states engage in good faith, and we assume that the states aren't going to misstate their reasons for doing something. But I will tell you that it is a lot more difficult for a state to, for example, rezone all land that nuclear activity is taking place on as residential, even if it's totally unsuitable for residential dwelling, if they know they're going to have to come forward and justify that.

When we're talking about a tailings facility, we're in an area of overlapping authority because NRC regulates tailings management.   And at that point, you are covered by 2021(k).   And the Court has to conduct the sort of purpose analysis that's mandated by 2021(k). Our submission is that this case is fundamentally different because we are regulating mining -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But, when you're regulating mining, you're always regulating milling because you have the two together, but you can't regulate milling, as you acknowledge, but the two are interlinked in a way that I'm not sure you can disaggregate in the way you're doing. "}, {"speaker": "Toby J. Heytens", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh, I understand that conceptually we -- we could have a metaphysical debate about whether you can separate mining and milling and whether -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " It's -- in the real world, it's not separated. "}, {"speaker": "Toby J. Heytens", "text": " Well, Justice Kavanaugh, in the statute, it's separated.   And in NRC's judgment, they're separated. I think the best evidence of that is discussed in our brief.   It's the Hydro Resources decision of NRC.   So this is a case in which NRC is regulating an activity that they have the authority to regulate.   It's a milling process.   Right? And NRC has argued that, as part of their regulation of milling, they should take into account background radiation that exists because of previously un-NRC regulated mining. And NRC says we can't do that.   We're not allowed to take into account the consequences of previous mining activities because we, NRC, have no authority to regulate mining.   Even though we have authority to regulate milling, we, NRC, can't regulate mining.   And even taking into account radiation that exists because of that previous mining would constitute impermissible NRC regulation of mining. And so I think regardless of whether as a metaphysical level we could say milling and mining are so inextricably intertwined that the regulation of one is necessarily the regulation of the other, I think both Congress and the text of the statute, right, I mean, so that's the other point, this statute from the beginning has given NRC the ability to regulate milling. And in the entire history of this Act, NRC has never once advanced the argument, as far as we're aware, that says because we can regulate milling, a fortiori we can regulate mining because mining is inextricably intertwined with milling. In fact, NRC has aggressively disclaimed that argument in a decision where a great deal actually turned on that argument. But the second question to raise, Justice Breyer -- to go back to Justice Breyer. So I think the first reason that Justice Breyer's example isn't covered by this situation is that we concede, once we're dealing with an NRC-regulated activity, a tailings facility, 2021(k) requires some sort of purpose analysis.   That's why the court did a purpose analysis in Pacific Gas. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And that's also why Skull Valley is right? "}, {"speaker": "Toby J. Heytens", "text": " Yes, Justice Kagan, because the vast majority of the activities in Skull Valley were NRC-regulated activities. And we have no quarrel with that decision whatsoever. But the other reason is even if -- so, to go back to Justice Alito's hypothetical, excuse me -- even if it appeared on the face of the statute, the first reason we think that that law is not preempted, and if that law's not preempted, this law is obviously not preempted, but even if the Court were inclined to reserve judgment or to carve out an exception for a law where that sort of purpose is stated on the text or the face of the statute, there would be no justification for unleashing the, all things considered, subjective motivations of the state legislature that we see in the blue brief and the yellow brief. And, here, I think what -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now the motives in my opinion is a bad word because you don't know people's motives.   You don't normally look into that.   Motives can be backward-looking.   He did it out of revenge.   They can be referring solely to a past fact.   He hit my sister, that's why. But we're concerned with the subset of that where we're looking to the future.   And I think you're right to say that's purpose.   When we talk about -- and every judge, as far as I know, including Justice Scalia, whom we used to talk about this, sometimes will look to a statute's purpose.   Go back to Lord Cooke.   Go back as far as you want. Name any judge in American history, and who's been heard of, of course, we have a dozen ways of looking at purpose.   So what's wrong with looking at purpose here? I grant you a state legislature, unlike Congress, is less likely to hold on the record hearings about a statute, but then that would be a reason for saying, when we try to determine purpose, we do not look necessarily to legislative history as written in committee reports because there aren't any. Now there Justice Scalia and I could have a lot of arguments about whether you do, whether you don't, but that's beside the point. When you say don't look at purpose, there I get off the boat because I think that's our job as a court in -- in a relevant case to determine what the purpose of the statute is.   Sometimes it's easy.   Sometimes it's tough. So what's wrong with what I just said? "}, {"speaker": "Toby J. Heytens", "text": " I think I have two answers, Justice Breyer. The first one is that when we're dealing with a state legislature, which is fundamentally, as you say, unlike Congress, and it's unlike Congress in a different way.   A state legislature does not have to show its authority to do something. Under our federal system, the challenger has to show why a state legislature may not do something.   So the first thing I'd say is we'd have to know why would the purpose of this law matter.   And to go back to, I think, something that was brought up by Justice Gorsuch, our fundamental view is, because Congress does not regulate mining in any way, in any shape, or any form, it does not matter the purpose for which Virginia has chosen to forbid mining. But even if the Court wanted to carve out an exception for the case that we've talked about earlier, I think -- I think, Justice Breyer, you're absolutely right.   I think the purpose of the statute is an Orthodox question of statutory interpretation and should be determined the way the Court normally does. The face of this statute regulates mining.   The face of this statute cites environmental and natural resources consequences that flow from mining. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And what does that mean?

This would be a massive disruption of Virginia's stated view.   We're talking about a fundamentally profoundly rural area of Virginia that's building its economy based on agriculture and tourism.

And if we start looking at this statute, I don't even know where to begin, because it talks about the environmental and local resource impacts of mining and milling and tailings and everything else. Now could a rational legislator have done this only for concern about mining? Maybe.

"}, {"speaker": "Toby J. Heytens", "text": " Right.   The line, we think, is straightforward.   It's based on the text of the statute.   It's NRC-regulated activity, because, in both the Skull Valley decision and in the Entergy decision, the state law was directly acting upon and regulating something that is itself regulated by NRC. The spent nuclear fuels facility in Skull Valley was regulated by NRC.   The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant was certainly regulated by NRC.   And the Court would do -- now I want to bring up the roads provision because Mr. Cooper mentioned them. They say there's this one provision of the law at issue in Skull Valley that turns a county road into a state road. Well, I'D say two things about that provision.   First, if that's literally all that Utah did, all Utah did was to convert a road from a county road to a state road, and that's the only thing they did, there would be no basis whatsoever for finding that law standing alone was preempted by the Atomic Energy Act. And to the extent that it operated -- I think there was also discussion of the National Meats case, which I think is affirmatively helpful for us because, at the end of the opinion in National Meat, the Court got to the sales provision of the California law and the Court said: You know, this doesn't directly act upon the conduct that's regulated by federal law.   And so I guess you could make an argument, and the Humane Society made the argument, that's not preempted. And here's what the Court actually said in National Meat.   That argument ignores the way that the sales provision operates within state law as a whole. California didn't enact the sales provision as a free-standing provision.   They enacted the sales provision as part of an interrelated series of laws that in the court's language regulated the same thing as the federal government, just in a different way. And we think that's directly on point, because when this Court CVSG'd in Skull Valley, the Solicitor General's CVSG brief adopted that precise rationale when it came to the roads provision.   It said the roads provision has to be analyzed as part of how Utah's entire scheme is regulating the spent nuclear fuels facility. You have to look at the scheme as a whole and you have to look at how the entirety of the series of interrelated laws work.

Of course, allowing the nation's largest state to prevent nuclear power construction -- nuclear power plant construction, of course, that is going to have a profound impact on the civilian nuclear power industry in the United States.   And the Court acknowledged that, and the Court said: No, we understand, California could do that, but we've concluded that Congress has nonetheless given California the right to regulate for economic safety reasons.   And it is for Congress, not for this Court -- this is what the Court specifically said in Pacific Gas -- if Congress concludes that California is misusing the authority that has been left to them, it is for Congress to tell the state that.

I know there's discussion in some of the briefing in this case that suggests that there are radiological concerns associated with the mining process itself.   Congress said that sitting in the -- excuse me -- a committee report from 1946 says that, sitting in the ground, uranium does not create radiological safety concerns.   But there's the separate question of whether the process of digging it out of the ground raises any radiological safety concerns. And I think there's at least some evidence in some of the briefing that there may be at least some radiological safety concerns associated with doing that.   Without saying they're the same as milling. And there -- regardless of whether there are radiological safety concerns, there are clearly a wide variety of health and safety concerns associated with extracting massive amounts of material out of the ground. And so we think that, at the end of the day, the purpose -- this Court has reaffirmed repeatedly that the purpose of a statute includes not only what it sets out to change but also what it resolves to leave alone. And we think the single clearest and completely dispositive decision by Congress in this case was the decision it made in 1946 that it reaffirmed in 1954 and has left undisturbed until the present day, that the federal government does not regulate uranium mining. For that reason, Virginia's inherent sovereign ability to control something as fundamental as what material gets pulled out of the ground remains fully intact, its ban should not be preempted, and this Court should affirm.

They weren't concerned about radiological aspects of -- of mining qua mining any more than the NRC is.   It's the milling and the tailings that represent the threat of nuclear safety. And there were two ways they could do it.   They could do it directly.   We prohibit milling in this state.   But that would have run straight into a stop sign, Your Honor, of preemption.   There's no way it could do -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Suppose -- suppose -- suppose they say our rationale does have to do with the mining, not the milling; we think there are radiological hazards from -- from the unearthing the -- the uranium.   Suppose they said that. "}, {"speaker": "Charles J. Cooper", "text": " Your Honor, they could say that, but a court would have to look behind it, would have to look behind at using all the techniques that my friend, the Solicitor General, has mentioned, including plausibility. But, to come back, Justice Kavanaugh, I want to make clear that the Court understand, as Justice Gorsuch has referenced, that the statute that banned mining had sister provisions.   In the very same breath, Virginia enacted a -- a uranium administrative group, tasking it with the -- with the responsibility to study uranium mining in -- in Virginia and milling and tailings.   On page 185 -- I would refer the Court to 185 through 187. With respect to milling activity, the capacity -- these are things that they're supposed to study -- the capacity of the mill, the process to be used in milling and ore extraction, the reagents in processing material, the method for conveying tailings and wastewater from milling. The next paragraph, with respect to tailings management, the quantity and characteristics of the tailings, the method of disposal, treatment systems for the removal of solids, radionuclides, on and on for the next several pages -- pages. The -- the courts below and my friends for the Commonwealth have focused myopically on the one sentence that is the ban.   What was really happening here and the purpose of this was to prohibit milling and tailings management, the only thing that really represents serious radiological hazards. Second point, dual regulation.   My friend quotes from PG&E, Justice Gorsuch, and I want to -- I want to finish his quote.   He didn't get to finish it.   \"Congress has preserved the dual regulation of nuclear-powered electricity generation.\" This is from 212, 211, 212.   Colon: \"The Federal Government maintains complete control of the safety and \"nuclear\" aspects of energy generation ... the States exercise that -- their traditional authority.\" Justice Gorsuch, traditional authority, which they've always exercised over the generation, transmission, and sale of electricity, over the -- over the need for additional generation, generating capacity, the type of generating facilities to be licensed, are they going to be coal or nuclear. Your -- Your Honor, in California -- in PG&E, California had the antecedent authority, its and its alone, to decide whether there would be a plant of any kind, including a nuclear plant.   And if there was no nuclear plant, there could be no NRC authority or regulation over how that thing was constructed or how it was operated. My final point here, plausible non-safety rationale.   This is the one place where I guess I do disagree with my friend, the Solicitor General.   That sounds too much to me like rational basis review, like any conceivable thing that -- that the state could bring forward or a judge could even conceive of will do the trick. That's not what Congress had in mind when it said: Courts, look at the purpose.   Is the purpose for the protection against radiological hazards? That's what Congress wants you to decide. And not just is it any plausible purpose, is it -- is -- is it -- is that the purpose? And you have to do your best.   It's not easy.   But that's -- that's the question that -- that Congress has said is before the courts. And if the courts conclude in their best efforts that that's the purpose, well, then it's preempted. Thank you, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
