[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case Number 19-422, Collins versus Mnuchin, and the consolidated case. Mr. Mooppan. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Third Amendment, FHFA, acting as conservator of Fannie and Freddie, renegotiated the enterprises' financial obligations to Treasury by replacing the enterprises' multibillion-dollar dividend and fee obligations with a variable dividend tied to their net worth.   The conservator eliminated any risk that the cycle could continue where the enterprises' obligations to Treasury would themselves cause draws from Treasury's capital commitment. The shareholders' statutory and constitutional challenges to the Third Amendment fail for many reasons, but there are three key defects that I'll try to address today. First, both claims are barred by the Recovery Act's succession clause, which transfers to the conservator the authority to decide whether shareholders may bring derivative suits on behalf of the enterprises.   The type of shareholder injury alleged here, that the corporations' assets have been unlawfully dissipated to a particular shareholder, is plainly derivative rather than direct.   The shareholders have not cited even a single case to the contrary. Second, the statutory claim is barred by the Recovery Act's anti-injunction clause, which prevents courts from restraining exercises of the conservator's powers or functions.   The conservator acted well within its authority in deciding that the renegotiation of the enterprises' financial obligations may have been appropriate to preserve and conserve Treasury's capital commitment.   The shareholders cannot second-guess the wisdom or motives behind that business judgment. Third, the constitutional claim fails because President Obama had unrestricted power to remove and thus to supervise both of the officials who signed the Third Amendment. Treasury Secretary Geithner was, of course, removable at will, and so too was Acting FHFA Director DeMarco.   Thus, while the statutory restriction on the President's power to remove the FHFA director is invalid, it had no prejudicial effect on the Third Amendment. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, you say that the common stockholders' claims can't survive because they're derivative, really claims of the corporation, and -- and then barred by the succession clause. But it seems to me that they're a little different, according to the claims anyway, that their stock value -- their stock was completely wiped out in a unique way compared to the other holders of interests in the enterprises, in other words, that this action was directed at them as distinct from the corporation as a whole; therefore, is not derivative, they claim, and -- and shouldn't be barred.   What -- what is your answer to that? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So, as we cite in our reply brief, we cited cases from the Delaware Supreme Court and from Judges Bork, Easterbrook, and Posner, all of whom recognized that when corporate assets are dissipated, that's a derivative claim even though where the recipient is a shareholder, such that the financial -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Yeah -- "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " -- effect -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- but, when you have -- excuse me -- but, when you have different categories of shareholders or people with financial interests, and the complaint is that they -- the one class was particularly targeted, it does seem to me that that class has a unique claim that can't be characterized as just a claim of the corporation. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think that there's no reason to differentiate between a dissipation of corporate assets pursuant to a dividend payment versus a dissipation of corporate assets pursuant to a side transaction. In the cases that we cited in our reply brief, each of those cases involved certain shareholders being treated better than other shareholders, and it shouldn't make any difference for purposes of a derivative claim whether that special treatment occurs pursuant to a side transaction or through a dividend payment.   I assume -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, maybe shareholders being treated differently, but, when the way you're being treated differently is that you're completely wiped out, I mean, the corporation doesn't have any particular interest in the balance, it seems to me, or at least not the same sort of interest as the shareholders who are left out in the cold. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Well, I think that the harm here is in the first instance to the corporation.   The claim is that the corporate assets have been dissipated, so the corporation does have an injury.   And I guess one way of making the point I've been trying to make is I think the shareholders would have the exact same objection if Fannie and Freddie had entered into a contract with the Treasury Department where they bought a commemorative coin from the Treasury Department and paid them for that all of their net worth in perpetuity. That would be exactly like the claims that we cited in our reply brief where you had a side transaction to one shareholder, to the disadvantage of all the other shareholders, and that's -- there's just no difference for purposes of a derivative claim whether the harm to the certain shareholders comes because of a side transaction or pursuant to an amendment to the dividend obligation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Well, counsel, would you -- perhaps this is redundant, but give us another example of what a direct would look like rather than a derivative. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So direct claims are claims where the injury to the shareholder is -- doesn't turn on a harm to the corporation.   So, for example, if shareholders are injured in their right to vote, that doesn't implicate the rights of the corporation.   It is a direct shareholder claim. Those -- and the -- the cases that have recognized direct suits where shareholders are harmed tend to be in those sort of contexts where there's a dilution of, for example, voting power.   That's what the Delaware Supreme Court laid out in its El Paso case. Mere harm to shareholders because the corporate assets have been dissipated is a derivative claim.   Harms to the shareholders' ability to do things that don't turn on a harm to the corporation first, those are direct claims. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, what if you had -- and I know the -- this agreement doesn't say this directly -- but an agreement that simply transferred directly all dividends from existing shareholders, say, to Treasury, that it explicitly said that? Would that be -- I -- I think it's rather odd that your -- that the shareholders' dividends can be jeopardized or depleted and that's not a direct claim, but the right to vote on corporate matters is a direct claim. So what if -- so what if it was more explicit? What would you say to that? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So I think that would be different.   I think the difference is it's not a question of being explicit versus implicit.   In your hypothetical, they are acting directly on the shareholders' contractual right to dividends.   That doesn't harm the corporation at all. Maybe one way of thinking about it is it's the difference between the size of the pie and the share of the pie.   The claim here is that the corporate assets have been dissipated. That is a question about the -- the size of the pie, and that is a harm to the corporation. In your hypothetical, what has been changed is the share of the pie by -- there's been a direct action on the shareholders' right to dividends that's been transferred to another shareholder.   But, importantly, that's not what's going on here.   It might be the effect. Whenever the corporation has less assets, that's going to affect shareholders' ability to get dividends, no matter why this corporation's assets have been wasted or stolen. And, you know, Judge Posner's opinion in the Seventh Circuit lays this out pretty clearly, that when you have a harm to the corporate assets, it just doesn't matter why the assets have been dissipated, whether it's by theft or a conflict of interest or a side transaction.   In all events, the harm is in the first instance to the corporation, not to the shareholders. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Thank you. I think, in reading this, you could, with trying to simplify as much as possible, view the shareholders' claim as saying we bought into this corporation, it was supposed to be private as well as having a public side, and then the government nationalized it.   That's what they did.   If you look at their giving the net worth to Treasury, it's nationalizing the company. Now whatever conservators do and receivers do, they don't nationalize companies. And when they nationalized this company, naturally, they paid us nothing and our shares became worthless.   And so what do you say? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Well, Your Honor, what the Third Amendment did is it renegotiated the enterprises' financial obligation.   The enterprises were saddled with bigger -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, no, I know that, but what I wonder is can you -- is it fair to characterize it not with this more legal language but just saying, look, they nationalized it, they gave the company away to the Treasury.   Who do you think the Treasury is? It's the government of the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Right.   And -- and what I would -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And, by the way, you'll want to really look into this and you'll discover they didn't get enough money for it, they did it at too cheap a price, they did it dot, dot, dot, and they paid us nothing.   All right.   But can I view this as nationalization? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " No, Your Honor, because -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Because? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " -- because what the --- the agreement does is it replaces a 20 billion dollar a year dividend.   So the enterprises already owed to the federal government 20 billion dollars a year. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " What the conservator did was say rather than having that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, that -- that goes to the reasonableness of the agreement. They say, okay, let's have a trial on that. We -- you -- they think it's a very reasonable thing to do.   We don't. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " And the point is the anti-injunction clause doesn't expose the conservator's business judgment to reasonableness review. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " The question is whether -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Correct.   If -- "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " -- they exceeded their powers -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " They say nationalization is not the kind of thing conservators and receivers do and, therefore, you can examine it, and when you examine it, you will see how unreasonable it is. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Your Honor, what the enterprises did was they renegotiated financial obligations.   That is what they did.   Whatever label the plaintiffs want to put on it -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, that was my fault. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " What the actual power that was exercised here was a renegotiation of financial obligation.   That is what conservators do day in and day out. Now the terms of this renegotiation are fairly unique, but that's because the enterprises were in a fairly unique condition. Most companies don't owe 20 billion dollars a year to the federal government. And so, when they switched that and they switched it to -- to ensure that there was no risk to the quarter trillion dollars of capital that Treasury had committed to these enterprises, that is the nature of the agreement here. It is an unusual agreement, but it is still -- at the end of the day, it is a renegotiation of financial obligations that is a heartland exercise of conservatorship power, and if the anti-injunction clause means anything, it means that you don't second-guess whether they could have done it a different way, whether it was a bad deal, whether they did it for bad motives.   At the end of the day, what they did is they renegotiated financial obligation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If we agree with you about the removability of an acting director and also agree with you that the only relevant action was one taken by the acting director, would we have any reason to address the question whether the restriction on the removal of a confirmed director is constitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Well, yes, Your Honor. The court of appeals, in addition to declining to set aside the Third Amendment, did issue a declaratory judgment that prospectively the FHFA removal restriction should be set aside. Petitioners here did file a cert petition where that is the first question presented.   We think the Court should confirm that that was a correct holding, that that removal restriction is invalid and shouldn't be applied prospectively, but we do think that it is no basis to set aside the Third Amendment, both because the acting director is, in fact, removable at will -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, perhaps this is -- if it's legally irrelevant, it could be vacated on that basis without reaching the merits of the question. But let me ask you this: What is your response to the argument on the other side that confirms directors took actions pursuant to the amendment and, therefore, we have to consider the status of confirmed directors? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Your Honor, I don't think they've actually ever challenged any action enforcing the Third Amendment by confirmed directors.   And I don't know what those actions would be since there it -- it's ministerial.   The Third Amendment requires the dividends. At most, maybe the -- the -- the only thing I can even think they might be talking about, though I'd be curious what they have to say, is whether to pay the dividends under the Third Amendment in cash or, instead, in kind through the liquidation preference.   That wouldn't do them any good either way, so I'd be surprised if that's what they're challenging. But, other than that, I don't know what it would be that they'd be referring to. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If we were to reach the issue of the removability of a confirmed director and if we were to agree with you on that question, what basis do you have for distinguishing between the relief that you think is appropriate in this case and the relief that was provided in cases like Bowsher, Seila Law, and appointments clause cases where an appointments clause violation was found? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So I think the most significant difference is the fact that in this case, the Treasury Secretary was a party to the action that's being challenged.   Their constitutional claim is a claim that the agency action was unconstitutionally insulated from presidential supervision. And unlike in all of the cases you just mentioned, here, one of the parties to the contract is the Treasury Secretary, who, of course, is removable at will by the President and is the President's right-hand man.   So no one can say that the President didn't have sufficient control over this agreement.   And that's why, if -- if the APA's presidential error rule means anything, it means you can't set aside a multibillion-dollar agreement on the theory that the President didn't have enough control over it when the President's Treasury Secretary signed it.   That's -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Just -- Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I just want to make sure that I get the gist of your argument, and I think I have it right.   I know you and the shareholders disagree on whether this deal had a reasonable cause, but let's posit a deal that didn't.   For no rational base -- reason, the FHFA sold all of Fannie and Freddie's assets in exchange for one dollar to itself.   It did exactly what Justice Breyer said.   It nationalized things.   It nationalized the company.   Your position is that there is no court review of a decision by the FFH as conservator that could give shareholders the right to challenge their action? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So we think -- in -- in a hypothetical like that, we think you could -- the -- we don't think the anti-injunction clause would bar a claim that actions were taken that have no objective rational justification of being taken to preserve and conserve assets.   We do think that even that claim would be barred by the succession clause because it would still be a derivative suit. But, if you -- if the Court disagreed with us about the succession clause, we don't -- we aren't arguing that the anti-injunction clause means that there's no review of anything the conservator does.   We are just saying that when the conservator takes action that may be appropriate and necessary to preserve and conserve assets, there's no second-guessing the business judgment.   And I think that's an important point here, that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right, counsel, let me just stop you there.   If the company is still in existence but owned by the FHFA, there is no claim.   This -- my colleagues have posited something close to this.   But it is the shareholders who have been kicked out for no business reason.   I don't see how that's a derivative suit that the succession clause would bar. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M.

All they have lost -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, the -- the corporation's not losing its profit.

Their -- their claim is that Fannie and Freddie -- FHFA acted improperly in giving away the assets of the corporation. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right, counsel, I just want to get in one last question.   Your argument is that the FHFA is unconstitutionally structured given this Court's decision in Seila Law. I see vast differences between the FHFA and the F -- CFPB.   The FHFA's most notable power and the reason we are here today is that they can put certain government-affiliated companies under conservatorship. Conservatorships are -- are never thought of, in my experience, as an executive power.   It's historically been an adjunct to the judicial power.   So why isn't that -- and -- and this is not a wide-reaching power that affects many entities.   It's one company at a time essentially, unlike in the CFPB.   So why can't we say that this is an exception to Humphrey's Estate or Morrison versus Olson? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Briefly, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " The question is whether it's significant executive power, and the authority to decide whether to put Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship or receivership, a decision that affects the entire mortgage market and thus the home equity of every homeowner in this country, is unquestionably a significant executive power. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan.   Justice Kagan? "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Sorry. Mr. Mooppan, can I take you back to your answers to Justice Alito? If -- if I understood you right, you said that the only final action that's being challenged here is the Third Amendment.   So I'm going to repeat his question to you because I -- I wasn't quite sure I got your answer. If that's the case, that that's the only final action challenged here, what basis would we have to do anything more than issue a -- a -- a declaratory judgment about the validity of that amendment? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So I don't think you have it quite right.   The plaintiffs in this case did seek a declaratory judgment that the structure of the FH -- FHFA was unconstitutional, and the Fifth Circuit granted them that relief.   And there is a cert petition that raises -- that was granted that includes that question.   So we do think it would be appropriate for this Court to confirm that that aspect of the judgment is correct. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I know that they asked for it, but usually, if you bring an APA challenge, you know, you have to point to a final agency action that you think is wrong in some sense.   And -- and, here, the Third Amendment was done by the acting director.   If you are right about that, it doesn't raise the removal issues.   So what does raise the removal issues? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So it's just like Free Enterprise Fund, Your Honor.   They are entitled to bring a prospective suit saying that the ongoing regulatory power of the agency over them, even absent a concrete final agency action, they could seek prospective relief against that because, of course, the FHFA, as a regulator, has the authority to decide whether these entities will continue to be in conservatorship or not or whether they could be put into receivership.   They -- the shareholders here have the ability to say that that decision should be made only by a regulator that's constitutionally structured, just like -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You're saying that -- you're saying that that's true even if they are not -- they're not pointing to any particular actions in the period when there was a confirmed director that they object to? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Well, it's a prospective suit, Your Honor, so it -- their -- their point is that every regulatory decision FHFA makes going forward, including, most obviously, most importantly, whether to keep the entities in conservatorship or receivership, just like in -- in Free Enterprise Fund, the Court allowed a prospective suit even though, by then, the investigation was basically done. The -- the point is that you got a regulator and a regulated entity or the shareholders of a regulated entity can bring a claim to say that that regulator is unconstitutionally structured as a prospective matter.   But you are right -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Thank you -- "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " -- and -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- Mr. Mooppan. Thanks.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I -- I guess, counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused at this declaratory judgment as to -- with respect to future actions, it seems to me like it would be appropriate for hanging on the wall but not much else.   The plaintiffs here have sought declaratory judgment in aid of further remedies retro- -- retroactive remedies that might actually do them some good, and -- and -- and that's the Third Amendment. And I guess I'm a little confused why we wouldn't proceed to hold that the Third Amendment was void from the beginning by virtue of the appointments clause problem.   It's pretty much what we did in Lucia, as you'll recall, where -- where we vacated the -- the ALJ's decision.   Why wouldn't we do the same here? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M.

That claim is clearly wrong on the merits because it -- the Third Amendment was signed by the Treasury secretary, who is before -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So it's a merits -- a merits determination then?

Isn't that a degree of speculation that is quite beyond us? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M.

And -- and what do we do again, just to return to my fundamental question, is why isn't this void?

Why wouldn't the same be true here? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M.

"}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Yes.   So I -- I would like to talk a little bit about the acting director point because I think it is an important point and it avoids some of Justice Gorsuch's concerns about the Treasury secretary's side. The statute does not expressly provide that the acting director is subject to the same clause protections as the confirmed director, and this Court should not read a statute to create constitutional problems.   It normally reads statutes to avoid constitutional problems. So the -- an easy solution that avoids all the concerns about structural error and speculation and all the rest is to simply say that under this statute, the acting director, who is the official who took this decision on behalf of HF -- FHFA is, in fact, removable at will by the President, and so there's no problem to begin with. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Is that true of all acting officials? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " It -- you know, I'd have to look at any given statute to tell you the answer, Your Honor, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, I guess, is it true -- is -- is your principle that you're asserting there that acting officials are presumptively removable at will by the President unless the statute with respect to the acting director or acting official himself or herself specifically puts restrictions on the removable -- removability? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Yes, I -- I -- I -- I -- our general position is that you should not leapfrog from any clause restriction for a confirmed official and assume that that extends to an acting official.   You would have to always look at the provisions that govern the acting official and see whether there is a removal restriction for them.   That's both as a matter of constitutional avoidance and as a matter of the Shurtleff clear statement requirement and as a matter of simple common sense. You know, Congress might have very good reasons for why it wouldn't impose a removal restriction on an acting official than it did for a confirmed official, namely, that the Senate has actually confirmed the person, so then, at that point, they might be willing to give them tenure protection.   But someone that has never gone through the gauntlet of Senate confirmation, Congress might well be unwilling to provide them with tenure protection. So both as a matter of text and common sense and structural constitutional provisions and constitutional avoidance, you shouldn't read the statute to create a constitutional problem, let alone to set aside a multibillion dollar contract. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, those are good points, and I guess the one point that's in tension with that is that Congress also designated it an independent agency, and if the official, even though acting, running it is removable at will, the agency's no longer independent. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So I'll make two points about that, Your Honor. The first is that Congress often designates agencies as -- as an independent establishment even when they're concededly not subject to any clause restrictions at all.   The best example of that I can give you is if you look at Swan versus Clinton, the agency there was described as independent, but an earlier iteration of that agency was removable expressly at will by the President. The second point I would make is that the fact that the agency is independent, even if it had said something about clause restrictions, it's one thing to say that they're independent when they've got a confirmed director.   It doesn't necessarily mean that they're independent when they have an acting director. And we know that for this statute itself because, if you look at this statute, before the first confirmed director, there was a transitional period and the head of the FHFA during that transitional period was an officer in HUD who was not subject to any clause restriction.

He had the -- there was no constitutional problem with it. Let's say that we also agree with you that there was a problem with the confirmed director because he was removable only for cause.   So the confirmed director was administering the Third Amendment, administering the conservatorship, and passing along all the earnings from the GSEs into the Treasury. Would that create a structural problem because even though perhaps the Third Amendment at its inception was valid, could the administering of the Third Amendment by an unconstitutional executive official contaminate it with structural errors such that the whole Third Amendment would have to be set aside? "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " I don't think so, Your Honor, because, again, the only -- there's not some discretionary decision within the Third Amendment other than perhaps whether the dividends that are owed are paid in cash or instead paid as a liquidation preference, neither of which would do the plaintiffs here any good, and that's not the claim that they're bringing.   Their claim isn't that the Third Amendment is valid, but the money should all be paid in liquidation preferences.   Their claim is that the Third Amendment itself should be set aside. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well, so who decides when the Third Amendment -- when this arrangement should come to an end, if ever? Because, you know, Treasury viewed it as winding down the GSEs, winding down their assets, although, you know, it's been characterized not as a receivership but as a conservatorship. Could the confirmed director have said, okay, listen, now this is no longer serving to make the GSEs solvent, and so it's time to shift arrangements? Did the confirmed director have that authority under the Third Amendment. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So, yes, just like the Second Amendment and the First Amendment and everything else that the agency does.

This is shifting gears to the distinction between direct and derivative suits.

They've suffered a pocketbook injury.   You haven't contended, I don't think, that they're not within the zone of interest of the statute.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Briefly, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " Because the APA doesn't displace traditional corporate law.   It incorporates it.

"}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You have a minute to wrap up, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " The Third Amendment should not be set aside.   If the APA's prejudicial error rule means anything at all, courts cannot set aside a multibillion dollar contract on the ground that it was unconstitutionally insulated from presidential supervision even though both of the officials who signed it were removable at will by the President. If the Recovery Act's anti-injunction clause means anything at all, courts cannot set aside a conservator's renegotiation of complex financial obligations by second-guessing the conservator's statutory exercise of business judgment.   And in all events, the Recovery Act's succession clause bars both claims. No change in the history of the APA or American corporation law appears to allow a shareholder to claim direct rather than derivative injury merely because the corporation's assets allegedly were dissipated unlawfully to another shareholder. Accordingly, this Court should reject the challenges to the Third Amendment but uphold the determination that the FHFA director's removal restriction is unconstitutional yet severable.

Nielson", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is a very easy way to answer the constitutional question in this case.   The Court should hold that unless Congress says so in a statute, an acting director does not have tenure full stop. I agree with the Solicitor General on this in all respects but one.   Because an acting director is removable at will, this part of the case should be over.   As the United States explained below, plaintiffs do not, in fact, challenge ongoing action by the FHFA.   That, rather than the government's latest position, is correct.   I urge the Court to read J.A. 117. There is no reference to any prospective suit or anything like that in the complaint here. If the Court chooses to tackle the harder question, it should still reverse. First, for the reasons this Court gave in Seila Law, the FHFA does not wield significant executive power because it does not regulate purely private actors.   Even the Department of Justice concedes that conservatorship is not an exercise of executive power. By itself, this is another reason to reverse.   Regardless, neither party undermines Seila Law's observation that the FHFA isn't in the same league as the CFPB when it comes to liberty. Second, the Court should focus on the actual text of the statute, which the parties essentially ignored.   Neither party meaningfully disputes that for cause provides the weakest protection in removal law and can easily be read to allow removal based on policy disagreement with the President.   The parties say that even that is unconstitutional. But their argument makes a hash out of the take care clause, and it would also have far-reaching consequences.   Under their logic, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Special Counsel, the Federal Reserve, the civil service, will all be subject to constitutional attack, and that's just the beginning.   Neither party offers this Court a coherent mind. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   I'd like to give -- get your take on the question a number of my colleagues have been asking.   Say I agree with you that the acting director is constitutional because removable at will and he enters into the Third Amendment, but the Third Amendment provides for payments in an ongoing way and including payments under a -- a -- a regular director who is -- is not constitutionally appointed. How does that work? What are the consequences, particularly for the payments that take place under the jurisdiction of the unconstitutionally appointed director? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron L.

There is not ongoing discretion that might affect the interests of the plaintiffs here.   It's a contract, and that contract is -- is what governs. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

That would be action by the regular director and, certainly, it would seem to me could be challengeable under the -- given that unconstitutionality. "}, {"speaker": "Aaron L. Nielson", "text": " Well, I guess two points, Your Honor. First, nothing like that is in the complaint.   There's no complaint about this taint theory.   So, you know, this is all hypothetical. But, beyond that, this isn't an ordinary agency action where you could, like, file a petition for rulemaking or something like that.

Now they do -- I know you want to keep us at the -- sort of the initial stage of Amendment III, or the Third Amendment, but there are -- as Justice Barrett noted, what about the administration of it now?

It's on page J.A. 117 is the relevant count, and there's no ongoing taint theory here, so all of this is hypothetical. But, again, this is a contract, and with a contract, sure, you might be unhappy with it, but it was entered into by a conservator who wasn't even exercising executive power, and the FHFA as regulator can't just undo a contract. It takes a decision from the FHFA and the Treasury Department.

I mean, there's -- there's not much that those two opinions agreed on, but this seems to be one of them, that, you know, the FHFA makes rules, it conducts enforcement actions, it has subpoena power.

I think you're always safe going with the majority, and the majority says that it's not a lot of power. But your point is well taken.   I think the way that you reconcile the dissent and the majority is the dissent is saying, look how much effect it has in the real world, and the majority is saying, but look at how much power it actually exercises. The difference between this agency and the CFPB is the CFPB has vast discretion, whereas, if you go through the statute here, it's true they can do certain things but only in a very, very limited way.   Congress has essentially said, here is the instruction manual, go forth and do it. And for something as reticulated as that, if the agency doesn't do it correctly, the President can say that's cause.   That's the easiest type of cause there is.   You're supposed to have a report.

A -- a lot of your remedial argument seems to hinge on the happenstance that we had an acting director at the time of the Third Amendment's adoption.   I -- I'd like to highlight two potential difficulties with that and ask for your thoughts. The first is the assumption that the acting director is answerable to the President while the director is not.   Under the statute creating this outfit, the director appoints deputy directors, the director, not the President.   It appears that those deputy directors would be insulated from the President therefore. And when -- when the director steps aside, he names the acting director, or, rather, he gives a pool of three of his deputies and the President chooses which of those three.   But the director appointed all three of them. So I'm not sure in what sense or where we get the inference or how we generate from some penumbra emanating somewhere that the President has the removal power over this acting director.   That's one. And two is, let's -- let's box in that, let's assume that's the case.   So what? The -- the plaintiffs here challenged actions after -- during this whole period, including after a period in which the acting director disappeared and we now have a director. You say, well, that -- that -- that doesn't matter because the amendment is a thing that was adopted by the acting director.   But the plaintiffs are challenging the director's actions as void because he is unanswerable to the President. So why wouldn't we at least be able to provide relief voiding the director's actions once we had a -- a -- a Senate-confirmed director in 2014? "}, {"speaker": "Aaron L. Nielson", "text": " Well, that -- that's a lot to answer.   I'll do my best. As to the acting point, the -- the premise of the other side's argument is that the Vacancies Act doesn't apply.   I don't see the basis for that.   That's not consistent with how courts have read it in analogous circumstances. But even beyond that, merely because -- assuming that the President could only pick among those three, that says nothing about whether the President can remove them. Ordinarily, the power to designate includes the power to undesignate, and, here, the statute says nothing whatsoever to prevent the ordinary operation of -- of that background principle. As to the \"so what,\" I would point the Court again to J.A. 117, which is the actual complaint here.   There isn't this ongoing theory that, you know, we're challenging a -- a future action.   All they were challenging was the Third Amendment. You know, you could maybe make an argument that the Third Amendment should be, you know, undone or something like that, but that's not even pleaded, and the idea that agency inaction or, you know, merely defending something that was constitutional when done becomes unconstitutional really has no limiting principle.

One of the arguments that the other side makes is that the President could use the acting to try to get away from ever having Senate confirmation, and that -- there -- there's two reasons why that isn't so. One is that Congress has many tools to try to stop presidential shenanigans like that. But, more than that, there is an appointments clause backstop to all of this.   The head of an agency is supposed to be a Senate-confirmed officer.   You can have a temporary, non- -- you know, non-Senate-confirmed officer heading an agency, but the appointments clause is a firm backstop against that kind of chicanery that the -- that the -- the plaintiff posits.

The Court focused on two things, whether private citizens are being regulated and whether there is substantial policy discretion. Here, no one's talked about the point that the Court said in Seila Law that the FHFA does not regulate purely private actors.   We're not talking about the same sort of, you know, course of power of the state that the CFPB wields. Likewise, Congress has tightly reticulated what this agency can do.   It's like an instruction manual.

FHFA abandoned its conservatorship mission when it imposed the Net Worth Sweep. And the claim that only FHFA may sue FHFA for nationalizing Fannie and Freddie is contrary to this Court's decision in American Power, decades of precedent on the lenient zone-of-interest test, and the strong presumption favoring judicial review of agency action.   Congress enacted the APA to make judicial review widely available to anyone who is aggrieved within the meaning of a relevant statute.   And shareholders are aggrieved by the Net Worth Sweep. But even under ordinary principles of state corporation law, our claims may proceed because they are direct.   There are two distinct injuries caused by the Net Worth Sweep, one suffered by the companies, which cannot rebuild capital and return to a sound condition, and another suffered by private shareholders who were moved -- were removed from the companies' capital structures. To see this, consider a hypothetical Third Amendment that required the companies to pay their net worth to plaintiffs rather than Treasury.   That action would have injured the companies no less than the real Third Amendment, but it would not have visited an injury on plaintiffs. The Net Worth Sweep needlessly dissipated the assets of the companies FHFA is charged with rehabilitating.

They're worth something, presumably, largely based on judgments about what the future holds. So doesn't that run -- render your sort of nationalization rhetoric just that, rhetoric? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " No, Your Honor, in -- in the sense of there's no scenario under the Third Amendment in which we will be able to recover any economic value. It's true that there's value in the shares, but that's attributable to two factors, number one, this lawsuit, and, number two, that there is ongoing political discussion about what to do with these companies, and maybe one day in the future the government will abandon the Net Worth Sweep.   But, right now, it's in force and effect, and the companies have been nationalized. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, putting aside the loss -- lawsuit answer, the future does seem to me to suggest that there is still value in your shares.   Now it may be a gamble on the future, but that's -- that has value in itself.

That's an important driver, obviously, in the value of the stock.   But, in terms of the lifeline, Your Honor, I -- I would just point out that the Net Worth Sweep exposed that line of commitment to maximum vulnerability because the companies can never build up capital to absorb losses. So, if there had not been a Net Worth Sweep, there would be 124 billion dollars of capital on the balance sheet today standing between future losses and the line of commitment.   The -- the Net Worth Sweep took away that ability to rebuild capital and has exposed that lifeline to maximum vulnerability. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

We calculate those overpayments to be 124 billion dollars, and each one of those overpayments was an implementation of the Net Worth Sweep.   So that theme really runs throughout our complaint. We also complain about how, over time, the -- the commitment itself has been exposed to vulnerability, and so the implementation issues are important, and that's one of the reasons on J.A. 118 why we ask for an injunction in the future so that there aren't any more dividend payments to the Treasury at the expense of the private shareholders.

One of the things that's pernicious about this structure is it reduced the President in -- in the real world to the cajoler in chief where this was, as one of my friends on the other side said, it takes two to tango.   And so this wasn't a reflection of the what the President wanted.   It was a reflection of what the President was able to negotiate. In your hypothetical, Justice Thomas, if they were all to have done that simultaneously on day one, that might have changed things.   But the other thing to realize is, if we were creating a but-for world in which there was no for-cause removal protection, we'd have to go back to the beginning of the agency, at least to the beginning of the Obama Administration, and see how the companies and the conservator were different in 2012 at the time of the sweep.

And if you do the math, the government's been paid back in toto plus 10 percent interest, and there's 29.5 billion dollars left over. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals asked the parties to address three questions.

And the director says, I agree, and I will conduct myself on that understanding, and, in fact, I will verify every single morning that you still want me in office and you don't, as a matter of whim, want me to leave.

Federal courts aren't well suited to psychoanalyzing coordinate branches of government and what they would do in a hypothetical world, and so where it's hard to measure the effects -- and that's particularly true here, where, again, it was a negotiation between a Republican appointee and the Obama Administration, and they had had bitter disputes throughout the three years that Mr. DeMarco was there.

It does seem counterintuitive, perhaps illogical, to say that assuming you're right that the FHFA director must be removable at will, why you should get anything more than a gen -- than a declaratory judgment to that effect. First, the argument is that this decision was entered into by two entities under the complete control of the President.   There is no dispute that the Treasury had -- treasurer is removable at will.   So we know what the President would have wanted because he had an agency he fully and unequivocally controlled entering this agreement. And then, secondly, we have an acting director, which almost logically means that he could be removable entering it. Second, no President has ever tried to remove the director, acting or otherwise.

"}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Your Honor, respectfully, we don't know what the President wanted.   We know the President was willing to sign this deal; otherwise, the Secretary of Treasury wouldn't have signed it. But, as my friends on the other side said, it took two to tango.   This was a negotiation, and it was a negotiation with a Republican appointee with whom things -- relationships had gotten so bad that on our red brief at page 72 we point out there was open calls for him to be fired, and the administration said he's an acting director and we can't fire him. And, presumably, that's because of 4511(a) that says it shall be an independent agency of the federal government.   And under this interpretation that the acting director can be fired, it would toggle back from being a radically independent agency to a radically dependent agency. My friend on the other side points to the Swan case.   But, there, that was the NCUA and there were three Board members, and the fact that one of them became dependent didn't transform the agency radically. Here, when you have a single director and you say that the acting director can be fired at -- at will, then you just radically transform the nature of it. In addition, even if I'm wrong about that, under 4512(f), the President's hand -- hands are handcuffed in terms of whom he can designate, and we do challenge the actions of the regulator. So, for all of those reasons, we -- we're entitled to relief.   Certainly, backward-looking relief was given in the Bowsher case as well.

And the Court said these employees aren't within the zone of interest. But, here, it is different because it's highly protective of shareholders' rights. We see that in the rehabilitative mission of the conservator.   We see that in receivership, where there's a priority scheme as to how the money can be distributed.   And we see that in the preserve and conserve mandate.   And we see that in 4617(b)(11)(e), which requires the conservator to maximize the net present value of asset sales.

I'll put some scary sounding numbers on this. The SSA has been led by a single commissioner since 1994 and ever since then, it's rendered 650,000 decisions every year, so that's about 17 million decisions. Now you told Justice Alito, well, maybe there are some exceptions for lower-level employees.   I'm not sure that ALJs would qualify as that, and even if they do, let's assume, which I think is probably true, that all of those decisions are rendered pursuant to guidance and rules that the SSA commissioner has enforced. So are we really going to void all of those decisions? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Well, Your Honor, a few points.   Number one, there's the statute of limitations and the Article III limitations. There's also the fact that the SSAA is different than the FHFA.   We don't think it makes a constitutional difference, but it -- it has much more limited jurisdiction.   It's not running multi-trillion dollar companies. And so, to the extent the Court wants to try to preserve the Social Security Administration, it could potentially try to do that.   We don't think it should.   We agree with the Solicitor General that it's unconstitutional and that, yes, its actions over the last -- within the statute of limitations should be void if -- if done by principal officers.

The -- the first is that once we had a new director in 2014, we -- we've heard a suggestion that -- that you haven't complained about actions taken after 2014 in your complaint, and the only complaint has to do with the entry into the Third Amend -- Amendment, which took place during the pendency of a prior director.   I'd like your -- I'd like to understand your thoughts about that first.

"}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   So, on the first question, we do complain about the implementation.   We are complaining about each and every one of the decisions under the Net Worth Sweep by the director.   Every one of these dividend payments gets declared quarterly, and none of them can be paid to the Treasury under 12 C.F.R. 1237.12(a) and (b) unless the director blesses those. And so we've complained in the complaint that, but for each and every one of those payments, there'd be 124 billion dollars of extra capital at the company.   Obviously, the implication of that calculation in our complaint is we're not satisfied that any of these payments were made. Now, as for the Court's second question, with respect to ratification, we don't believe this could be ratified, in large part because, if the government is coming in and trying to justify this by saying, well, there was a death spiral, we didn't know the companies were going to do so well, well, now we know.

But the Solicitor General says those cases show only that vacatur is permissible in an appropriate case, not that it is mandatory in every case and that those principles I've just mentioned can apply.   Your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Well, number one, they haven't invoked, for example, the de facto officer doctrine.   They haven't invoked that in this Court, so they -- they have waived that. The only thing they -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " No, you -- your reaction to the general catalogue of principles outlined by the Solicitor General. "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " I don't believe that it applies in a case brought under the APA. Obviously, many of the older precedents before 1946 and even some after weren't under the APA. But, when the APA says \"shall set aside\" with due account for the rule of prejudicial error, that sweeps aside these equitable doctrines and tells this Court that it shall set aside. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And then switching gears on the -- some of the arguments made by the amicus, the forceful arguments made in distinguishing Seila Law and other precedents, I want to get your reaction to a couple of those. The amicus points out that Seila Law used the phrase \"significant executive power.\" Your response to that? Was that a descriptor, descriptive language, or -- or is that a necessary condition before we can say that a for-cause removal restriction on an executive officer is unconstitutional? The amicus says the latter. "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " We certainly did not understand this Court to be creating a sliding scale which would require lower courts to go and try to figure out how much is a significant executive power versus not.   We -- we -- so we did not understand it to be establishing a legally required standard.   If it were, there's certainly significant executive authority being -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " -- exercised -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Sorry, can I stop you there? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Please. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Another distinction that the amicus points out is that the \"for cause\" language here is not the same. "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " That's true, but Wiener tells us what the term \"for cause\" means, and it says rectitude, which is moral failing.   So it's different, but, in some ways, it's even a higher standard than what was before the Court in Seila Law.   Moral failing is a smaller subset than neglect and malfeasance. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And then the amicus says, on -- on a different front, that the implications for other agencies could be significant and that the Court could not limit its holding here to single-director independent agencies and leave those for another day, whether those follow or not would still be an open issue.   Do you -- what's your reaction to amicus's point that this would necessarily carry over into multi-member agencies, at least with chair designations and things like that? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " We -- we disagree with that, Your Honor.   We think we fall comfortably within the -- the Seila Law framework and there would be no reason for the Court to go back and redo that framework.   So -- so we disagree with it. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Barrett. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Thompson, I want to just make sure I understand the thrust of your argument for structural error.   Let's assume that we think that the acting director was removable at will, there was no constitutional problem with the acting director. And let's further imagine that the acting director is the one who was in charge for -- say, you know, up until six months ago, up until last year, and then we had a confirmed director. Does that mean that everything that happened in the course of the Third Amendment is then void as structurally invalid because, at some point, a constitutionally invalid officer entered the scene? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Well, Your Honor, if -- if it was an acting director and all -- all of our arguments are rejected about 4512(f) as well, and so that the Court concludes there was no structural problem whatsoever at the agency until just six months ago, certainly, we would complain about the last six months' worth of payments.   But this is a -- it's been many years that there's been a Senate-confirmed director. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " No, no, no, no.   I understand that.   I'm just trying to figure out how much participation by the unconstitutional officer matters, I mean, because, here, we didn't have constant, 100 percent of the time, control by a confirmed director.   But you're arguing, I mean, and -- and I'm saying let's assume that we think the acting director posed no problem, if the Third Amendment was entered into by the acting director with no constitutional problem, you're still saying that the participation of the confirmed director was a structural error that invalidated the Third Amendment and everything with it, correct? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Well, it cert -- certainly, it -- it -- it affected the implementation, yes, Your Honor.   That would invalidate any implementation by that illegal director -- illegally constituted director. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But only for those periods.   It wouldn't actually throw the whole thing out, it would just invalidate those actions taken by the confirmed director? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " I -- I think that is a fair point that the director can only be -- you know, their actions can be invalidated -- you know, the -- the director's actions that he took could be invalidated but not his predecessor if what his predecessor had done was totally permissible. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " And so we would then have to parse through and figure out what was done by the constitutionally problematic officer and what was fine because it was done by the acting director? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Well, if -- and, again, it's a big if -- if the Court concludes there's no problem with 4512(f), then the Court would want to look to see what did the director do, and that stretches back to 2014, these approvals. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " And -- and let me just -- I just want to be under -- certain that I understand what you're asking for.   Are you asking us, say, if we agreed with you on the whole thing, do you want an injunction ordering Treasury to pay back the billions of dollars? "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " No -- no -- no, Your Honor.   So this is very important.   We're seeking two things.   Number one, we're seeking prospective relief so that -- that in your hypothetical the Senate-confirmed director would be enjoined from making any future sweep dividend, approving any future sweep dividend payment; and, number two, we're asking to go back and have the overpayments, over and above the 18.9 billion dollars, to be treated as a pay-down of principal.   And that would essentially deem the government paid back. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " A minute to wrap up, Mr. Thompson. "}, {"speaker": "David H. Thompson", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. For decades, federal conservators and receivers have exercised powers under statutory schemes that are indistinguishable from the one at issue here.   Yet no conservator or receiver has ever been before -- before been permitted to operate its ward for the exclusive benefit of the federal government. And so I will close with the words of Mark Calabria, FHFA's current director: \"Fair and predictably applied insolvency rules allow investors and creditors to judge the risks of investing in a company.   If that process can be manipulated to favor one creditor, as FHFA has favored Treasury, then there is no basis to judge what could happen if a company fails. Given the important role that government bodies play in the resolution of many financial institutions, it is essential that the performance of this role assure all stakeholders of fairness and predictability.\" We agree.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Mooppan. "}, {"speaker": "Hashim M. Mooppan", "text": " So my colleague hasn't shown any presidential insulation on either side of the Third Amendment.   With respect to the acting director, he hasn't shown any reason why this Court would construe the statute to create a constitutional problem rather than to avoid one. The only point he really made was to say that once the acting director was removed by the President at will, the President had limited options for who could replace him.   That's not a problem about presidential removal, it's not the claim they made, and it's actually not even correct because the FVRA is available. On the other side of the transaction, it's undisputed and indisputable that the Treasury Secretary signed the agreement and, of course, is removable at will by the President. His only argument on that side is to say, well, maybe the contract wouldn't have happened because of other things that happened earlier. But that can't be right either because, on that theory, the agency could never act going forward.   Think about, for example, the CFPB.   On his theory, even though this Court has said that the CFPB is now removable at will, the CFPB can take no further action going forward because someone could always walk into court and say, well, the circumstances would have been different if they hadn't been subject to a removable restriction in the past. That's not the way this Court's judicial review works.   The question is what -- whether the agency action that's being challenged was insulated from the President. And, here, because the Secretary of the Treasury and the acting director are the ones who entered into the Third Amendment, it was. So then, if we assume the Third Amendment is valid as a constitutional matter, his fallback argument is to suggest, well, the implementation of the Third Amendment at least can be challenged.   And the reason that doesn't work is because, once the Third Amendment is valid, the money is owed. The only question is how the money is paid.   Is it paid in cash, or is it paid in liquidation? I point the Court to J.A. 179 and 180, which says: \"To the extent not paid, pursuant to Section 2A, dividends on shares shall accrue and shall be added to the liquidation preference whether or not the funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not dividends are declared.\" A simple analogy that makes the point, imagine a cabinet secretary entered into a contract to buy a property then -- and would pay for -- for five years a million dollars a year. And then imagine two years in Congress imposed a removal restriction.   No one would say that the -- the last three years' worth of payments could be challenged. That money is owed as a legal matter under a valid contract, and there's no actual executive or discretionary decision being made in paying the money that's legally owed. Finally, on the anti-injunction clause, which we didn't have too much time to discuss this morning, I guess the key point I would try to make is that this wasn't a nationalization; it was a renegotiation of dividend obligation.   And as all the courts of appeals before the court below recognized, and as Judge Stras and Judge Bevis explained, the Court shouldn't second-guess that under the anti-injunction clause.
