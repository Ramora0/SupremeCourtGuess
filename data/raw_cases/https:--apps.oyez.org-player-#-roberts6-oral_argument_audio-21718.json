Horne", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:   I would like to start picking up on a question asked by Justice Ginsburg on the Rees case.   The Rees case is pre-AEDPA.   If there is one thing that Congress had in mind when it passed AEDPA, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, it is that the death penalty process needs to be speeded up, and habeas should not result in undue delays to give effect-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You don't think that AEDPA would alter the outcome of Rees?

"}, {"speaker": "Thomas C. Horne", "text": " Yes, I agree, Your Honor, but I thought it would be relevant to point out that it was pre-AEDPA.   And then, on that point, this Court has said several times that habeas should not be used to grant indefinite stays.   In fact, even pre-AEDPA, in the Barefoot case, this Court said that habeas is not a time to retry a case, and even less is it a time to grant indefinite stays.   So the sentence with, \u201c even less \u201d, followed the sentence with, \u201c not \u201d.   So it was even less than not that it should grant permanent stays.

In the American Psychiatric brief, I think it's page 10, note 20, they said that up to 90 percent of the cases are solved in six to nine months.   And I think that if this Court set a standard of no more than a year for the successive stays, that would give some guidance to the courts.

In fact, this Court has said the purposes of AEDPA include finality, comity, federalism, and reduction of delays in death sentence cases.   There needs to be a balance between that and the need to have a competent defendant, if we can have one, in a case where the testimony is necessary.   This Court has said several times -- I was going to mention also the Heinze case, where this Court thinks that -- very clearly that stays cannot be indefinite.   So I think it would be very helpful for this Court to give a guideline to the courts and say, the way to balance this is that if they get the time in which 90 percent of the cases are-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But those cases didn't establish a limit on how long states needed to take to adjudicate claims.

I'd like to provide the Court with a practical example of how a limited stay might work, since that seems to have been of some concern.   An analogous Federal statute is 18 U.S.C. section 4241, the Federal competency hearing statute that the Court cited or provided a CF citation to in Rees.   That provides the framework for how a district court determines competency for a prisoner to stand trial and could provide a framework for how a district court should proceed with competency hearings in a case where it would be appropriate.   Under section 4241 the criminal defendant, if he is found incompetent, the district court may give an initial period of up to 4 months for him to be treated to determine whether he can come back to competency.   If he cannot regain his competency at the end of that 4-month period, then the court can grant an additional reasonable extension of that time if the doctors say that there is a reasonable probability that this prisoner can be restored to competence.   That could provide a framework, if that's what this Court is looking to do, for showing district courts how they could enter a limited stay.

They do it whenever a competency motion is filed in a Federal criminal trial, and we agree with the -- the outside limit of about a year.   It depends on the -- the interests at stake, the interests at stake in the State in proceeding with its judgment and the interests in finality and whether the doctors think that there's actually a chance that this prisoner could be restored to competence if they work a little harder.   If the -- if the evidence is crucial or necessary or there's some indication that we want to work hard to get this information from the prisoner, we would go for a little bit longer.   But at some point, that attempt to restore the prisoner to competency has to end and the -- and the proceedings should move forward based on the best evidence that's available. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Ms. O'Connell, where does that outer limit come from?   You suggested looking to that statute as an analogy, but there would be no outer limit in application of that statute, would there? "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " There's not.   But -- but at some point we do give up, and the district courts have discretion to determine how long that would be, and -- and again, we propose an outer limit of about a year, but it's up to the district court in that particular circumstance to see how hard they want to work to try to get that evidence into the proceeding.

That's because when we arrive at post-conviction proceedings, we have a conviction and a sentence that have been affirmed on direct appeal and are presumed to be valid, and although it's a valid consideration for the district court to take into account whether the prisoner is competent and could assist his counsel has a role in these proceedings, there's no right for the prisoner to be competent during the post-conviction proceedings.

"}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " --Justice Ginsburg, we think that it would not be an abuse of discretion for the district court to allow the defendant to try to regain his competence and help his lawyer with the proceedings if there is some opportunity for him to present evidence or to present new claims in his proceeding.   That may be the case.   It will often be the case for a section 2255 petitioner.   It is his first round of Federal post-conviction proceedings.   It may be his first opportunity to present an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.   And in those circumstances, if he has something that -- if the lawyer has something that he wants the prisoner's assistance with or may need testimony from -- from the prisoner, we think the district court has discretion to allow a stay, a limited stay to allow the prisoner to regain his competence.

In those cases, we think that no stay is appropriate, that it would be an abuse of discretion to enter a stay.   AEDPA doesn't tolerate delay without a justification, and if it's a record-based claim like a State prisoner where he's barred by section 2254(d) in Pinholster from bringing in new evidence and that the review is strictly limited to the State court record, then there is no role for the prisoner to play and it would be an abuse of discretion for the district court to stay the proceedings in an effort to bring him back.

But what we would do is direct the Court to this Court's decision in Rhines, where stays were -- where district courts are allowed to -- to stay a proceeding so that the petitioner could -- could go back to State court and exhaust.   And in -- in that decision, the Court was specific as to guidelines for the district court to assert its discretion.   30-day updates, make sure that clients are not -- are not being dilatory in seeking these stays, and so forth.

Always there is a question of competency, and then the courts are looking to whether or not there is essentiality.

Would there be any obligation to begin the treatment prior to the -- to the time when the motion for a stay is -- is filed?   Could many years go by with the same attorney representing a client, and then at the very last minute -- and no effort is made to obtain treatment that would restore the petitioner to competency, and then at the very last minute, a motion for a stay is entered, and then this period of time -- 6 months, 9 months, a year, whatever it is -- would begin to run?

At that point, Mr. Gonzales was back in State court exhausting issues and raising Ring claims.   In that court -- in the State and district court -- in that court, his post-conviction counsel raised ineffective assistance -- I'm sorry, competency issues -- and it was -- and it was an incompetency to assist in post-conviction -- post-conviction -- and that claim was denied.

I need to disagree with the Solicitor General on one point about the standard.   The standard has to be essentiality.   The witness has to be essential.   In fact, you heard my friend representing Gonzales emphasize essentiality, and it was emphasized in their -- in their responsive brief at pages 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 30, and 39.

One is how tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all, and the other is what limits there should be on how long a stay can be if a stay is warranted.   And I'm just curious, if I forced you to prioritize in terms of the state's interests in effective habeas adjudication, which is more important, you know, cranking up the standard, or making sure that there is a time limit in place?

Horne", "text": " Well, I think the first -- the first priority is that there should be no indefinite stay, and the second priority is that there should be no stay in a records-based case.

It's in the district court's order, Appendices B and C to our -- to our petition.   And even the Ninth Circuit didn't argue that.   The Ninth Circuit argued that there was an issue as to whether there was prejudice by the judge.   But there is a very detailed analysis, again, in the district court's order, showing that every time that claim was made, and was claim -- made a number of times in the state proceedings, it was clear that those were on-the-record comments.   There was nothing secret.   There was nothing ex parte.   Those were on-the-record discussions that were being complained about.   And the district court judge found that if there was something secret, then those have been waived by the petitioner because he didn't bring it up in the numerous case -- times that it came up at the state level, and he was talking only about on-the-record comments by the trial judge.
