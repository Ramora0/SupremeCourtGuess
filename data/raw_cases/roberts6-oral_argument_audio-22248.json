Millett", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The -- the court of appeals in this case had jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal, but in doing so it decided the case wrongly.   Mr. Gonzalez's petition for habeas corpus was timely because it was filed within a year of the conclusion of direct appellate proceedings in the State court, and at the -- within a year of that court's ending of his appeal process.   With respect to jurisdiction, jurisdiction existed because a certificate of appealability was issued.   It rested upon a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.   To be sure, the judge in issuing that certificate did not identify the substantial constitutional question required by 2253(c)(3).   That is a requirement.   It is mandatory, but it is not jurisdictional. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What if he had identified a constitutional issue, speedy trial issue?   Does that give the Court the authority to consider a different constitutional issue, Fourth Amendment issue? "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " Yes, it does.   Once -- this is a gatekeeping function to identify which case, which appeal should go forward and claim the attention of the Court.   But the text of the statute and 22 -- that's on page -- excuse me -- page 3a of the appendix to the blue brief.   It provides that an appeal may not go forward and the certificate of appealability may go forward.   The operative language here in (c)(1) is that this is about an appeal going forward.   So once the certificate identifies issues, the appeal goes forward.   It's much like 1292(b), where certification of questions comes to an appellate court, and they decide whether to take interlocutory review.   Once they do, they are not bound to just those questions.   The entire order comes up for review. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So what if it identifies something that is not remotely a Federal constitutional issue.

I mean, it's not issued by a clerk's office, right?   The statute requires a judge to do this, a Federal judge, circuit judge or justice -- circuit justice -- to issue this.   And these are -- these are officials who are sworn to uphold the law and the Constitution.   And when they do this, when they make these determinations, they aren't handing these out like candy; they are deciding that their court, their colleagues, maybe themselves, should invest resources in this process.   So the fact that a certificate is issued is not simply a piece of paper coming out.   I think it is fair to presume that it is a deliberate determination by a judicial officer. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Ms. Millett, suppose, instead of having a statute broken down into (c)(1), (2) and (3), Congress had written (c) as just one paragraph that says: You must have a certificate of appealability, and this is what the certificate must contain.   No division into (2) and (3).   Would you still maintain that only the first sentence of the paragraph is jurisdictional and the rest is not? "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " Well, my position would be harder for precisely the reason you phrased.   And as Justice Scalia was asking, how do we tell?   These are -- these are jobs of statutory construction, and the fact that Congress broke these two steps out and broke (c)(3) out by itself, and there is a noticeable turn in the language by the time you get to (c)(3) -- (c)(1) says \"no appeal shall be taken\".   That sounds jurisdictional.   (c)(3) says   \"a document shall indicate issues after the fact. \"   The important thing to understand here is that you not only have the language shifting materially, but you're starting presumption, the starting presumption here, is that we need a clear direction from Congress before we decide that something is jurisdictional.

That's exactly what we are talking about. "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A.

Congress could have written the statute that way, but I think it would be extraordinary to tell courts that an appeal comes forward but we are only going to allow you to look at this precise issue decided by one judge.

First of all, I mean, courts can certainly do that as a matter of discretion, but whether-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Then that would exclude this case, wouldn't it, because there is a constitutional issue.   It's the speedy trial issue.   But that issue was not reached below, because the case was dismissed as untimely.   So the only constitutional issue that's in the case is one that couldn't be adjudicated by the court of appeals.   Isn't that right?   Is there another constitutional issue other than the speedy trial issue? "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " --There -- there are other issues that were raised.   I think for our purposes that the strongest one that was most clearly substantial is the speedy trial one.   And that's the one that we identified. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It's a little odd that you would identify that issue for the court of appeals when the court of appeals couldn't take it up because it wasn't reached below, because the case was -- was dismissed at an earlier stage. "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, your question actually captures why these mistakes happen by court of appeals judges.   The court of appeals judge presumably -- and again, I'm just presuming here.   This Court's seen this mistake happen before.   And I think what -- the judge that looked at this, didn't make a determination there wasn't a substantial constitutional question, had to know that that was there.   But for the court of appeals' purposes, they are just going to sort out the procedural question, and if it's timely they are not going to address speedy trial in the first instance.   That would go back to the district court.   So that's one of the reasons I think just as a practical matter why this mistake happens sometimes, in this certificate of appealability process.   But the fundamental question here is one of statutory construction: Did Congress make clear, clear at level we require for jurisdiction, clear that we -- at the level we would require for holding -- and I've never seen this anywhere in this Court's precedents -- holding that an individual pro se prisoner who does everything reasonably possible, fully and timely complies with all obligations, will still have his right to first habeas on a substantial constitutional claim irretrievably jurisdictionally foreclosed because the court of appeals judge miswrote a certificate documenting a judgment that the officer made? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Can you -- can you make the argument -- does it help you -- in distinguishing the notice of appeals section, to -- to say that the notice of appeal had to say the judgment or order that's being appealed?   That's almost clerical.   It doesn't require any -- any discretion on the part of the judge or extensive review of the record, whereas in the COA there has to be an element of judgment in deciding what the constitutional issue is.   Does that help you distinguish the two?   You rely on the fact that the notice of appeals cases were decided before our -- our case indicating that it has to be clear language. "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " I think certainly that there is that point.   I think what's important to recognize is that there is actually a similarity between this Court's notice of appeal cases in something like Houston v. Lack, the mail -- prison mailbox rule.   You have a specific textual jurisdictional requirement in the -- in the rules, that requires filing the notice of appeal with the clerk of the district court.   And this Court said look, when it comes to prisoners who have done everything humanly possible within their control to meet the jurisdictional requirements, we are not going to interpret these rules -- as part of the presumption, we don't interpret rules to strip away jurisdiction from individuals who have done everything humanly possible, particularly when the facts on the ground are that the statute was satisfied.

There are -- you can -- you can -- there are processes for attempting to appeal single-judge orders.   Within every court of appeals, they have rules for that.   The difficulty here is that you have a pro se prisoner who thought he won.   He got something that was hard to get from a court of appeals judge and that's a certificate of appealability, and he did that by providing documentation of a substantial speedy trial claim, a speedy trial claim unlike this Court has ever seen, a 10-year gap between indictment and trial and then conviction on nothing but eyewitness testimony.   He documented that for the court, did everything he could.   And it isn't until this Court that the State says: Hang on; there was never any jurisdiction over this whole case.   They didn't tell the court of appeals judges that.   They didn't say anything until the case came to this Court.   And that type of trap-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

But if it's mandatory but not jurisdictional, then if the State moves or maybe if the court, if the panel sue sponte, identifies the fact that there may be an error, there is an opportunity for a new certificate of appealability.   If nothing is done, then -- then there isn't a problem.   It's not a jurisdictional issue that lingers forever. "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " --No, I'm sorry if I misspoke.   I absolutely agree that it's mandatory and if timely raised must be dealt with.   I think it's an open question whether if it's not raised until you're actually before the panel, whether the panel then has to identify one of its judges to issue a certificate or it can simply in the course of its opinion say we've determined that this should go forward, even though the initial -- would you have to go through a formal amendment process?   Or you just do that as part of your decision?   I think either one will accomplish the same result and will comply with the statute, the functional gatekeeping requirement.   But the separate question which your question -- your comment leads to is that in looking at this, would Congress have wanted this gatekeeping function to be subject to perpetual review and revision, obligatory perpetual review by the panel?   You couldn't accept that your colleague found that there was a substantial question; all three judges would again have to revisit that and determine that it's substantial.   This was set up as a gatekeeping requirement and it was meant to be a -- a promotion of efficiency, not to cause more work, not to cause more paperwork, to sift out cases, identify the appeals that merit the time and resources of the court.   And once that's identified, the more efficient process is not to make the certificate of appealability a whole side show, a whole other layer of processing ping-ponging back and forth between this Court, courts of appeals; courts of appeals, single judges.   We simply -- we try -- we look at this and we determine that a judgment was made by a judicial officer sworn to uphold the law; a substantial showing was made.

Millett", "text": " Two responses to that.   First, that simply begs the question that we're presenting in this case of when the direct review ended.   That's our argument in the case, is that prong.   When did that direct review prong end?   And the second -- the second aspect of this is to understand what happened in Jimenez.   The whole argument there was that you've got to -- by the State, was you're only -- you stopped -- remember, Jimenez had stopped at the intermediate court of appeals as well.   And the State's argument was you stopped at the intermediate court of appeals originally, so you are only in the expiration of review prong.   And this -- but then he went back 4 years later, I think it was, and got the court to reopen, started -- had a whole new direct review process going on.   And this Court said -- rejected the argument that because he didn't go to the intermediate court we don't look at the direct review prong, we only look at expiration or review prong.   We don't look at that.   We stop and we look to see is the State done.

And then it gives four dates essentially, four sections, each of which produces a date, A, B, C and D.   And A is the one that's concerned here.   And A says the date on which the judgment becomes final and then it gives two ways by which a judgment can become final.   And the two ways are basically you lose or you quit, right.   You lose or you abandon your process.   So, I just don't understand your argument, quite honestly, because it seems to me that A says the date, a single date, on which the judgment becomes final.

The point 2244(d)(1) in particular, but 2244(d) generally, is to say, as the Court talked about, is the State done?   This supports Federalism.

And so let's ask the questions: When did the direct review conclude-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But it does, it does suggest, Ms. Millett, that final, two ways -- conclusion of direct review is you've gone up the ladder and that's it.   And the second part is, well, if you don't go up the ladder you would stop.   Then when your time to go up the ladder has ended, that's it.

And the time ultimately is the same.   What happened in Clay -- these things are equivalent.   You have the same test.   Sometimes the outcome is different based on what the individual does and what the State law allows, but you have -- this is supposed to protect Federalism.   And the only way to protect Federalism and comity interests is to respect when the State says it's done.   To have the Federal law tell them you're done and to start the statute of limitations ruling when State law is saying we are not done, the appeal continues and do not start your State post-conviction relief, is to put Federal law at loggerheads with the State law it's supposed to be respecting.

On a statute of limitations question, this case turns on the meaning of section 2244(d)(1)(A) which first establishes the date on which the conviction, the judgment became final as a potential starting point for the one-year limitations period and then establishes two prongs for determining when that date of finality occurs.   Finality under the statute can occur either at the conclusion of direct review or it can occur at the expiration of time for seeking such review.   And Fifth Circuit correctly held that the conclusion of direct review prong applies only when the habeas applicant pursues direct review to its natural conclusion, by obtaining either a judgment or a denial of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States.   The expiration of time prong should govern all other cases, those in which the habeas applicant allows the time for seeking direct review to expire before reaching this Court.

One other point back on jurisdiction.   It's important that we emphasize we asked for this Court to vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss the appeal, but the only reason we requested a dismissal of the appeal is because Mr. Gonzalez should not get a certificate of appealability under the standards of Slack and Miller-El.

I know the record, and he has these things there.   And also, I know what they are.   Okay?   So I fill in the blanks, or the chief judge of the circuit fills in the blanks, with the panel's approval.

That's a very different inquiry. "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " --It is, and -- and once a -- a judge issues a certificate of appealability on that question it should be presumed that it's been satisfied.   What we are saying in -- when we say that (c)(2) is jurisdictional is that if it becomes-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well is it a jurisdictional rule that we're -- rule that we're going to presume that it's been satisfied?   That's a sort of odd thing to do for jurisdictional rules.   Right?   Jurisdictional rules, we sua sponte have to look at them and we have to be serious about them. "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " --Yes.   But if a -- if a district judge or a court of appeals judge has made a determination that there's a constitutional issue that's debatable, going forward that seems to be something that would be extremely hard to overturn. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So if the panel looks at the merits of constitutional issue, as to which there is a reference in the certificate of appealability when it -- when it writes its opinion it first has to ask itself, was there a substantial showing?   And if there wasn't, then it will say we'll dismiss this claim.   And then -- but if it says well, there was a substantial showing but it's wrong, then we'll affirm.   Is that -- is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " I mean.   I think that could happen.   In most cases it's not going to be an issue.   If somebody certified that it's debatable, then somebody has made that showing.   If it turns out -- like for example, if there was, if the Petitioner had said my right to testify at trial was violated; they wouldn't let me testify; and then that issue is certified and then it turns out when it gets to the merits panel that he did in fact testify and it was a totally frivolous claim -- yes, I think that the court of appeals should dismiss the case at that point for lack of jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Then let's go on to (c)(3), because (c)(3) seems to be just a documentation requirement.   In other words, let's presume that (c)(2) has been satisfied; there was a substantial showing made; and there is a documentation error and (c) -- under (c)(3).   Why should that be jurisdictional?   As sort of -- you know, there has been a substantial showing made.   There is a documentation error.   It's an error that the habeas Petitioner has absolutely no control over.   Why should we view that as a jurisdictional bar? "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " Justice Kagan, I think it's because we don't actually know that a substantial showing has been made until a Federal judge tells us that.   We could -- you know you could assume that a substantial showing was made.   It's not clear that -- that Judge Garza that or that any judge on the court of appeals thought that.

Justice Kagan, the question is whether State prisoners now should be worse off than Federal prisoners.   It is not some prisoners that will fall in this gap.   It is 99 plus percent of prisoners; because in Texas -- in Texas only about 1 percent file discretionary petitions for review.   Far less than that -- 99.7, 99.8 percent do not seek cert on direct review from this Court.   So we are now in some backwards world where we -- Clay is going to drive the rule for Federal prisoners, is going to-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I don't understand that, Miss Millett.   I mean the situation in this case is presented because the Petitioner here didn't seek review in the highest State court.   The situation is not presented because the Petitioner did not file a cert petition. "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " --Well, the question is what one means by the so-called natural conclusion of direct review.   Now statistically, this is a statutory provision written for State prisoners by Congress, to address State prisoners; and if the natural thing that happens in the world is 99 percent do not even seek review in the State's highest court.   And I'm extrapolating from Texas; I don't know all 50 States but I have no reason to think that's anomalous.   99 percent don't file petitions for discretionary review.   What kind -- why would Congress have written this statute in a way that's going to create a gap, that is going to cause prisoners who wouldn't otherwise file to now file?   Instead of 2000, they are now going to have 102,000 petitions for discretionary review, and the Texas courts-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Let me make sure I understand you.   You're saying 99 percent don't file petitions in Texas's highest court? "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " --Correct.   Correct.   And I'm -- this is -- the Texas judicial reports are -- are available on line that record this.   I'm -- I'm looking at the number of petitions each year.   Roughly the last 3 years, in the 2000-ish range.   Convictions in the State.   More than 100,000 range.   And so-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You're saying 99 percent of the -- of the defendants who take an appeal through the Texas system don't file a petition with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?   Or is it 99 percent of those who don't do that and then file a Federal habeas petition?   I would imagine it's the former, right? "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A.

They are going to have their claims unexhausted or defaulted? "}, {"speaker": "Patricia A. Millett", "text": " --They -- they may or may not.   As we pointed out in the Kinsey case, the Texas Court of -- the Texas courts have actually entertained a speedy trial claim in -- at both levels.   It was raised on direct review and then it wasn't -- but -- right.   It was also -- they have raised in both forums.   So it casts some doubt on the procedural default argument advanced here, but you're right.   Of course there -- there are issues here, but the question is whether Congress wanted a gap.   In Johnson v. United States, this Court construed 2255, I think it was subsection 4 there, the one on -- if a conviction is overturned it was used to enhance.   And then what is the timing to come back and file a habeas claim to change your sentence that relied on a now-vacated prior conviction.   And this Court said we are not going to construe this language to create a gap between when the -- when the finality attaches and when the time that you can actually file for post-conviction review commences.   The whole point of this, of 2244, was to respect State processes.   It's not another exhaustion requirement; it's respect the State.   And Texas couldn't be clear; in ex parte Johnson footnote 2, it says the appeal continues -- sorry, may I finish the sentence?   The appeal continues until the mandate issues.   Federal law shouldn't change that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I just have a -- I don't understand the 99 percent figure.
