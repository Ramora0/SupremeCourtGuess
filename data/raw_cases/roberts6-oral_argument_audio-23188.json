[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato.   Mr. Miller. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The Social Security Administration has reasonably interpreted the Social Security Act to provide that as a general rule, a person seeking to establish eligibility or child survivor benefits must show that he or she would have been able to inherit personal property from the decedent under applicable State intestacy law.   That interpretation is supported by the text, structure and history of the act, and it comports with principles of federalism because it defers to State law on the determination of family status, which is a traditional subject of State regulation.   It's reasonable and entitled to deference under Chevron.   Now, the textual arguments in this case involve the interaction of three provisions of the act.   The first is section 402(d)(1), which is the basic benefits-granting provision.   And that says that under certain conditions, the child of a wage earner is entitled to benefits.   And that provision has a cross-reference to a definition of 416(e) of the act.   And 416(e), which is reprinted at page 4A of the appendix to our brief, says that the term \"child\" means: One, the child or legally adopted child of an individual; two, a stepchild under certain cases; and three, a person who is the grandchild or step-grandchild of an individual.   Now, I think the one thing that's immediately apparent from looking at that provision is that under anyone's reading it's a little bit confusing because it uses the word \"child\" twice to mean two different things.   That is, the first \"child\" is broader than the second, because the first one includes the second as well as adopted child, stepchild, and so forth. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Suppose a State legislature got the crazy idea that children born to married people during the time of the marriage shouldn't inherit under State intestacy law.   Would that mean that they would be ineligible for survivors' benefits? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " But what if they did -- what if they did that? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " --There -- there are two alternative mechanisms that Congress added to the statute in the 1960s to allow children who lack intestacy rights to establish their eligibility.   Those are 416(h)(2)(B) and 416(h)(3).   And 416(h)(3) says that an applicant who is the son or a daughter of an insured individual but is not a child under paragraph A, which is the reference to State intestacy law, shall nevertheless be deemed to be a child if there was an acknowledgment in writing that the child was -- that the applicant was the son or daughter, or there was a court decree for support.   But I think-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Those are -- those are obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose parents are not married. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " --That -- that's right.   And -- and the reason for that is that in fact, under the law of every State, both in 1939 and today, children whose parents are married do have State -- do have intestacy rights.   But I -- I think what -- what the provision I just referred to illustrates is that the term \"child\" in this statute is a legal term of art, because if you were just looking at the ordinary meaning of the word \"child\", the concept of an applicant who is a son or daughter but is not a child, would be completely nonsensical. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Maybe it means something else.   Maybe it means that to the Congress that initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a child was a child.   They knew what a child was.   And the type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child.   There wasn't a need for any definition of that.   And they -- they never had any inkling about the situation that has arisen in this case, just as they had no inkling that any State would go off and take away intestacy rights for children born to married people during the course of their marriage. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Well, I mean -- I think -- I think those -- those are probably accurate factual claims about what Congress was thinking.   But had -- had Congress wanted -- the way that Congress chose to make sure that the children of married parents could establish their eligibility was by looking to State intestacy law, because Congress knew that under State intestacy law, those children had such rights. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But isn't there something sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about stepchildren and grandchildren and even step-grandchildren in which State intestacy law is not referenced, but you are that saying that as to the largest category, the category in which 90 percent of people are going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to State law. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Well, it -- that -- that is what section 416(h) says.   Section 416(h) sets out a rule-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, suppose I'm not so convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is because there are two sentences of -- of section (h).   I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress would have specified everything about what -- how you get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at issue. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " --Well, I think -- I think it's because with respect to the main category of people at issue the question Congress was asking is, what is the class of people who are likely to have a sufficiently close relationship to the insured person such that it would be appropriate to provide benefits to replace the loss of support that they would likely be getting during the person's life.   And if you look at what is the body of law that defines that class of people who have a close relationship with someone, it's State intestacy law.   And State intestacy law sets out sort of a clear, easy to apply rules for the distribution of estates. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, they don't always do-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " There's one provision in (h) that is puzzling and maybe you can tell me what it means.   It's at (h)(2)(A), and it's the last sentence of (A).   It says:   \"Applicants who according to State law would have the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child shall be deemed such. \"   What person is that referring to?   Someone who is not a child but has the same status as a child? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " That -- that's right.   The first sentence sets up a general rule that you look to State law for the definition of \"child\".   And the second sentence says that people who do not have the status of children but nevertheless have the inheritance rights of children shall be deemed children.   And as a practical matter the people that that applies to are people who have been equitably adopted.   There is a doctrine in the law of many states where you have an adoption or you have an agreement to adopt, but not yet a completed legal adoption.   In that circumstance the would-be adoptee does not have the status of a child for all purposes or even necessarily for all inheritance law purposes, but can take property from the adopting parents.   So that's who would be covered by that sentence and that is now addressed in the regulations, I believe, at-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Anyone else or just that category?

I mean, let's take a situation where this type of -- of reproduction is -- is new, and the State legislatures haven't had a chance to decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for State intestacy law or not.   What would SSA do? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " --Well, the SSA does the best that it can to figure out what the State law is, and then on review in the district court, you know, the district court is able to review that.   And there have been cases in which district courts have certified questions to State courts.   And I think actually the fact that there are those difficult questions that can come up in some of the cases, particularly involving assisted reproductive technology, really illustrates one of the virtues of leaving it to the States rather than, as Respondent would have it, effectively forcing SSA and then the Federal courts on review of its decisions to create a sort of Federal common law of parentage to resolve all of those very difficult questions. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There was in my memory, and it's been a while, that some States, if not all -- and that's what I was going to ask you, basically deem any child born during the marriage to be a child of the marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so that if a mother has had a relationship outside of marriage the married parent is still responsible for that child.   That would take care of, I think, a great number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the biological input of one of the parents? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " That -- that's right.   And in fact there are statutes in a number of States addressing a question of when a -- yes.   Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yes.   My question was, do all States have similar rulings?   And for those that don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new technology?   What happens to that child in terms of their definition of whether they will be considered a child for Social Security purposes? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " I -- I can't speak with certainty to all the States, but I believe that that is the -- the general rule.   So I'm not aware of any -- any States where when you have a married couple using donor -- donor sperm, that the child would not be deemed the child of the husband. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " My impression is that, I'm not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision, a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the father. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " I believe that is -- that is the general rule.   And I think one thing that that illustrates, of course, is that Respondent's definition, which is also the court of appeals' definition of what a child is, and the definition that they urge the Court to apply in 416, is the biological child of married parents.   And not only is the -- does the 1939 and today there are many cases in which biological parentage is not determinative of legal parentage, both for the reason that we were just talking about and then also for -- another example is when you have an adoption; a child who has been adopted by somebody else is no longer legally the child of his biological parents.

Miller", "text": " That -- that's right.   I mean I -- what I will say is, just speaking in general terms about dependency, the statute creates a number of presumptions that allow basically any -- any natural child, any child under the -- that first -- that second child in 416(e)(1), anyone who fits into that category is deemed to be dependent.

Would he meet any of the requirements of (c), of (d)(1)(C). "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " --The dependency requirement is defined in 402(d)(3) and -- which unfortunately is not reproduced in the appendix, but which had the effect of making anyone who qualifies under 416(h) be deemed dependent.   Now, we don't think that the children in this case qualify under 416(h), so there is not even any need to reach the dependency question here. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Then what does (d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by-- "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Well, the dependency requirement is something that people who don't qualify under 416(h), people who are adopted, children or stepchildren or grandchildren may in some cases have to make an individualized determination of actual dependence.

And I -- I would refer you on that point to the agency's regulations defining dependency, which are 404.361, which say that any natural child, which is the term the agency uses for that second child in 416(e), any natural child is deemed dependent. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " May I ask?   Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous.   Is that your position?   Is it your position that the definition of \"child\" is ambiguous and that we have to give the agency deference, or is it your position that in the context it's unambiguous and even if the Social Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it couldn't, in the circumstances of this case? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " I think that when the statute was initially enacted in 1939 with more or less the same structure of these provisions as we have now, it might at that time have been ambiguous.   But the agency adopted an interpretation that is, again, in structure materially identical to its current interpretation in 1940 and it has adhered to it ever since.   And Congress has amended the statute with the understanding that that was the interpretation, that everybody had to go through State law to qualify.   And I think in light of that history, at this point, and Congress's ratification of that understanding, at this point the best view is that it is unambiguous, and clearly resolves the question in favor of the interpretation set out in the agency's regulations. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Miller, could I take you back to 416(e).   I take it that you don't contest that for purposes of deciding that this -- which stepchildren get benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we are just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State law on those questions; is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Yes, because those terms do not appear in 416(h).   There is no instruction in the statute that those terms be defined by reference to State law, as there is with respect to \"child\". "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You know, I'm looking at some of these, the grandchildren one for example.   It says the person who is the grandchild, but only if, blah, blah, blah.   It seems to have just sort of an understanding of what a grandchild is.   In other words, it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's limiting a class of grandchildren with a preexisting understanding of what a grandchild is.   And so I'm wondering, if that's true of grandchildren, why isn't it also true of children? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Well, I should say two things about that, then.   The first is specifically with respect to grandchildren.   The agency -- the agency has defined a 404.358. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I'm sorry, the child of a child.   The child -- what kind of child? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Somebody who would qualify under 416(h) as a child. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Oh, so for grandchildren the agency is also looking to State law? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Indirectly.   I mean, \"grandchild\" is not expressly defined in the act, but somebody who qualifies either under State law or you could also qualify as a stepchild or adopted child of someone who qualifies as a child in that same sense.   But again, the lack of a -- a -- what is significant, I think, is the lack of any other provision in the statute that tells you how to define \"grandchild\".   I mean, the run of cases that Congress was concerned about involved children, and for -- in explaining to the agency how to deal with those cases, Congress gave explicit guidance and that's to look to State law in 416(h).   Now, Respondent makes much of the fact that the benefits-granting provision, 402(d), has an express cross-reference to the definition in 416(e), but doesn't cross-reference the definition in 416(h).   And I think there are two problems with that argument, the first of which is that 416(h) by its own terms says that it applies for purposes of this subchapter, that is throughout all of the parts of the act that we are talking about here.   So effectively 416(h) incorporates itself into the 416(e) definition and there is no need for an express cross-reference.   The second point about that is that the structure of the definitions here is very similar to the structure of the definitions used in defining other family relationships that are eligible for benefits.   So under 402, some of the other subsections of 402, there are benefits for the wife or husband or widow or widower of an insured person.   And just to take the benefits for a wife as an example, in 402(b) the statute says that the   \"wife -- as defined in section 416(d) of this title. \"   under certain circumstances can get benefits.   If you look at the definition in 416(b) of 416(e).   It says:   \"The term \"wife\" means the wife of an individual. \"   and then it has some limitations. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Can you -- go ahead, finish. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " If you were to take Respondent's approach, you would just stop there and apply some Federal standard of figuring out whether people are married or not.   But in fact 416(h), paragraph 1 of 416(h), says an applicant is the wife or husband or widow or widower of an insured person if the State courts would regard them as being married.   So -- and in the 1939 act, all of those references to State law for wives and widows and children were all combined in one paragraph, so it was even clearer that that was how the statute worked, that you look to State law for defining all these family relationships. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Counsel, I now have in front of me (h)(3).   I don't see how it has anything to do with whether the child was dependent under (d)(1)(C).   Why do you think it has something to do with that? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " I'm sorry.   The definition of dependency is in (d)(3), 402(d)(3), not -- 402(d)(3) says a child shall be deemed dependent upon his father unless at such time such individual was not living with or contributing to the support of such child and the child is neither the legitimate nor adopted child of the individual.   So the effect of that is anyone who is a legitimate child is deemed dependent under 402(d)(3). "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, unless such individual was not living with or contributing to the support of such child, which is certainly the case here -- the child had not yet been born -- and other qualifications.   The principal condition does not exist.   \"Shall be deemed dependent upon his father or adopting father unless at such time such individual, mother or father or adopted father, was not living with or contributing to the support of such child. \"   How does that alter the dependency requirement of (d)(1)(C)? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " Because the child is deemed dependent unless he was -- again, since -- to be clear, we think that the children in this case do not -- are not eligible for child status because they don't meet the requirements of 416(h). "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, that may well be.   If that is ambiguous, why doesn't -- why doesn't (d)(1)(C), despite -- what is it (h)(3) or whatever the 3 we've been playing with here, despite (d)(3), despite that it seems to me that they don't meet that requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Eric D. Miller", "text": " That -- that might well be the case.   Our position is simply that that is not an issue that the agency has addressed and that would be a matter for the agency to resolve in the first instance if this Court were to disagree with us on the definition of \"child\".   I referred a minute ago to the 1939 act and the structure of that act, and I think that's very instructive because again the way that the provisions were arranged in the 1939 act, as we set out in our brief, were the same for present purposes as they are today, and Congress when it amended the act in the 1960s to allow certain nonmarital children to be eligible for child status recognized that that was the case, recognized the commission's interpretation that that everybody had to go through 416(h) and establish their eligibility under State law, and then chose to make express exceptions to the requirement of State law for those children.   No such exception applies here.   If I could reserve the remainder of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Miller.   Mr. Rothfeld. "}, {"speaker": "Charles A. Rothfeld", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I can, I will start with a question that Justice Sotomayor asked about ambiguity or not of the statute, and we think that in fact the statute is not ambiguous at all.   We think that it unambiguously dictates the reading that we advance.   And it's useful, I think, in addressing the case to recognize that it presents essentially two issues.   One is whether all of the categories of applicants for child survivor benefits that are defined to be children in the statutory definition of 416, qualify for child benefits without reference to State law, as we submit.   If they do, then the second question is whether the children in this case, the Capato twins, fall within one of the categories of children so defined, and we think that they very clearly do.   Congress said expressly that every child as defined by 416(e) shall receive benefits so long as they satisfy certain criteria that are not at issue in this case.   Section 416(e), to which Congress has expressly directed us in determining who is a child eligible for these benefits, defines a child to be:   \"(1) a child or adopted child; (2) a stepchild-- \" "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Excuse me.

One is the point that was raised by Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, that at the time Congress enacted the statute in 1939 the overwhelming majority of children in the United States, more than 90 percent -- it was actually more than 95 percent -- were the children of married parents.   And so when Congress-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --But that would be true under State intestate law. "}, {"speaker": "Charles A. Rothfeld", "text": " --Well, it's simply as to what Congress had in mind when it said a child is a child.   You asked where marriage comes from in the statute.   I think when Congress said a child is a child, as I think Justice Alito's question suggested, it would have had in mind the paradigm of a child at that time, which was the children-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But the words -- you say this is plain meaning.   It says the child of a wage earner, an individual.   It seems to me you are importing the term \"married\", because someone can be the undisputed child of a wage earner who is unmarried.

Rothfeld", "text": " --Let me say two things about that, and first, to continue the question of where marriage comes from, there is a textual reference to marriage which appears in section 416(h)(2)(b), the companion to the intestacy provision upon which the government relies.

B, we think the reason -- what Congress was very concerned with accomplishing in the statute was that -- guaranteeing certainty in the parentage -- in parentage and the parental relationship.   And it set up a system of -- because in 1939 there were no genetic paternity test.   There was no -- it was impossible to be absolutely, scientifically certain as to who the -- at least as to father was.   Congress set up a series of proxies to establish whether or not the applicant for child benefits was in fact the child.   The principal one of those was the marital relationship because in 1939, as I think Justice Scalia's question suggested, there was a very strong virtually per se conclusive presumption that a child born in marriage was the biological natural child of both of the father and mother of the married couple.   And so the existence of the marriage was a way of establishing in 1939 dispositively that the child was the child of the parents, the child of the survivor -- of the insured whose eligibility for benefits are being invoked here.

Our sense of what Congress was up to was that it wanted to assure certainty, as I just said in response to the previous question in establishing parentage.   And the principal way in 1939 that Congress could do that was by A, invoking existence of a parental relationship which established sort of as a pro se matter that the children born within the marriage were the children of each of the married -- each member of the married couple.   For parents -- children who do not fall into that category there was this additive provision of section (h) which provided a mechanism for doing it and establishing that State intestacy law would recognize this child as the child of, typically it was going to be the attorney that was contested -- the child of the father -- each established a mechanism for doing that.

And so to give effect to those meanings -- to give effect to those provisions, to give them meaning, 416(h) has to have broader application than just in cases of disputed biological parentage.   It is in fact the gateway through which everyone has to pass, and that's how the -- the agency has -- has so regarded it.   The final point I would make is simply that even if the statute were silent on whether to look to State law, it would be appropriate for the Court to hesitate, I think, before creating what in effect is a body of Federal common law about parental status.   Here, of course, there is an the express textual command the other way, and it would be particularly inappropriate to create as Respondents are urging, a Federal rule that goes well beyond what any State would allow in the context-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And the first sentence sets up a general rule that you are looking to State law, and then the second is about people who would have the same status as children under State law, so that the basic background definition in -- in either case is coming from State law.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " So if the person is a child, you have applicants who according to State law had the same status as a child, a person has that status because the person is a child, and the person is deemed to be a child -- it seems very clear that that shows that (h), that this provision is directed to people that Congress in 1939 did not think fell within this paradigm of a child.
