[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 20-440, Minerva Surgical, Incorporated versus Hologic, Incorporated. Mr. Hochman. "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Patent Act doesn't provide for assignor estoppel and never has.   In fact, it says invalidity shall be a defense in any action.   That's essential to the fundamental patent market.   The public grants exclusive rights but only to the extent inventors publicly share useful advances in knowledge.   Accused infringers who prove a patent is invalid vindicate the right of all to make and use and sell unpatented project -- products. Hologic says Congress didn't have to write assignor estoppel into the Patent Act.   It reads this Court's 1924 decision in Formica as having settled assignor estoppel into patent law.   We don't think that's what Formica did, but it doesn't matter because the world didn't stop in 1924. In 1945, this Court allowed an assignor to invalidate a patent in Scott Paper. That's squarely contrary to assignor estoppel. In 1947, in Katzinger, this Court confirmed that Scott Paper meant an assignor was free to challenge the validity of a patent.   And Lear, looking back on the state of the law before 1952, said that this Court had by then undermined the very basis of any general rule of patent estoppel. The logic of this Court's decisions require abandoning assignor estoppel. Exposing bad patents is vital patent law policy, and allowing assignors to do so carries no meaningful costs.   No reliance interests stand in the way of eliminating this anomalous doctrine.   And a patent-law-specific limitation on the rights of assignors is nothing like claim preclusion or issue preclusion or even equitable estoppel, which are generally applicable rules woven into our basic notions of fair and efficient litigation. At the very least, an inventor should be allowed to show that the assignee is asserting a claim broader than what the inventor adequately described and enabled.   Not even estoppel by deed, assignor estoppel's supposed model, supports preventing challenges that appear on the face of the patent. And when, as here, the assignee, not the assignor, prosecuted the relevant claim nine years after the patent rights were sold and did so to prevent competition from the assignor's new improved device, assignor estoppel is particularly at odds with patent law policy. This Court should order the Federal Circuit to consider Minerva's Section 112 invalidity argument on the merits. Be happy to take any questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Hochman. I want to focus a little bit on your -- your policy argument that getting rid of assignor estoppel would help, you know, get rid -- rid of bad patents in encouraging inventors to -- to challenge particular claims. But I thought strong patents was the way we encourage invention and that assignor estoppel helped ensure the strength and stability of -- of those patents.   How do you sort out those competing policy arguments? "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Well, I think the main policy point is that our -- our -- our patent system absolutely believes in encouraging innovation, but it's -- as I referred in my opening to the patent bargain, it's for -- there's -- there's a -- there's a bargain on the other side.   The inventors have to provide, among other things, a description and -- and enablement of what they've done.   They have to give that to the public in order to get the benefit. And our patent system depends on challenges to validity to make sure that we don't over-protect, we don't provide the benefits of patent exclusivity without the parties doing all the things, without the inventors doing all the things, necessary to earn that substantial public benefit. That includes the time-limited nature of the -- of the exclusivity in Scott Paper, and it includes, among other things, the written description and enable -- enablement issues involved here. So it -- it's true that assignor estoppel leads to challenging bad patents, but that strengthens the overall policy of the patent system and corrects -- and helps correct for the over-patenting that is built into the system and has been discussed by scholars for a long time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, if -- if we do not agree with you that we should get rid of assignor estoppel altogether, do you have any complaints about the position of the United States on how to limit it? "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Yeah.   I think -- I think we would certainly prevail on the position of the United States.   I think the most important thing to say about the position of the United States is that we -- we do not agree that this Court should simply send it back to the Federal Circuit to figure out whether assignor estoppel should apply in this case. This Court should do that in this case for a number of reasons.   First, it's exceedingly important that the assignor estoppel issue, which is a threshold question -- it's going to open up or close a -- a -- a -- a complicated question about validity that involves experts and litigation and all sorts of other costly litigation processes.   It's important that that issue be decided clearly and -- and decisively early on in the case.   And it -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, you said that the -- you could not compare assignor estoppel to issue -- concepts such as issue preclusion or claim preclusion, et cetera.   You -- you distinguished them, but I don't think you demonstrated why those principles, which do not appear in the Patent Act, are applicable or acceptable, but assignor estoppel is not. "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Yeah.   So, Justice -- thank you, Justice Thomas.   Our argument with respect to that is there are -- we don't dispute that there are times when common law principles inform the background assumptions against which Congress legislates.   It's just not everything in the common law, and it's not every -- and it's not every common law principle. And issue preclusion and claim preclusion, I think, are maybe unique both in the length of which -- that they've been part of the common law and the uniformity with which they have been adopted not just in patent cases, and -- and not need to be adapted to patent cases, but are applicable generally across the board. I would think issue preclusion and claim preclusion is a background assumption of every statute, every cause of action Congress writes, unless it says otherwise. This Court, you know, for -- for hundreds -- for more than 150 years has said those doctrines are implicit in the notion of a fair and efficient judicial system. Assignor estoppel is nothing like that. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, let's -- Petitioner here -- I'm really interested in clarification more than anything else on this point.   But Petitioner here assigned a certain patent.   There were changes to that, and I didn't quite get how much the patent was changed or continued.   If you could help me on that, I'd appreciate it. "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Yeah, and -- and for this, it -- it -- it -- it would help if you could turn to the Joint Appendix at page 833, the supplemental appendix.   That's the patent. And then maybe put a finger in the same supplemental appendix, 903, which is Claim 31. I mean, here -- here's the difference. Okay? Their -- their position is that their patent, claim -- which is Claim 1, it's Column 19 at page 833, and I'm going to focus on the second paragraph there, an applicator -- which -- which has the term \"applicator head.\" The -- the dispute is whether an applicator head, the -- the -- the part that comes into contact with the endometrial lining, can be moisture-permeable, has to be moisture-permeable, or can be moisture-impermeable.   They are --- their -- their invention, their -- their patent says -- has been construed to allow a moisture-impermeable applicator head. Now they don't -- they -- they have exactly one thing they point to that suggests -- that they say suggests that the -- the inventor, Csaba Truckai, when he originally filed his application, had the same thing, and they point to this page, 903. And you'll notice one -- one most -- the most conspicuous and obvious thing about this is that the term \"applicator head\" isn't even in that claim.   It's not even there. And I hasten to add that if you go back to 833 and you go down about line 13, it says that \"when the applicator head is in its expanded state, it's configured to form to the shape of the uterus.\" So it's coming into contact.   It's -- it's -- it's -- that claim -- that claim limitation is also not in Claim 31. So what they have is a claim where a -- a moisture-impermeable device traps moisture by conforming to the shape of the uterus and traps moisture there.   And they're saying that Truckai did that as well.   And there's simply nothing -- nothing at all in Claim 31 that even remotely suggests that moisture should be trapped. That, by the way -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank -- "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " -- is another -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Now you want to abolish it entirely, but we have many briefs that suggest not entirely but limited. Which set of limitations, in your opinion, would be the best? And, in particular, as the Chief asked, what's wrong with the limitations set forth by the government? "}, {"speaker": "Robert N.

My -- my fundamental quibble -- and it's really -- it's really in this case a quibble with the government's position -- really turns on how -- how to implement this materially identical.   I think that's a pernicious introduction of ambiguity in the application of the doctrine. But here's how I understand the government's position, and this may help.   The government seems to be focused on ensuring that if an inventor has made a genuine representation that his invention encompasses, you know, as much as the assignee ultimately obtains, that the inventor should be held to that. And my concern is that if -- if -- if you -- if you go back to the estoppel-by-deed roots of this, the kind of genuineness, the kind of representation has to be rock solid.   It has to be truly firm. A warranty deed accompanied by a seal is a special kind of assertion about a true fact in the state of the world in all of the law. And to allow debates over the scope of never-issued patent claims like claim -- like Application Claim 31 at Joint Appendix 903 is to -- is to introduce a completely different sort of ambiguity into the process than -- than -- than has any kind of basis for an estoppel. So I would say it should be, you know, very, very close to text -- would require very, very close to textual identity, and, importantly, I would also add -- and the government's a little ambiguous about this -- it has to have been pending both at the time the party against whom the estoppel is asserted assigned away the rights and the party who is asserting the estoppel obtained the rights. In other words, it has to have been a representation that was made and actually somebody looking at the patent file at the time thinks was still being made at the time of the assignment.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, my fundamental question is, why is this a question for us and not a question for Congress? It's a question of statutory interpretation ultimately.   There's precedent supporting the doctrine in some form. The Federal Circuit, which is the court that Congress created to deal with these issues, has worked out a body of precedent on it. There are policy arguments in both directions.   There are potentially influential supporters of both sides of this argument.   Why should we get into this? Would we not have to overrule some of our precedents to do what you ask? "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " No, Justice Alito, I don't think you would.   The only precedent that has been -- that is even purporting to require being overruled is Formica.   And, remember, Formica allowed a party, an assignor, to use prior art to narrow the scope of the claims. The government agrees that today that's an invalidity argument.   This is exactly the kind of doctrinal dinosaur, as -- as this Court said in Kimble, that you -- you abandon, that you give up on.   Lear and Scott Paper have already done all of the work.   It's not -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You think Kim -- you think Kimble's approach to statute -- to stare decisis supports you here? "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " I actually think -- I actually think it does, Your Honor, because I -- I don't think you have a square holding in Formica in favor, as we've argued in our brief, and -- and we can -- we can get into this if you want.   We read Formica exactly the way the United States read Formica in the Katzinger case, as providing only implied approval. This isn't -- this isn't the kind of precedent that you have to -- you know, you have to treat as settled and -- because it doesn't appear to have been settled.   And I would emphasize also Scott Paper, you know, as this Court said in Katzinger, expressly allowed -- already did the work, expressly allowed an assignor to challenge invalidity. It is exceedingly difficult to come up with a principle, Lear said it's impossible to come up with a principle, that can constrain the rationale for allowing an assignor in -- the assignor in Scott Paper to challenge validity for the reasons asserted there and any other invalidity challenges. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   One -- one other -- one other question if I can get it in. Can parties contract around this? Can an assignment specify whether the assignor can challenge the patent or not, or would that be against public policy in some sense? "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Yeah, I think -- you know, this Court hasn't squarely answered that question.   I think, in fairness, this Court -- most of what this Court has had to say on the subject of that question points away from allowing parties to do that for the same reason that this Court has repeated -- has -- has so deeply undermined assignor estoppel. This Court has said over and over for more than 150 years going back -- you know, for -- for roughly 150 years going way, way back saying that it is critical that everyone be available to challenge the validity of patents. Assignors in particular are super well positioned to do that and do the public service of invalidating bad patents and freeing up competition. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And it would be an astonishing inversion of the judicial hierarchy for this Court to infer congressional acquiescence to the Federal Circuit's view on patent law even while this Court's decisions in Scott Paper and Lear had, for 30 years, left the doctrine dead. I think that's -- I don't think there's any basis for any kind of post-enactment -- any kind of -- that would be a -- an uncommon and never-before-seen standard of post-enactment inference.   And I also think, with respect, that the Federal Circuit -- it -- it persisted for so long only because the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over patent law. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Practicing the prior art defense is -- is actually an invalidity argument. Narrowing the claim in light of the prior art is, you know, a kind of absolute method of last resort and you -- in fact, is preferred as an invalidity argument.   So the law has moved in -- in that respect in a significant way. Lear specifically said that looking -- that -- that it was not the general rule, so -- but, by the time, you know, that the -- the -- the case of -- you know, it's considering licensee estoppel, the idea that patent estoppel was a general rule had been -- has already been declared by this Court no longer a general rule. So I think, under these circumstances -- oh, I would also add -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   Let me -- let me take you to a different place.   Let's think about the core application of assignor estoppel, and I guess I want to know why it is that you don't think that this core application makes a lot of sense and accords with our basic principles of fairness. So let's say that an inventor invents something.   She obtains a patent.   She later sells the patent.   And she then argues that the invention was completely obvious all the time and isn't patentable. So the question is, why is it fair to entertain that invalidity argument? It seems as though it's a total bait-and-switch. "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Right.   If it's a bait-and-switch, then you have a very -- a traditional equitable estoppel argument.   But assignor estoppel is different from equitable estoppel, right?

And the -- but the SG says we -- we can -- we can save the day, we can fix it. And it's going to be more than equitable estoppel, but it isn't going to be that much more.   A arm's-length valuable consideration of materially identical claims. I want to know what I'm buying there. What -- what -- what -- I know how to apply equitable estoppel.

Materially identical, again, I mean, if it's given a really robust application by this Court and it's made clear that it is, you know, something in the nature of approaching textually identical, well, then you have, I think, a fairly strong basis for being assured of consistent application. But the -- the risk of inconsistent application, the risk that an inventor never intended something but is later, with the benefit of hindsight and -- and -- you know, and able -- able lawyering, as -- as -- you know, attorneys for Hologic are obviously able lawyers, going back and -- and -- and -- and filling in inferences and assertions about what was written down in an application in 1998 means -- should be understood to mean today in light of everything we know today, I think, is pernicious, and I don't think we should be getting into that.

Most of these cases involve small inventors assigning patents to very large corporations and who are fully capable of examining the patent and may be in better position to identify its validity and who undoubtedly very rarely rely on these individuals.

Your lead argument in the brief from pages 17 to 41 is to eliminate the doctrine of assignor estoppel, and I guess I want to pick up on Justice Kagan's questions on that. You have Chief Justice Taft, of course, in Westinghouse referring to the doctrine at that point in 1924 as well-settled since 1880, and it's continued without elimination since then. So what -- what is -- I'm not sure I heard exactly what is the special justification and particularly in a statutory case, where, as Justice Alito said, our -- our doctrine of stare decisis is especially strong.   So why -- why get involved in overturning something that was well settled as of 1924? "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Because -- because it -- it didn't stay well settled because this Court in Scott Paper very clearly allowed an invalidity claim capping their -- agreed with that characterization of it.   The -- so the result is you actually -- the -- the -- the rule -- the rule of assignor estoppel is assignor cannot challenge the validity of the patent. Scott Paper says the assignor can challenge the validity of the patent. So now we have something that's no longer actually a rule.   And Lear already -- already recognized this.   So, in other words, this is a kind of, as -- as Kimble says, doctrinal dinosaur.   It has been whittled away. It has been -- the arguments for it have not only been undermined as a matter of policy, assignors are -- are -- are available to do a very -- a very important public service of exposing bad patents. The argument that it was just a -- that Formica sort of gave -- gave full consideration, I think that doesn't hold up to inspection.   It didn't discuss the relevant statutory language.

It went through a lot of the lower court cases and, you know, starts with 1880, and -- I guess I'm not sure about that, but let me ask you a different question. In the Respondents' brief, they say that assignor estoppel has engendered serious reliance interests, which is something we also have to think about, and they say -- I just want to get your reaction to -- for decades, millions of patents and applications have been assigned on the assumption that assignor estoppel bars assignors from later challenging the validity of the assigned patent rights. Just want to get your reaction to that. "}, {"speaker": "Robert N.

Commentators had said it was dead. And for 30 years, between Lear and Diamond Scientific, there was no issue about patent assignments.   There was nobody running around claiming that their reliance interests had been undermined. And, true, you know, the Federal Circuit's rule has been in place since Diamond Scientific.   But let's -- you know, there's been no discussion of the magnitude.   You know, the -- the -- the notion that parties pay a premium so that -- because assignors aren't going to be able to challenge the validity of the patent is pure speculation -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

"}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Hochman, I want to ask you about equitable estoppel. So how might equitable estoppel play out in this particular case? Let's say there's no assignor estoppel.   You know, you have them alleging that Mr. Truckai had lied in his inventor's oath and then admitted that after the fact.   And then you have this dispute about Claim 31 of his original application being nearly identical to Claim 1 of the later patent. So is there any way -- is it just about a lack of reliance interest? Or, if you assume that those allegations that your friends on the other side make are true, would there be any case for equitable estoppel here? "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Yeah, I think the case for equitable estoppel would be dead.   I mean, there would be no -- there would be no equitable estoppel argument here at all, respectfully. So, first off, there's no reason to believe at the time in two -- in 2004 that anybody at Cytyc thought or believed they were buying a patent that could cover a moisture-impermeable device.   The only thing they've -- but they've never said Mr. Truckai said anything to that effect to them, and the only thing they pointed to, again, is this Application Claim 31. And, respectfully, it just doesn't do that.   It doesn't -- it not only doesn't have the language in the -- in their claim.   They didn't pick up Application Claim 31 and prosecute it.   They wrote a different claim. And they did it because it doesn't have the claim term \"applicator head.\" The closest thing it has is the term \"electrode array.\" And the term \"electrode array,\" their view is, oh, because the term, it says \"electrode array,\" but it doesn't say \"moisture-impermeable\" expressly, that means it must be -- it must cover moisture-permeable. But I don't even know what a moisture-permeable electrode array would be. That -- the electrode array is just the positioning, how the electrodes are positioned on some other part of the product, whether it's the applicator -- called the applicator head or sometimes called the electrode carrying means.

"}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So, you know, I think that the assignor estoppel doctrine, you know, as estoppel doctrines often do when they're thinking about fairness, you know, punishes a turncoat assignor, right, and there's something unseemly about representing to the person to whom you're assigning a patent, it doesn't cover this, you know, it's -- it's valid, and then turning around and -- and we all see the problem. You suggest that there can really be no reliance because people, especially sophisticated parties, as Justice Gorsuch suggests, are -- are doing their own investigation of the patent's validity. Is there any reason why the reliance incurred or why there would be reliance by the parties who are the assignees that could hurt them? I mean, you suggest that they're perfectly capable of analyzing the patents and they're not going to be, you know, led down the primrose path by the assignor. "}, {"speaker": "Robert N. Hochman", "text": " Yeah, I mean, I think -- well, with respect to this issue in particular, Section 112, all you have to do is pick up the -- the patent specification and look at it, and you can find that there's just no explanation at all that could support a moisture-impermeable device.   So I don't -- if they -- if -- if -- I don't know what they could have relied on under these circumstances. But I -- I -- I -- I also think it's important to note, and one of the things that hasn't come out, is that when you have a patent application, there's all this turncoat concern. Before a claim issues, the patent prosecution process -- and both parties agree about this -- necessarily involves a lot of give and take with the patent examiner.   Sometimes you go back and you do your own further research or further work on the product, and you discover new things about the product, and that requires changing the claims.   Sometimes it requires removing claims.   Sometimes it requires expanding them.   Sometimes it requires narrowing them.   And it's that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Look, as this discussion makes clear, assignor estoppel is a doctrinal dinosaur.   We should abandon it.   But, at a minimum, no plausible justification supports applying assignor estoppel here. Hologic chose to draft and prosecute its own broad claim that finds no support in Truckai's then 15-year-old specification, and it did so precisely because it wanted to frustrate competition from Truckai's latest innovation. Having gone beyond the specification, it has also gone beyond the range of any even arguable estoppel.   As a matter of equitable estoppel or any other kind of estoppel, this Court should not allow assignor estoppel to be wielded as a sword to frustrate legitimate competition. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Ratner", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As Petitioner has explained, the Federal Circuit's test for assignor estoppel is too broad.   That court prevents an assignor from challenging any claim relating to an assigned invention, even if that claim looks nothing like the claims that existed at the time of the assignment.   That's not how estoppel ordinarily works. The foundational requirement for estoppel is inconsistency, and an assignor acts inconsistently only when the claims it challenges at time two are the same as the claims it sold at time one. But, while we agree with Petitioner that the Federal Circuit got it wrong, we don't agree that this Court should get rid of assignor estoppel altogether.   Lower courts have applied the doctrine for 140 years.   This Court approved it in 1924, and Congress hasn't seen fit to eliminate it over all that time. Assignor estoppel can still play an important role but only if it's limited to a true estoppel doctrine reflecting its origins in estoppel by deed. I welcome the Court's questions.

So the court of appeals has to figure out which of those two assignments and then what claims were pending at the time.   And at the time of the '98 assignment but not the 2004 assignment, there was this Claim 31.   And then the question would be, we think, is Claim 31 essentially the same as Claim 1?

But I have a -- a second question, which I'll say what it is, is what I'm having trouble doing. I can understand abolishing it.   I can understand keeping it.   But limiting it, I'm finding trouble in finding the right way to do that.   Why? Well, Smith invents a widget.   He goes to another company, having assigned the widget to the first company, and the second company wants to go ahead and sell widget prime. The first company sues, and what they want to argue, perhaps like here, is, wait a minute, what we want to make has nothing to do with that patent.   Oh, no, it does, go look at the claims.   Well, it can't because, if it did include widget prime, the patent would be unlawful.   So you see it can't.   Well, says the Fed Circuit, you can't argue that; you're attacking your own patent. So I -- I think, my God, they're foisting this invention on the public forever and they can't argue even something like that and they can't even make widget prime? Do you see the problem?

Ratner", "text": " So I think we're solving it in two ways.   There are two basic questions that we think need to be addressed before assignor estoppel is applied. The first is, is this a real transaction? That's the -- the discussion I was having with the Chief.   Is this the type of transaction that someone might be said to be making implicit warranties? Is this sort of an arm's-length sale between party A and party B? And -- and that could knock out any circumstances like an employee who agrees up front to give anything invented. And then the second is, is there a match between what someone said was valuable at the time of the sale and what's at issue now? And we think if after patent rights are assigned that the assignee goes out and gets extremely broad new patents, then the price for that is they have to defend the breadth of that claim against the world, including the person who assigned those claims.

We do think it is -- is good policy, but we also think that it derives both from this Court's decision in Westinghouse and, before that, from basic principles of estoppel by deed.   And there has been a lot of discussion about equitable estoppel here, but I think it's important to remember that at common law, estoppel consisted of estoppel by deed, estoppel by conduct, or estoppel by record.   Estoppel by conduct is what we now think of as equitable estoppel. And -- and these are the basic principles, we think, that control the estoppel by deed such that what we're trying to do is really apply a patent-specific version of estoppel by deed.

It said, look, it may be harder to know whether to do estoppel when this is a pending patent claim as opposed to an issued claim. And so we're trying to answer that question with the reasoning of Westinghouse and, again, estoppel by deed.   And we think the answer is, well, you have -- that pending claim has to look like or -- or be essentially the same as the issued claim that you're now saying is invalid. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, Petitioner's counsel tried to do amendments to your proposal.   Could you respond to those, number one? And, number two, am I clear that you're really not trying to return completely to Westinghouse because Westinghouse seemed to suggest that a court assignor estoppel would reach questions of overbroad claims, and you're not -- your test doesn't reach that at all, meaning you would just look, it seems, as to the time -- the claims as claimed at the time of assignment and those issued in the patent, and you don't even get to the question of whether or not -- Justice Breyer's question, whether or not that reading is overbroad. "}, {"speaker": "Morgan L. Ratner", "text": " So, on your first question, Justice Sotomayor, in terms of Petitioner's limitations, I think we are fine with a requirement that this be rock solid.   I mean, we chose the term \"materially identical\" and think that means something. And -- and as for the second proposed limitation, they suggested that -- that there should be -- that claim should exist both at the time of the assignment from the assignor and at the time of the assignment to the person ultimately bringing the challenge.   That limitation, we don't agree with.   We think this is focused on the assignor's representation. As to your second question about claim construction, it's -- it's true that claim construction has, I think, changed to some degree over time.   Prior art tends to be relevant in narrowing a claim but only under a canon of essentially narrowing an ambiguous claim to preserve validity.   What we don't think is still viable anymore is sort of a free-standing practicing-the-prior-art defense. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, that somehow -- that, in my mind, gives credence to Petitioner's counsel that maybe the doctrine has lost its utility, because Westinghouse was really premised on a claim not dissimilar from this one, that if you read the claim in context, it would be overbroad to the description in the other claims. But you've just admitted that -- that things have gone -- have changed, how you read patents has fundamentally issued -- has fundamentally changed. "}, {"speaker": "Morgan L. Ratner", "text": " I -- I think it has changed to some degree, Justice Sotomayor, but that doesn't change the ultimate point of Westinghouse, which was you can't have a core attack on the value of something, the validity of something that the day before you may have implicitly represented has value.

I -- I don't want to say it's exclusive if there's some other unusual circumstances that would arise that would undermine the basic notion that what someone is saying at time two was inconsistent with what they're saying at time one.

Mr. Hochman said -- when I gave him what I considered to be the sort of paradigm cases of assignor estoppel and asked whether they should be estopped, he said yes, but they should be estopped under the equitable estoppel doctrine. And I take it what that would do for him is that it would impose a reliance requirement and that it would impose a sort of extra special affirmative, clear representation, so there could be nothing implicit about it, maybe he wouldn't rely on the oath.   I'm making this up a little bit. But I guess the question is, what's the difference between equitable and assignor estoppel in your mind as to these paradigmatic cases, which we think of as bait-and-switch cases, and does that difference make a difference? "}, {"speaker": "Morgan L. Ratner", "text": " I -- I think you've put your finger on the two main differences.   The first is a knowing affirmative misrepresentation, and the second is justifiable reliance on it.   And we do think that would make a -- a difference.   It would be extremely difficult to show that in most cases.   And this Court in Westinghouse specifically said, look, that's estoppel by conduct, that's not estoppel by deed.   That's page 351 of Westinghouse. And so I -- I think the Court has already made clear that that's a different branch of estoppel doctrine.   And what we're getting at here is not necessarily about one party misleading another as much as confidence and conclusiveness in a particular type of formal transaction.

And so I -- I guess my first question is, why doesn't it face the same stare decisis challenges that the Petitioner has? So that's one set of questions for you. Second is, with respect to the -- the choice of relying on estoppel by deed and the analogy to physical property, it allows -- your test would allow liability even when there's no misrepresentation of fact and the buyer, often in these cases large and sophisticated, more so than the seller, could easily determine the validity of the patent on its own and is better positioned to do so.   And you also get rid of reliance.   And I guess I don't understand why we would impose liability on statements that even you'd agree were utterly meaningless at the time. And all that points to my third question, and then I'll stop, and that is, if we're going to look at estoppel doctrine, I -- I -- I guess I'm a little confused why we would look to real -- physical real estate as the example, where deeds, recorded deeds, have a special role in our -- in our system and have a special validity, rather than personal -- personal property, where these elements, misrepresentation of facts and -- and reliance, are required, given that patents are so easily killable and challengeable in ways that physical real estate, much harder to do so.

We're talking about a different branch of estoppel doctrine.

You're just saying -- you're getting rid of it in this area. You're not getting rid of it everywhere, I accept that, but you're getting rid of it here.

So I have a question about the choice that -- the choice that we're facing here.   As Justice Breyer pointed out, you know, we can keep -- or let's just assume for the sake of this argument that I agree that stare decisis establishes that the assignor -- assignor doctrine exists. We have a choice between two bright-line rules, either we have it or we don't, or we can do this middle course that you're charting that, as you say, no court has applied before. It seems to me that your approach doesn't give us the efficiency of -- of estoppel doctrines generally.   I mean, think about Blonder Tongue, patent context, and, you know, estoppel there, issue -- issue preclusion shuts it down and makes litigation more efficient. But, here, as I take it, your proposal would probably enmire the parties in fights about what's materially identical.   I mean, would that be a battle of the experts? "}, {"speaker": "Morgan L.

If we're talking about the simple assessment of, are these claims -- are there the same claim limitations, or are there extra claim limitations added, we think that could be done in a relatively straightforward way. But I -- I would add, to the extent there are some factual questions here, we think that that's a benefit of our theory.   The problem of the -- with the Federal Circuit's theory here is that it basically treats the application of an equitable estoppel principle as an on/off switch, and -- and that's the -- the underlying problem that we're trying to resolve.

I guess I would just emphasize that what we think is the core advantage of our test, and that's that it puts intellectual property on par with other kinds of property, whereas the parties' theories would create a mismatch in one direction or the other. So Minerva, on one side, wants to eliminate assignor estoppel altogether, but that would mean that sales of real property are protected by estoppel by deed and personal property may be protected by warranties of merchantability, but there would be no analog for intellectual property. And, on the other side, the Federal Circuit and Hologic would apply a reflexive rule that covers all invalidity disputes.   But, as we discussed, that would mean that estoppel applies even in the absence of logically inconsistent positions, and that's not consistent with historical estoppel doctrines. So we think that our approach here is most consistent with Westinghouse, with that historical development of assignor estoppel, and with the animating principles behind estoppel doctrines generally.

Wolf", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1924, this Court held that assignor estoppel was manifestly intended by Congress. In the 100 years since, Congress has maintained the relevant statutory language through multiple revisions of patent law. This Court has explicitly refused to overrule the doctrine, and dozens of lower courts have applied assignor estoppel without significant incident or controversy, including recently in Diamond Scientific, which explicitly incorporated the claim construction doctrines of Westinghouse. Minerva asks this Court to disregard all of this in the service of the purportedly paramount goal of eliminating bad patents.   But patent laws have other critical objectives, including incentivizing scientific progress through the protection of patents and fostering predictability in commercial transactions. Hologic respectfully submits that, if the costs and benefits of assignor estoppel are to be reweighed, it should be Congress handling the scales.   Whether couched in the principles of stare decisis or ratification, this Court should not undermine the hundreds of thousands of still extant bargains struck against the backdrop of assignor estoppel. The bargain in this case included Mr. Truckai and his co-inventors expressly selling the rights to future patent applications.   The parties valued those rights based on the understanding that Respondent would secure whatever claims the Patent Office would allow, in this case, a claim just like the one that Mr. Truckai successfully secured allowance of with original Claim 31, and that Mr. Truckai would not subsequently challenge their validity. And if Mr. Truckai wanted a different deal, he was free to contract around assignor estoppel, per Mentor Graphics, and accept a concomitantly reduced purchase price.   But Mr. Truckai now wants to keep both the $8 million he pocketed and the right to undermine what those millions purchased.

Secondly, one thing that has changed is that the PTAB, through the America Invents Act, now allows an inventor to challenge the very thing you are concerned about, whether it be a matter of prior art or, under post-grant review, it be a matter of issues of written description or enablement. We also, Your Honor, have -- your question hinted at privity issues, and, of course, there is -- if -- if an employee goes from company A to company B and is not sufficiently directing the activities, then the privity would break the chain -- the privity analysis would break the chain and you would not have assignor estoppel. And, finally, there are -- as I noted before, if the inventor thinks that the way company A characterized his or her invention is not right, he or she can refuse to sign the oath.

So, for example, if the original '072 application had only one claim that required moisture permeability but later you change, if Mr. Truckai assigned the patent that way and you revised it deleting that reference, why should Mr. Truckai be estopped?

There is no dispute in this case that everything that's in Claim 1, the infringed claim, is identified in Mr. Truckai's application.   What he asserts is that it wasn't novel, it wasn't new. Well, if he was right, he is free to rely upon Westinghouse and Diamond Scientific's claim construction principles.   But we know in this case he's wrong, and we know he's wrong for two reasons.   First, the Patent Office originally allowed Claim 31.   And, second, they tried to institute an IPR against Claim 1, and they didn't even achieve institution.

And so you should read it in a narrower way. And that's exactly what happened in Westinghouse and -- and in any number of the assignor estoppel cases.   So that fairness correction is already built into the jurisprudence.

Lear said that Scott had undermined the basis for patent estoppel even more than Westinghouse had.   So it read Westinghouse as undermining the basis for patent estoppel.

Why wouldn't the more natural place to look at is -- is -- is just plain old estoppel with respect to personal property, rather than real estate transactions, given that, if you look at estoppel by deed, there's no need for material misrepresentations.   There's no need for reliance.

So I just want to put a pin in that. On the reliance point, when Mr. Truckai, to use our specific example, applies for a claim, when the Patent Office originally says no, and when Mr. Truckai then successfully fights for allowance of that claim, it's hard to see how that isn't a representation that can be taken seriously -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay, so you -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew M.

The Solicitor General wants to retain the doctrine of assignor estoppel but to limit it, and I want to make sure I understand your concerns about the SG's position. What -- what -- how would you describe your differences with the Solicitor General's position as articulated in the brief and today? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew M. Wolf", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   And putting aside the reliance issues and the stare decisis issues, if we were talking about ab initio what would we think about it, I -- I think there are -- if I could answer that first at the -- at the theoretical level and then give a very specific example. At the theoretical level, as worded, the SG's proposal is more stringent than the invalidity test itself.   The question the law asks when determining the validity of claims sought after an original application was -- was filed is whether they are supported by the original specification. Nowhere in the law can we find a requirement that subsequent claims be materially identical to original claims for Section 112 to be satisfied. So there's an incongruence between the policy the government is espousing, and it's a perfectly reasonable policy, if -- if -- if -- if Congress wanted to go there.   It just doesn't match up with the text. And let me give the specific example. It is common for a patent examiner to tell an applicant that claims as written will not be allowed, but they're -- if they're modified in one way or the other, the patent will issue. If the applicant takes the PTO up on its suggestion under the government's test, would that result in a loss of protection of assignor estoppel? So it's a -- it -- it -- in the real world, it presents a Hobson's Choice, as -- as phrased, given the way prosecution actually works. And, in fact, Pharma, in its amicus brief, noted the unworkability of the government's test and it said amended or newly added claims can differ from the original claims in many dimensions such that evaluating the amount of their difference would be practically impossible.   So it's a difficult test to implement. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Wolf. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Barrett.

But, for many of the same reasons the doctrine should not be abrogated, it also should not be modified by this Court. Assignees have relied on the estoppel when deciding whether, at what price, and under what terms they wish to acquire patents and patent applications. Assignors have benefitted from that reliance through the enhanced assignment value the doctrine creates, and they have also been free to reject the doctrine in whole or in part when negotiating the terms of the assignment. A retrospective change would mean a windfall for assignors and radically undercutting the return on the deal for a quarter century's worth of assignees. Any modification to assignor estoppel should be made only after careful consideration of the advantages, not just the disadvantages of the doctrine.   It should be made after input from all of the stakeholders in the marketplace.

I'm going to start from the narrow and move to the broad.   I just want to correct a couple of, I think, misstatements that -- that Mr. Wolf made. He -- he -- he said repeatedly that Claim 31 was obtained.   That's not true.   Claim 31 was canceled and it was canceled two years, two full years before Cytyc lost the patent.   So it was not -- and -- and -- and that's just the way the patent prosecution process goes. Sometimes you learn things after a claim has been given a tentative allowance by the court and -- and you have to make changes. He pointed to the testimony in -- in -- in -- in -- in the record about Truckai at one time believing that his claim was more than just moisture transport.   But that's not the same thing as covering an applicator head with a moisture-impermeable device.   Those are different points, and I think -- and I think that that -- that this is exactly the kind of backward-looking overreach that the rules should prohibit. I think Hologic's position makes Claim 31 a red herring.   It -- you know, it -- they were very clear today.   Whatever they can squeeze out of the patent, the assignor is stuck with.   And that just doesn't make any sense. You know, Scott allowed -- Scott Paper allowed a party -- an assignor to say that the patent -- that what he was doing was outside of the scope of patent protection because of the time-limited nature of patents.   There is no principled reason why an assignor shouldn't be able to say that what he's doing is outside the scope of the patent protection because it's beyond the -- it's -- it's beyond the breadth of the application that he sold. And that's our argument, and -- and -- and it's also, by the way, the argument that Westinghouse accepted, and this is toward the end of the Westinghouse opinion.   It's page 354, toward the -- toward the bottom there, when it's talking about Claim 6.   Claim 6 in that case was pending at the time of the assign -- of -- of -- of the assignment, was overbroad, and the assignor was nonetheless allowed to dispute the breadth of even narrower claims than the overbroad claim that had been pending at the time. And this is consistent, by the way, with Kimble.   Kimble says in case after case the Court has construed these laws to preclude measures that restrict free access to formerly patent -- patented as well as unpatented inventions, and it cites Scott Paper. That's the point.   If you're outside the scope of patent protection, you should be allowed to -- the inventor, even an assignor, should be allowed to challenge it. And then, final -- and -- and, in addition, the AIA and IPRs and post-grant review, that's just another reason to abandon assignor estoppel.   That's another one of the significant changes that has taken place.   The doctrine doesn't have any legs to stand on. And the -- you know, the government pushes towards the real property analogy and estoppel by deed, but it's really important to remember that assignor estoppel, unlike estoppel by deed, is committing property to the public. And so the analogy doesn't hold when -- when in -- when, in estoppel by deed, somebody is trying to take back what they had sold. But that's not true here.   What we're trying to do is ensure that they get to keep the substantial value of what we sold them but no more.   And to the extent that there's any concern about real mischievous behavior by assignors, equitable estoppel and state law remedies remain available to address them. For all those reasons, we respectfully request that you vacate the judgment and remand with instructions to consider our Section 112 invalidity arguments on the merits. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
