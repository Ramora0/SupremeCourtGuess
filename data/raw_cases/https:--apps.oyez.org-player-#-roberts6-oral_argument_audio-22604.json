[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 10-1293, Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations.   General Verrilli. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   In its previous decision in this case, the Court observed that when a broadcast licensee takes a license for the free and exclusive use of a valuable part of the public domain, it also accepts enforceable public obligations.   One of those enforceable obligations is the indecency restriction which Congress has instructed the Federal Communications Commission to enforce between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--   Respondents in this case have for years benefited enormously from their free and exclusive use of public spectrum.   They argue, however, that neither Congress nor the commission may as a condition of their licenses require that they refrain from broadcasting indecent material when children are most likely to be in the audience. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, General Verrilli, it seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only go so far.   I mean, if the idea is just, we gave them something, now they have to do whatever we say, you wouldn't accept that.   So the question is why is this condition appropriate when many other conditions would not be appropriate?   I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, if you would say all conditions are appropriate.   But I -- I frankly think you wouldn't. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " This condition is appropriate, Justice Kagan, because it has been a defining feature of the broadcast medium from its inception in the 1920s in the Radio Act and has continued to be a defining feature of this medium throughout its history.   And the argument that my friends on the other side are making here is that that norm, that legally enforceable norm which has been recognized by this Court in Pacifica and has been applied since the inception of this medium, needs to be overturned now because circumstances have changed.   And I would point out first, if I may-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " That's one of their arguments.   I mean, another one is that you haven't defined it precisely enough, right?

Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " That's certainly true, Justice Scalia, and I will certainly get to vagueness, if I -- if I may continue along this line.   Their argument is that circumstances have fundamentally changed.   I want to point out at the outset something I think is significant, which is that their argument would sweep away indecency restriction with respect to radio as well as television, and they would sweep that away in the arguments they are making today without making any showing that circumstances have changed at all with respect to the ubiquity of -- or accessibility of radio.   And I think if one looks at the FCC orders that this Court cited in its prior decision in this case, one would see that a lot of the most vile and lewd material really is in radio.   So I just want to put that marker down at the beginning here because I do think it is quite important.   No showing has been made about radio. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I didn't quite understand that.   Today there's a -- there is either a potential or a fact of violent and objectionable broadcasting in radio?   I didn't quite understand your point. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Yes.   Pacifica itself, Justice Kennedy, was a case about a radio broadcast. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Yes, I understand that.   Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " And the Respondents are arguing in this case that Pacifica ought to be overruled because the circumstances that justified its rule no longer obtain.   I want to put a marker in at the outset here with respect to radio because I do think it's quite important, that they haven't made any argument that those circumstances are any different with respect to radio.   It's just as ubiquitous as it was.   There isn't even any argument that there is blocking technology available.   I want to make sure, given the kind of vile material that the record demonstrates has been transmitted over time on radio, that the Court focuses on the breadth of the argument that the Respondents are making here.   Now, with respect to television, I do think they are making an argument that -- that television broadcasting is no longer uniquely pervasive in the way that it was before.   They are not making an argument -- but that, if I may, is a very different kind of argument than one would normally get in support of a -- the suggestion that we ought to depart from stare decisis.   They are not -- they are not arguing that broadcast television is any less pervasive than it was.   If anything, it is probably more pervasive now.   They are not arguing that the harms of that pervasiveness no longer exist.   What they are arguing is that there is other media that present harms as well, and that with respect -- and that because those other media also present harms, the circumstances require a change in the rule with respect to broadcasters.   Now that -- you can I think look at that in one of two ways.   You could say either that's an argument that it's futile to continue to impose this restriction on broadcasters, and I think that's what Fox says at page 33 of its brief.   Two points in response to that.   I think a significant if not complete answer was in this Court's prior decision in this case in which it said that the maintenance of a safe haven is actually particularly important in -- in the context of these changes, a broadcast safe haven.   And also I do think that the idea of futility in that nature is foreign to our First Amendment jurisprudence. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " General Verrilli, I took it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that the major objection is that one cannot tell what's indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor, that's saying NYPD Blue> [\"] is not.   And I do think that that is the major objection, that we have a -- a government agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity is okay and when it isn't.   You can't do it in terms of time because the NYPD> [\"] was 7 seconds and another broadcast, Catch-22> [\"], was 40 seconds.   So it's -- it's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations.   That I think is the nature of the-- "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Let me turn to that, Justice Ginsburg.   The -- two points about that.   The first one is that as we read this Court's recent decision in Humanitarian Law Project, the question on the Fifth Amendment analysis of whether there is vagueness and arbitrary enforcement has to be answered by reference to the specific broadcasts at issue here.   In other words, was there fair notice with respect to these specific broadcasts?   And I will get to that, but I -- but let me first go directly to Your Honor's more significant question.   And I think the -- the problem with looking at the case that way is that the lens is focused too narrowly, in that there actually, when one broadens out the lens and looks at the wide range of decisions that the commission is making about indecency and then broadens it out even further and looks at the wide range of broadcasts that occur, actually the number of broadcasts are -- that have been identified as even raising a question of arbitrariness or inconsistency is a -- is really quite a miniscule fraction.   It's even quite a miniscule fraction even with respect to broadcasts that the commission has adjudicated as indecent or not indecent.   And yes, we would concede that there is not perfect clarity in this rule.   It's a context-based rule.   As we read Pacifica, the Court suggested in Pacifica that the context-based rule may well be what the Constitution requires here, and that's going to result in some -- something less than absolute precision.   But the -- of course, the alternative, I would assume from my friend's perspective, would be worse.   The commission could have a list that said: Never say the following however many words, never show broadcasting between the hours of 6:00 a.m. -- nudity between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--   That would be clearer, but it would -- but in a way the commission here, I think by following the context-based approach that I think Pacifica suggested was required, is being -- \"punished\" is too strong a word, but it's being held against it that it's trying to make reasonable accommodations for First Amendment values.   And so I think when one looks at it both in terms of where the lenses actually ought to be focused here and the fact that the -- the alternative perfect clarity would reach a less effective accommodation of First Amendment values, then I do think that the commission's position is quite reasonable and sensible. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Could you -- could you digress for one minute to help me understand the procedural posture of this case.   When it was here last time, we were dealing with an issue called fleeting expletives and that was Fox.   And the Fox case involved just that.   They didn't really, or we didn't, or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now at issue.   And then without it going back to the commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground that sets aside the 2001 order.   Now, can we here just decide the fleeting expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order and has to do with part 2.2 or something.   I mean, it has -- and how you interpret the words \"material dwells on or repeats\".   Now, that I -- I understand how to get at.   The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise fleeting expletives.   It wasn't fleeting.   And it raises the question of the validity of, under vagueness grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been applied.   But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that case.   It sent it back to the commission.   So has there been a commission decision recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being made here about the validity of the 2001 industry guidance as applied?   Has there been such a thing?   Alternatively, has there been an appeals court holding on the analysis of the ABC case? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " I do -- I agree with you, Justice Breyer, A, that this is a complex procedural posture; B, that the Court would have some discretion in how it approached and resolved the case.   With respect to the ABC case, as I read the commission's orders, which are in the appendix to the petition, it applied the 2001 industry guidance to reach the conclusion that the ABC broadcast was indecent.   And then that was -- that -- then ABC appealed that to the Second Circuit, as I understand it, and that the Second Circuit then found that the commission had violated the Constitution in reaching that result. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But they didn't -- they didn't in that case, and they sent the ABC case back -- I see your-- "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " They did on -- when it came back, Your Honor, they then, they disposed of the Fox case with a lengthy opinion and then essentially applied that analysis to the ABC case.   So I think in fairness-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --All right.   When this ABC case was argued in front of the commission, I have here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are filled with very good arguments.   Were those arguments made to the commission in the context of the ABC case?   Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all.   This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided before.   This is the case of ABC, period.   And it is an attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives.   And therefore, I want to know, at least satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone through ordinary procedures and indeed these arguments have all been made in front of the commission and they have been rejected. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " --So, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure that I can vouch for the proposition that the arguments have all been made in front of the commission. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm not saying every one, but has the essence of these arguments-- "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " In fairness, I do think that if one reads the commission's disposition of the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent under the 2001 guidance.   ABC paid the fine that it was assessed, and then, as it has -- as it can do, then invoked the Hobbs Act and went to the court of appeals to challenge it.   And so I do think -- I do actually think that the issues have been considered by the agency and are before the Court.   And I do agree with Your Honor, moving I think more directly to the vagueness point, that there really isn't a vagueness issue left with respect to the fleeting expletives in the Fox case, because the Court said the last time the case was here that there is no problem of arbitrary punishment because there was no forfeiture or any other sanction.   ABC is in a different position because they were sanctioned.   And so there is an issue with respect to the question of whether the commission's indecency standards can constitutionally be applied here and whether they are too vague.   But I do think, and I would like to spend a minute on that question of whether there is vagueness as applied to the ABC broadcast.   Now, the commission's standards in the 2001 guidance say that this is essentially a two-part test.   First is a subject matter question: Is there a description or depiction of sexual or excretory activities or organs?   And then there is the question of whether the depiction or description is patently offensive under community standards for broadcast informed by three factors: Whether the expression is explicit; whether the broadcast dwells on it; and whether it's shocking or pandering or titillating.   Now, ABC makes an argument with respect to this broadcast that the nudity in the NYPD Blue> [\"] episode is outside of the first subject matter criteria because it didn't have fair notice that buttocks would be considered sexual organs for purposes of application of this -- of this standard.   The commission said, and this is at page 137a of the appendix to the petition, that it's impossible to believe that they didn't think that the naked display of buttocks would bring them within -- that they didn't have fair notice that the naked display of buttocks would bring them within this rule.   I'm not sure anything more needs to be said about that. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, the broader point, General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if you are right that there are many non-vague applications of this commission policy, that there is some amount of uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of uncertainty-- "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " I don't-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --because it turns out that nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as to some body parts and sometimes it's not allowed, and the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 50 years, and the length of time doesn't seem to be what's indicative of anything, the kind of body part doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what is indicative of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " --With respect, Justice Kagan, I really disagree with that characterization of the situation.   Moving to the second part of the analysis here, I think it's important to take a half a step back.   The fact of the matter is, and I think everybody, all of us, understands in our experience, that nudity on broadcast television is an exceedingly, exceedingly rare thing at any time of the day, and certainly between 6:00 a.m. and 10 p.m. It is exceedingly rare, and all of us from our experience know that.   And the-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --Well, I'm not so sure, because the examples were given of I guess excerpts from \"Private Ryan\" and from \"Schindler's List\", have been on television. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " --Yes, that's true, Justice Ginsburg.   But again I think that's another issue about where the lens is focused.

It said that monologue was readily identifiable as indecent because it was a dramatic departure from the customary norms for the broadcast medium.   I think the kind of nudity -- and I think if one just looks at the video here and sees it, I think it's hard to disagree with the proposition that that is a dramatic departure from what's the norm for broadcast television.

And it's not apparent to many people which are broadcast and which are not.   But you're saying that there's still a value, an importance, in having a higher standard or different standard for broadcast media on the television.   Why is that, when there are so many other options, and -- and when it's not apparent to many viewers which of the two they're watching?

I think that -- I want to get to what I think is the fundamental point here, that whatever may be the case with respect to the ability of a viewer to differentiate whether something is a broadcast channel or a cable channel, the reality is that broadcasters are in a different position by virtue of the fact that they have a license from the government that comes with this enforceable public obligation that allows the government to create this safe haven, and that puts them in a different position. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, in a way, that's circular.   That's what we're here to argue about.   I'm asking, is there a functional, pragmatic, practical difference between the two? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Is there -- well, I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.   The V-Chip works with both broadcast and cable transmissions, to the extent it works.   The -- what the briefs have pointed out -- and I would suggest in particular that the Court look at the brief from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which does a very thorough job in explaining the many ways in which the V-Chip has proven to be a deficient technology.   A lot of it goes to the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the codes, the labels that the programmers put in to begin with, which have to be there in order for the V-Chip to decide what gets through and what doesn't.   And I would point out in this very case, for example, with respect to the -- for example, the 2003 Billboard Music Awards broadcast with the Paris Hilton-Nicole Richie back and forth, one would never have known from the code affixed for the V-Chip purpose that that broadcast was going to have those kinds of words in them.

First of all, the idea that it, quote, 2001, even I would say until 2004, when the commission wildly changed its approach.   And it's only become dysfunctional since 2004.

The first one is to revert back to the prior enforcement regime that existed before 2004, which deferred to reasonable judgments, was restricted to material that is not momentary exposure but is dwelled upon.   And that as Pacifica explained, was egregious material akin to depictions of erotic activity.   The second thing they could do is make this three-factor test -- or however many factors it is -- a test, not just a nonexclusive list of an infinite number of factors that could or couldn't be balanced in any way the commission wants to.   Even if it wants to leave it as factors -- and this is number 3 -- it could at least identify what they are, and apply them consistency -- consistently through adjudication that explains why one over-balances the other, which it certainly did not do in this case.

What it faced in the 1980's, with that being the outer bound of the commission's authority, was the explosion of the shock jock phenomenon, Howard Stern and Bubba the Love Sponge and the rest of it which didn't use any of the seven words in the Carlin monologue, but which was highly vile and lewd, and it required the commission to make a judgment.   Now, that was all advertising sponsored broadcast.   And so I do think the risk of the race to the bottom is real, and I think history is showing it.

And, it's, you know, evident in the notion that this -- the way that this policy seems to work, it's like nobody can use dirty words or nudity except for Steven Spielberg and that there's a lot of room here for FCC enforcement on the basis of what speech they think is kind of nice and proper and good.

Second, I do think if one looks at the corpus of decisions that the commission has made about what is indecent and what isn't, I think one can see with respect to the large majority of them, the vast majority of them that it is clear which side of the line something fell on.   Yes, there is isn't perfect clarity, there are going to be some hard cases, but they really have identified where is, in the great scheme of things, a trivial number of hard cases.   I don't think one can say that this is a situation like in Reno which there is effectively no standard at all.   In Reno, this Court distinguished the Pacifica situation eight ways to Sunday, and I think we've identified them in our brief and those are valid.   I do think there is a significant problem with thinking about Pacifica as the outer bound of the commission's authority under the First Amendment in addition to the shock jock problem.

One is the delaying bleeping technology, Justice Ginsburg, and the other one is that there is a scienter requirement under the commission's enforcement authority here.
