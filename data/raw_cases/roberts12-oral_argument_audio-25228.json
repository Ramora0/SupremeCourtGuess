[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh is participating remotely today. We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 20-826, Brown versus Davenport. Ms. Hammoud. "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Davenport's concession that Brecht doesn't always subsume AEDPA narrows the dispute here.   But the modified Brecht-only approach, he suggests, gives no deference to state courts' merits adjudications and absolves habeas petitioners of their burden under 2254(d)(1). Even if federal judges relied only on material permissible under AEDPA within its Brecht analysis, the inquiry is not over.   It is not enough for federal judges to believe in their own minds that an error substantially influenced the verdict.   Before granting relief, they must look through AEDPA's highly deferential lens and ask whether all other fair-minded jurists would disagree with the state court's conclusion. When Congress enacted AEDPA, it did not give federal judges the option of ignoring this crucial deference.   That is why, as a precondition to habeas relief, they must apply both Brecht and AEDPA.   Failing to do so contravenes this Court's modern habeas jurisprudence, including Ayala, which reaffirmed that AEDPA's -- that AEDPA's limitations are distinct from Brecht. The Sixth Circuit's Brecht-only approach failed to defer to the Michigan courts. It also extended this Court's holdings, relied on circuit precedent, conducted an independent review of the record, and used extrajudicial social science studies, all of which are prohibited under AEDPA.   As Judge Thapar said in his en banc dissent, federal judges can't simply ignore AEDPA's guardrails whenever they find actual prejudice under Brecht. We ask this Court to articulate the correct standard and to reverse the Sixth Circuit. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " If you were writing on a clean slate, how would you coordinate Brecht and AEDPA? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " One, in -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Would you say that -- for example, that one subsumes the other? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " In a case of denial, in a case of denial of relief, applying the other would be a mere formality.   Esparza, this Court found that the state court's conclusion -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So it really wouldn't matter if you deny? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " If you -- if you denied, applying the other would not -- formally applying it would not matter because it would be a mere formality.   However, if a court were to grant relief under either, it must go to the next test.   So, if they were to grant relief under Brecht, as the Sixth Circuit did, it must apply AEDPA as a precondition to the grant of relief. And if a state court used the -- the wrong standard or it was contrary to this Court's precedent, then, if a petitioner prevails under AEDPA, Brecht must be applied as well prior to relief, Your Honor.   I hope that answered your question. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Why -- that's how you think it would be applied, but why would a rational legislature set the system up this way? In other words, okay, let's have this inquiry under Brecht.   Then let's have this separate inquiry under -- under AEDPA. Would somebody just sitting down on a -- on a clean slate put that system together? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Well, one, we know that they are different tests.   They're distinct tests.   They ask different questions.   And when Congress enacted 2254(d)(1), that was three years after Brecht.   So Brecht could never consider the limitations that AEDPA set in place. And Brecht -- Brecht applies whether or not there's a state court determination.   So they're not two of the same.   Each hold different burdens as well.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, if that's really -- if they sat down and decided that's what we're going to do, don't you think they would have made it a little clearer than to have us sitting here now and saying, well, how do -- how do we reconcile these two things? Because, you know, they're addressed to the same question, I guess, at a broad level. In other words, it would seem to me odd that they would leave it implicit that AEDPA and Brecht would coexist. "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " They -- they have to coexist because when -- when -- 2254 specifically applies to a state court's merits determination.   Brecht doesn't need a state court's merits adjudication for it to apply, and we know that this Court said in -- in Fry that on collateral review, whether there's a state court's merits adjudication or not, Brecht applies on collateral review. Now, once there is a state court's merits adjudication, that was the heart of AEDPA, was to protect that, and that's the basic structure. Now that there is a state court merits adjudication, then that needs to be protected, and it can't be ignored and it doesn't offer a menu of options.   We must give it deference. And so they do ask different questions, and as Judge Thapar said, different questions often lead to different answers. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Ms. Hammoud, do we have to -- "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " -- overrule Ayala to side with you, and if not, how do we handle that \"subsumes\" language in Ayala? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " The Court does not have to overrule Ayala because the question that's presented here was never asked in Ayala.   And, in fact, in Ayala, the Court applied both, and the Court made clear that AEDPA is a precondition to relief.   And in Ayala, the Court did not grant relief. So, in terms of the \"subsumes\" language, I think that the Court can clarify that if a federal court were to grant relief under Brecht, we ask this Court to do exactly and say what it said -- reiterate AEDPA's limitations, that AEDPA remains a precondition to relief. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What is your understanding of the meaning of the term \"subsume\"? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Your Honor, we know that it can't mean ignore or make null.   However, our reading of it is it could subsume, which means a court does not have to formally apply AEDPA if the petitioner was not entitled to relief under Brecht, doesn't have to go through a separate application, because there is no grant of relief in that case.   So it kind of subsumed that conclusion, that decision -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if I look up the definition in the dictionary, will I find something like this, include as a component? Is that a meaning of the -- of the term \"subsume\"? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " And I know that the definition, Your Honor, has been debated with what does it mean, right? Judge Readler said it can't mean consume.   Certainly, the Sixth Circuit thinks that it means you can completely leapfrog -- that AEDPA would all -- that AEDPA would be -- all of AEDPA's limitations would be included in Brecht and that a federal court could leapfrog and ignore AEDPA. We know that at least it can't mean that, which is why I think this case is a -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, it means include as a component.   And so, if 2254(d) is included as a component of Brecht, then doesn't that mean that a court purporting to apply Brecht still has to satisfy 2254(d)? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " They're not two of the same.   And, you know, when we -- when we look at the two tests differently, we know that Brecht doesn't answer -- doesn't ask the questions that AEDPA asks. One, they're distinct.   One is an independent review as to what, as this Court said in O'Neal, me as a federal court judge believe in my own mind, and as opposed to AEDPA, they have to look and ask the question, is there fair-minded disagreement on this? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, sometimes judicial opinions can -- can -- can confuse things, so maybe it's helpful to go back to first principles. Isn't federal habeas relief entirely statutory except in those circumstances in which there would otherwise be a suspension of the writ? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " And, yes, but this Court's -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yes.   Okay.   The answer to that is yes, 2254(d) is a statute.   On what basis could a federal court say, we're not going to follow 2254(d), we're going to follow a judicially created standard in Brecht? What do you understand to have been the basis for Brecht? Was it -- it wasn't in the federal habeas statute at that time, was it? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " No, Your Honor.   In fact, this Court -- one, they must -- they must both apply the federally mandated congressional statute -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It was an -- "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " -- and -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- understanding -- it was our understanding, it was our application of the equity that a federal court exercises when it provides federal habeas relief.   It was an equitable rule that was read into the previous statute, the previous version of the statute. And so, if there were a conflict between that and a subsequently enacted statute, which would prevail? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " They must both prevail because Brecht does not need a state court's merits adjudication in order to apply.   And, two, both of them can exist at the same time, especially on collateral review. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I do think, Ms. Hammoud, that the language in Davis v. Ayala and also in Fry, which Davis v. Ayala quotes and refers to as a holding, that that language goes, you know, something like this: It -- it says, we've looked at these two tests, and what we think is that the stricter standard is the -- the -- "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Brecht. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- Brecht standard. "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And so, if a court does Brecht, that's good enough for us.   If a court does Brecht only, that's good enough for us. Now you might contest that.   You might say, well, that was too hasty to just say that Brecht is stricter in all circumstances.   But, in fact, that's what the Court twice said.   It said in no uncertain terms that the one subsumes the other because the Brecht test is stricter than the Chapman test, so if a court does the Brecht test, it's sufficient. That's the way I view -- I read and I think as the only way to read both of these decisions.   Now I -- I understand the point that they were wrong in saying that.   I mean, I understand the argument you're making, but -- but they say what they say, don't they? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Justice Kagan, that is correct.   That language was included in Fry, and -- and as Your Honor stated, Brecht and Chapman were compared in Fry.   And, in fact, in Fry, there was no harmless error determination by a state subject to deference in Fry with no AEDPA overlay. What our position is, is that when there is an AEDPA overlay, that's distinct from Fry.   Sure, when one is comparing Brecht and Chapman, you can compare into which one is friendlier to a -- a criminal defendant. However, the AEDPA overlay asks different questions, and that is not what that specific judge thinks but whether there is fair-minded disagreement. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I hear you on that.   I hear you.   But what -- what I'm suggesting is that that's an argument that could have been made to the Davis v. Ayala court, it's an argument that could have been made to the Fry court, but that the language in both of those cases essentially rejects that argument. It basically says: Look, we think that the Brecht standard is -- you know, that it -- it's just going to do all the work here, so we think that the Brecht standard is enough. "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " This Court in Fry did not consider this question, and this Court in Ayala did not consider this question.   In fact, this Court in Ayala specifically stated that Fry did not abrogate AEDPA. And this Court has repeatedly stated that the two tests are distinct, not only with different burdens as well in terms of who carries the burden under each test.   We know that this -- from this Court that the state court's ruling has to have been so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fair-minded disagreement.

Why shouldn't we hold you to your earlier concession? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Your Honor, when -- when we filed our briefing in district court, in the district court's adjudication and review of our case, their decision was that the Michigan court of appeals was the last reasoned decision based on their analysis. And since then, we have carried that position, but we've always said, whichever one, they still deserve deference.   And in our briefing, we -- we did state that after reconsideration of that legal question, it's the Michigan court of appeals' decision that's the last reasoned decision because that's what deference is.   You have to take them at their word.   They made a decision not to decide the case, and they denied leave to appeal. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But they offered -- I mean, they -- it -- it's unusual in that they didn't take the case, but they also had a bit of an opinion.   I mean, they -- they offered some views about the merits. "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " Yes.   They -- and they offered that at the end of their denial.   And our courts often -- sometimes -- and -- and -- and sometimes they don't, and sometimes they do -- offer guidance to lower courts.   And in Michigan, that's consistent not -- not just with our state laws but with this Court's jurisprudence as to the fact that even if they offer guidance at the end, that's not considered to be the last merits adjudication on the case. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   My difficulty with this case is I believe that you understand it, and I believe that the lawyers in front of me understand it, and my colleagues spent time on it.   So did I. And I have a terrible time understanding where all these different standards are and how they fit together.   But -- and I doubt that a lot of habeas judges will understand it either.   Maybe they will, but many will not no matter what we say. So I began to think of how could we deal with this.   The problem comes up -- "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " And, Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- because Brecht says, if you're the habeas person, you want habeas, I have to find, me, the habeas judge -- "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- you have proved that it was harmful.   Right? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " That's correct, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No problem.   But the state court, the DA there, what she did was prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it wasn't harmless -- or, wait a minute -- "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " That it wasn't harmful. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- prove beyond a reasonable -- prove that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. And so then you get where Justice Kagan was and you say: But that's just contradictory.   Ahh, not quite, because we've said that when you look at that state court decision, as long as a reasonable jurist could have found that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, it has to stand up. What's my problem? I think it was harmful, but I can't bring myself to say that no reasonable jurist could have agreed with that person over in the state court.   And so you say that's what we should apply. Now I have an idea.   The purpose of this whole thing is to get the habeas judge to pay some attention to what they did on this in the district court, in the federal -- in the state court.   That's the purpose, isn't it? Pay attention, federal habeas judge, to the fact that those are good judges over there too, and they came out the opposite.   You say it was harmful, but they said no reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, it was -- it was harmless. Pay attention to it. So why don't we just say that? Why don't we just say this is one of the questions where, if you ever have such a situation, federal habeas judge, please pay some attention? And instead of writing it in a legal standard that no one can understand, just tell them what to do: Pay some attention. Now I grant you that would leave it all up to them.   It would be very hard to review.   But we leave lots of things to district judges.   And there we get our objective: Pay attention to the fact that the state court did come out the opposite on this than you did. What about that? "}, {"speaker": "Fadwa A. Hammoud", "text": " This Court has already done that.   This Court in Richter has specifically stated federal judges can't use this test as a test of its -- its own confidence in the result they would reach in a de novo review, that they cannot grant petitions because merely they disagree with the state court's harmlessness determination.

"}, {"speaker": "Tasha Bahal", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Brecht and AEDPA/Chapman are both preconditions to habeas relief and both standards have been met here.   Mr. Davenport was actually prejudiced by the unconstitutional shackling, as the court of appeals found under Brecht.   The state has not sought review of that Brecht determination before this Court.   The finding of actual prejudice necessarily means the state court adjudication on the merits was an unreasonable application of the Chapman standard. There is a clear and logical relationship between Brecht and AEDPA/Chapman, with Brecht setting the higher hurdle.   Chapman requires the state to prove on direct review the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. That means the state must show there was no reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict. AEDPA then asks whether a fair-minded jurist could agree with that Chapman determination.   Brecht, in turn, asks whether there is more than a reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict. Comparing the standards, where there is more than a reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict, as is the case here, no fair-minded jurist could agree there is no reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict. Put differently, a fair-minded jurist confronted with more than a reasonable possibility of harm could not find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.   That relationship between the standards was recognized by this Court in Fry and again in Ayala, and it's also been recognized in the practical experience of federal courts applying these standards for more than 20 years. Through multiple rounds of briefing, the state has never identified a single case in which Brecht was satisfied but AEDPA/Chapman was not satisfied.   Therefore, where a finding of actual prejudice under Brecht has been made and that finding does not rest on sources of law that would not be permissible to consider under 2254(d), the Brecht inquiry answers the AEDPA questions. I'd now be happy to take the Court's questions.

We want to make sure that that determination is unreasonable, that there's no reasonable jurist out there. That's a totally different inquiry. And the same with respect to the materials that are before it.   Yes, state -- you know, you may have looked at a wide range of materials, you, the federal habeas judge, and made your determination.   AEDPA says, for review, we want to look at only the Supreme Court cases.   We don't care about the lower courts.   It -- it elevated the importance of the state court determination. So the idea that it's informal or -- or, you know, you could -- they -- they ask the same question, I think -- and it's -- maybe I'm just repeating Justice Alito's point, but they don't ask the same question. "}, {"speaker": "Tasha Bahal", "text": " They -- they ask the question as to whether what the state court did was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. In this case, where the underlying constitutional violation requires Chapman, that is a very different review than when the underlying determination is, for instance, sufficiency under Jackson or inefficient of counsel under Strickland.   Both Jackland -- Jackson and Strickland require deference to the state, and then, when you add AEDPA on top of that, this Court has called that dual deference. When you're applying Chapman as the underlying standard, that requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless.   It's a -- it's a question, as this Court called it in need -- in the Neder case, whether the evidence could rationally lead to a different verdict.   If it could, then reversal is required.

So you're advocating this hybrid thing, which seems to me kind of confusing.   That's not really what Brecht said. So why not, just for the sake of clarity, to make it -- you know, as Justice Breyer's pointed out, it's hard to unpack all this.   For the sake of clarity, why not just tell courts apply both, kind of explain it like Judge Easterbrook did, apply AEDPA, and even if AEDPA's relitigation bar would permit it, you know, apply Brecht too, and they have to pass both in order to get relief?

That is not the Chapman test. That was a standard from this Court's opinion in Holbrook that applied to determine if there was a constitutional violation by having four uniformed officers sitting behind the bar in the courtroom.   That is not what should have been applied here. My friend on the other side agrees that Chapman is the underlying law.   So formal -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

This Court has made clear, first in Holbrook and again in Deck, that relying on juror testimony as to whether the effect of shackles affected their verdict is unreliable because a juror will not always be aware of the effect of seeing a defendant in shackles.   It has sort of a subconscious effect on the jurors. And so it is not at all surprising that a juror was not able to testify on the remand proceedings that -- that, yes, I saw the shackles and, yes, they affected the verdict. This Court recognized in Holbrook and Deck that the effect of shackling is implicit in the juror and they will not be able to articulate the reasons why the shackling is prejudicial.

If the state court's issued a ruling on the harmlessness question under Chapman, then you apply AEDPA.   If the state court did not issue a ruling on the merits of the harmlessness question, then you apply Brecht. So not really applying both in every case but first making that determination, did the state court actually conduct a harmlessness analysis.   If so, AEDPA.   If not, Brecht. Anything to say for that approach? "}, {"speaker": "Tasha Bahal", "text": " The -- the statute itself requires where there is an adjudication on the merits that AEDPA will apply.   Here, both sides agree there was an adjudication on the merits. And so the 2254(d) question does apply, as does Brecht.

It was a test to determine whether there was a constitutional violation in the first place. The state concedes in their briefing that it was not a harmless error test.   The test to be applied, as we all agree, was the Chapman test.   There's no indication from the supreme court opinion that they applied Chapman.   They certainly didn't cite it, and there's no indication that they applied it at all.   They did not hold the state to that burden of proving the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. If there are no further questions, I would ask this Court to please affirm. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I guess I have one further one.

If I may, I'd like to address Justice Thomas's and Justice Alito's question in terms of which takes precedent when there's a congressional mandate.   And when there is a state court merits application -- adjudication, this is the way we believe the test should work because that is the basic structure of AEDPA. If this -- if there is a state merit -- state court merits adjudication, then they must start with AEDPA first.   The point that we were trying to make is let's say a petitioner prevails because a state court used the wrong test, for example, stated that Chapman is not beyond a reasonable doubt but by probable cause standard. The petitioner then wouldn't go to a direct Chapman -- pure Chapman application. Then, as the Court in -- stated in Fry, Brecht would apply.   So, in terms of what the Court should articulate, if there is a state court merits adjudication, then AEDPA's highly deferential standards kicks in and it makes -- it makes sense that they should start there. And if a petitioner prevails under AEDPA, then we move over to the next test.   I know that my friend had stated that the Sixth Circuit did just that when they asked -- when -- when they asked the question in Brecht, and, again, that's an independent question, we know me as a judge. We have to take the Sixth Circuit at their word when they specifically stated that the answer in the circuit is that Brecht is always the test and there is no reason to ask whether the state court unreasonably applied Chapman. So to say that Brecht encompasses AEDPA is simply not true because, again, they ask different questions.   And in this -- in this specific case and in cases to follow, it is important that this Court, like the tests that -- that have been suggested, when there is a state court merits adjudication, we start with AEDPA/Chapman.   If a petitioner prevails, then you move over to Brecht. But what happened here, if a state court finds that there is substantial or an injurious effect on the verdict, I think that that's already been articulated.   The question is different. Just because I, a federal judge, disagreed or even as this Court's jurisprudence had articulated, if -- if I, a federal judge, believe they are wrong, they must still ask the question, is it beyond all fair-minded disagreement, or could fair -- fair-minded, not biased, fair-minded jurists agree with the state court's conclusion?

The standard in Brecht is so much higher than the standard in Chapman that even when you import that level of deference, what the Court said in Ayala, what the Court said in Fry is even when you import some deference, the stand -- there's such a gap between the Chapman and the Brecht standard that the Brecht standard is necessarily going to be the greater one.

And that's what we're asking the Court to do here today because those differences matter and because there is confusion and tension.
