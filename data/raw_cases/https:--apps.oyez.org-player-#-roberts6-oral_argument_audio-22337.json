[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next this morning in Case 10-1399, Roberts v. Sea-Land Services.   Mr. Gillelan. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Dana Roberts was injured and shortly thereafter became disabled in the course of his work for Sea-Land in fiscal year 2002, but he was not awarded compensation until fiscal year 2007.   The question presented here is whether the maximum weekly rate established by section 6 of the Longshore Act that was in effect at the time his disability began or that which was in effect at the time he was awarded compensation governs his case.   He is entitled to whichever maximum is the applicable one.   Section 6(c) of the act provides explicitly that the applicable maximum is that in effect at the time that the claimant is \"newly awarded compensation\".   The term 19(e) of the act, which is described in section 19(e) as \"the order making the award\". "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It seems to me that -- that the two parties are at extremes and that there is indeed something in the middle.   I mean, you say it has to be the determination of entitlement to compensation by the agency.   The other side says: No, it's just entitlement, whether it's been decreed or not.   Why -- why wouldn't it be an award, however, if it was the employer that voluntarily paid the amount due, which is what he's supposed to do anyway, right?   Why wouldn't that be an award of compensation? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Well, because the statute -- in some sense of the word \"award\"-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes, a sense that -- that the text would bear, as opposed to the -- to the sense that the other side argues here. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --I think that the text will not bear that reading, in particular because the payments that you are describing that could be considered an award are described throughout the act as payments \"without an award\".   Now, how the claimant can have been newly awarded benefits at the time the employer makes a payment \"without an award\" I think defies the meaning of that word. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Where -- well, I wish you would submit the sections of the act that use it that way, that say compensation without an award. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Section 14(a) through (e) refers to compensation payments without an award. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Those are the provisions.   Section 14(a) and (b) directs those payments without an award. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And the -- and the critical time, then -- I think, isn't it true that most compensation payments are the -- are as a result of voluntary action by the employer and not a proceeding? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " That is true, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So then in those cases, when the employer says, okay, I will voluntarily make this compensation available, then the measuring -- the -- the pay would be measured by the time the employer makes -- makes the compensation available, right? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " I think not, because the -- the statutory provision says it's the award that is determinative. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, it's-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But there's no award. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " But there can be an award.   I think that's the critical-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But we have -- what is -- I mean, it can be.   But here's a person who has been injured and gets compensation without having to bring any legal proceeding for it.   What is the weekly -- the measure then?   It can't be an award, the date of the award, because there is no award.   So what is it? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --The employer that wants to lock in this year's maximum rate and not have his liability progress above that simply needs to have an award entered. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --No, he doesn't.   No, he doesn't.   He can just begin payment.   The -- (c), which is the section we are talking about here, doesn't just provide for newly awarded compensation.   It also says   \"survivors currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits. \"   \"Currently receiving\".   Now, does that mean it has to have been decreed by the agency?   I don't think so. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " That provision, which -- that clause-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " That clause. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --that separate clause, which is not in this case, because-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I understand.   But it -- but it applies to the question, it seems to me, that Justice Ginsburg asked, doesn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --No, I think not. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " No? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " The function of that clause is that in permanent total and death cases, because there is an annual escalator provision, whatever your rate is this year going to go up.   If it's permanent total or death case, it is going to go up each October 1st by the increase in the national average wage. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But only if you have been receiving compensation. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " If you -- if-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Okay?   If neither the employment -- if neither the employer gives you the compensation voluntarily nor as you -- as you contend, there has been an award by the agency, you are out; (c) doesn't apply.   Right? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --I wouldn't say (c) doesn't apply, no.   I think-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " How else would it apply?   You are either receiving compensation, which I would understand to mean receiving it from the employer or by reason of an award, or else you have been newly awarded compensation, which I guess means it hasn't yet been paid, but -- but you have the award in your pocket. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --Well, the -- the function of that separate clause is for cases in which an award has been entered of death benefits or permanent total disability benefits, and everything up to that point is governed by the maximum that is in effect at the time of that-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It doesn't say that, counsel.   It says \"survivors currently receiving compensation\".   It doesn't say by virtue of an award.   It says \"receiving compensation\".   So if the employer is paying it voluntarily, you are in there.   And then it goes on and it contrasts with receiving compensation those newly awarded compensation.   You are not yet receiving it, but you have been awarded it. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --Well, Mr. Roberts did not fall within the currently receiving compensation-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I understand that.   But I'm just trying to make sense out of the provision.   And it doesn't seem to me to make any sense unless you read it just the way I suggested. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --Okay.   I hope I can provide that sense.   The function of that separate clause is that a claimant who has been awarded compensation at a given rate, which is the maximum at the time of the award, will continue to receive compensation-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It doesn't say that.   It says nothing about an award.   The last part talks about an award.   It says   \"currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits. \"   And if you are receiving it from your employer, I don't know why that isn't covered by that.   Why isn't it covered? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --I can certainly see that those terms would appear to apply to that situation in which the employer is paying compensation for death or for permanent total disability.   That wouldn't provide us for a maximum -- any applicable maximum. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I don't think it affects your case.   It's just a matter of understanding what this provision is talking about. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes.   And what I'm trying to say about the function of this clause is that a claimant who has been awarded compensation for permanent total disability -- let's assume the employer hasn't paid anything until the ALJ issues an award, and at the time that award is issued the maximum is $1,000 a week and the employer was -- the employee was making more than 1500, so that maximum is the rate. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But if the employer has been paying voluntarily, you don't penalize the employee for not having an award, right?   I mean he's in the same position; the employer has conceded the liability. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " He certainly is not in the same position, no. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, would Justice Scalia's reading in your judgment -- accept his proposition that those currently receiving voluntary payments from the employer fall under subsection (c).   Would his reading require the employer every year to recalculate the benefits to the maximum that's established that year? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes, it would. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And that's why his reading-- "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " And that is precisely the function of that clause. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --The function of (b) is to set a maximum that will control all payments present and future. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes, yes, definitely. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And so if you read it the way he does, that maximum would change each year. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes.   And for permanent total disability and death cases-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I don't understand why that's so only for employment -- for employer payments and not the case for awards.   If that's so for the employer's payment, why isn't it so for awards that have been decreed?   Why don't they change every year? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --They do.   If the award is for permanent total disability or for death, they do. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Okay, so then my reading makes perfect sense. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes, your reading does make perfect sense.   And the function of that second -- the clause for those currently receiving compensation for permanent total or death, is that even when the maximum continues to go up after the date of an award that new maximum is the applicable one for the continuing period of disability or survivorship. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " When -- one of the arguments on the other side that I thought made some sense was the idea that you should focus on a particular point in time when you are figuring out what the amount of the award is going to be; that it doesn't make -- that it's at least odd to say, well, we're going to calculate how much you're entitled to at this point, but in terms of the applicable maximum we are going to wait however long it takes and calculate that as of this point.   Doesn't it make more sense to figure out the applicable numbers at the same point in time? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Marginally more sense, perhaps so.   But that is an argument that should be addressed to Congress.   Congress could easily have made section 6(c) turn on the time of injury.   Instead they had provided very explicitly-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So if we think -- if we think the statute -- in other words, your argument, your response is that the statute is unambiguous and it can't be read in a more sensical way. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --Yes.   Yes. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes, and that each use of the term \"award\", contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view, is consistent with that.   That is, whenever Congress refers in this statute to an award or compensation being awarded, it is talking about the order making the award as its described in section 19(e). "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You don't really have to establish that, do you?   All you have to establish is that there is no way in which newly awarded compensation means entitlement to compensation.   That's all you have to establish. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " That is exactly true. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You don't have to show that it's used consistently throughout, only that it's never used to mean entitlement to compensation. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " That is exactly correct. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Are you conceding in answer to these questions that your reading doesn't really make any sense, that's just what Congress -- that's what Congress did? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " No, I hope I am not conceding that. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, what sense does it make?   Why should the ceiling depend on whether an employee is getting compensation voluntarily from the employer or as a result of a formal award?   If you have two identical, identically situated employees and one is getting the compensation without an award and one is getting it with an award, as you understand the term \"award\", why -- what sense does it make to treat them differently? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " I would say they certainly are not identically situated.   The claimant who has an award-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " They are identically situated in every respect except one.   One has a formal award, one does not.   What sense does it make to treat them differently?

"}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Counsel, if I understood your response to my prior line of questioning, you deny that they are treated differently.   The one who is receiving compensation is treated the same, under the same provision.   There are two parts to it: Survivors currently receiving compensation and survivors newly awarded compensation.   Those two classes are treated exactly the same.   The only one that is treated differently is somebody who is neither being paid by the employer nor has yet received an award. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " No? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " No, no.   The clause that depends on whether you are currently receiving only applies to permanent total disability and death cases.   In all other cases, the clause that says \"newly awarded\" is the only applicable provision. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I see.   Partial disability, in other words. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " And temporary total.   Temporary total has -- the rates do not go up each year. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Would you then go back -- I did have the same question Justice Alito asked and I would like to hear the answer.   The answer has -- I will add one footnote, perhaps, which might make it a more complete answer, and that is that it makes very little sense to me when a worker becomes disabled on January 1, 1990, for example, he is now disabled.   And so we calculate what his wage was.   His wage was $200 a week.   And now we say, but that shouldn't exceed twice the average weekly wage, and we are not going to apply it to him.   You are going to apply it to him at some random date.   His wage that he is getting paid is figured out as of January 1, 1990. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But the maximum that it could be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he finishes a proceeding.   Now, I just -- for both reasons, why would you distinguish and why would you get that result?   For those two reasons it doesn't seem to make much sense to me, your reading of it, while theirs does make sense.   Now, you explain why that is. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Okay.   I think the point is to encourage the employer to get an award entered promptly, because that way they will lock in that early maximum rate or minimum rate.   The minimum rate provision applies exactly the same way under section 6(c). "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I thought Congress wanted the system to operate so that people just did it voluntarily without an award. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Well, they want that to happen as often as possible, but the employer has the right in any case to file a notice with the Department of Labor saying, we do not believe the claimant is entitled to compensation. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Counsel, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.   I mean, it seems to me you have to acknowledge that it would be a much better statute had it been written differently.   And really your argument here is it's not up to us to revise the inadequacies of a statute.   I mean, your argument is you just can't read the language that way.   And it provides a stupid result.   And there are such things as stupid statutes and this is one of them, right? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " I don't think it's stupid, but yes, my basic argument is-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You think it is not stupid because you think it is a good idea to give a lot of work to the Department of Labor and that all the employers are going to do this voluntarily and there will never be a problem with it; all should be encouraged to go and get a certificate from the Department of Labor.   All right.   I will take that as something.   Now, why is it I can't read the statute the way that it seems to make somewhat more sense?   I don't see any words here that stop me from reading it. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --\"Newly awarded compensation\" are the critical words. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Where exactly?   You mean in (c)? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " In (c), yes, 6(c). "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You just told me that just this had to do with permanent or total disability, and this is far-- "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " No.   Excuse me.   The other clause of that provision, the one that says \"currently receiving compensation\", that one only applies to survivors and permanent totally disabled workers. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --Why don't they both?   I mean, as I read it naturally, it says that -- we now have a special thing, you know, which these people are the dead ones and the widows are getting it and the permanently disabled people, and the -- this individual, and the secretary, the secretary or his delegate is going to calculate this thing all the time, and they've got a special thing here for -- for -- for permanent people, permanently disabled, and they are saying as to those people, we are giving them a break.   They can't look for more work.   They can't look for -- they are dead, for example, and they can't find other sources of income.   And so we say that, that if the average wage goes up and their wage was higher to begin with, we will raise it a bit.   And that applies not only to the people who are just getting this for the first time in the relevant period; it also applies to all those who have been getting it.   It applies to both groups.   Well, that makes sense to me. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " For permanent total disability and death, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Right.   So the whole thing applies just to the permanently disabled and the death things.   What says it applies to anybody else? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " No, the -- the clause-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " The whole thing.   The whole -- the whole -- all of (c), that's in my thing here that's seven lines.   All of (c) applies to permanently disabled and those who died. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --Well, that's certainly -- no one has put forward that construction, and that would mean that there is no maximum applicable to other categories of disability, like Mr. Roberts's disability. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Oh, yes.   Oh.   I feel slightly like an Abbott and Costello movie, but I am getting-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, so what happens to your argument if we disagree with you that employers have a way to seek a compensation order?   As I read the regulations, the only way they can do that is if the employee files a claim, and the employee's filing of the claim then sets the process in motion.   I can't imagine that any employee, knowing that a future award could help them, would bother filing a claim to help the employer lock in his rate. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " I think -- actually my experience, my universal experience with this statute, is that that is not a realistic view of what claimant's behavior is.   The critical difference is an award -- the entry of an award does not merely confirm that the employer is making payments; it requires it to continue making those payments until-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's not my question.   Most of your argument is premised on the -- I thought, that the employer could lock in his rate-- "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --Yes.

Gillelan II", "text": " Oh, I think -- well -- I have trouble accepting that hypothetical situation, because-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " As I've studied it, I think that's the case.   Assume that fact to be true, that employers have no regulatory or statutory right to seek an award.   They can either stop paying and have the employee make a claim or not.   How -- what does this do to your argument, if that's accurate? "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " --Nothing.   It simply requires the employer to induce the claimant to file a claim if it wants that award. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " By stopping payment. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So that destroys the whole voluntary payment aspect. "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Well, they wouldn't -- indeed, they wouldn't have to stop payment.   They simply need to tell the claimant: If you don't file a claim, we are going to stop payments.

But that, look, there is a statute here that says compensation cannot exceed more than 200 percent of the annual or weekly wage, then in (3) it says how to calculate that particular number.   And then you guy over to (c) and (c) says that calculated number applies to those newly awarded compensation.   And you're saying \"newly awarded compensation\" means somebody got it through an award, not somebody got it automatically.   And since somebody got it -- had to get it through an award or it wouldn't apply when you just get it because they pay for it, it just doesn't apply.   You have to go get the award, and the word you are turning on is \"newly awarded\". "}, {"speaker": "Joshua T. Gillelan II", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

But that does assume that \"newly awarded\" can't mean an entitlement.   And then you run up against some other statutory provisions where an award does seem to mean, not a formal compensation order, but instead an entitlement to funds.   So 908(d)(1), it seems as though the word 910(h)(1), it seems as though the word 933(b), which says \"award in a compensation order\", suggests that awards can be made in a formal order or awards can be made differently because of an entitlement that is automatically paid.   So I guess there are three places that it seems to me your reading of the word, your limited reading of the phrase \"newly awarded\", runs into problems in those three ways, and I'm left then thinking we should do what makes sense.

Um, yes, 9 -- the section 8(d)(1) that they are referring to refers to an award to an employee -- the unpaid portion of an award to an employee who dies before that award has been paid out.   Their reading of \"award\" in that provision is contradicted by the subsequent paragraph of the same subsection, which says   \"an award may be made after the death of the injured employee. \"   It's 908(d)(3).   Now that is impossible on their reading of 8(d)(1).   No, what it means in 8(d)(1), as throughout the act, is an award.   And if none has been entered while the claimant is still alive, it is entered after his death.   And the survivors under that provision take the rest of it that had not been paid before the death.   Now, you have essentially the same analysis of those other provisions.   Yes, in those other provisions as well, it does mean a compensation order.

Threaten to controvert liability when that employer has no good faith basis for doing so.   All to get the employee to file a claim that the claim -- that the employee doesn't think is necessary, to get a compensation order which serves no other purpose than to trigger this maximum rate provision.

The statute is supposed to encourage amicable agreement between employers and employees to avoid administrative process and the gearing up of the administrative machinery wherever possible.

Breyer", "text": " But, about the business, was newly awarded the tax credit at the time they made the deduction. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --At the time they became qualified for what the statute required them to do to get the tax credit, yes.   And that is how it is used in 910 (h)(1), as Justice Kagan said.   It's how it's used in 908.   And section 933, specifically provides Petitioner's definition of award, a formal compensation order, but says it is only for purposes of this subsection. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But that's not the way it is used in 914. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " That's correct.   And that's why this is a case like Robinson v. Shell Oil, in which the word employer was used throughout Title VII in different ways.   And what the court said is you then have to look at the context of the individual provision in which the word appears that you are construing to determine how the word is being used in that particular provision.   And here the most fundamental reason why it is an untenable construction of this act to rely on the date of a compensation order to determine the applicable maximum rate is that then the act would be silent as to the maximum rate in the vast majority of instances in which compensation is paid, because as Mr. Palmore said, in the vast majority of instances no claim is filed.   And as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, when no claim is filed, no compensation order will ever be issued.   And that's not an accident.   That is a function of a very central feature of the act's design that Petitioner's interpretation is entirely at odds with.   The act is designed to enable compensation to be calculated precisely and as early as possible so the money can get into the employee's hands very quickly and with a minimum of instances in which the administrative machinery has to be invoked.   That's why the norm is no compensation order.   And so Petitioner's interpretation is counter to that in at least two respects.   It relies on the existence of a compensation order which in most instances won't and shouldn't issue, and would maximize, rather than minimize, the number of instances in which someone has to go and get an order to force compensation orders out of a system to make Petitioner's interpretation work even though everything is happening exactly as the Act says it should be.   The employer is voluntarily paying exactly the amount that the employee says is due, and there is no need to get the agency involved. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But how much of a practical problem is this?   I understand the amounts are here, but if it's five years, and apparently the employee was happy to wait five years to get an award.   Normally if you are an employee and you are disabled, and the employer says, well here's what we are going to give you, and it's based on the maximum of the latest we have.   You're not going to say: I'm going to wait; these wages are going to go up nationally, and I'm going to wait a year; maybe I'll wait for years because I think there's a trend on national average wages, and I'm going to cash in on that; I am going to be without money for the next four years and I am disabled but -- I mean, that doesn't sound to me to be a plausible situation. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " But if Your Honor thinks about the situation in which the employee is voluntarily receiving from the employer everything that the employee agrees is due.   Then the question is, in that circumstance where the employer is doing everything right, what can the employer do to force out of the system a compensation order that will lock in the maximum rate?   And Petitioner's solution to that problem evidences the problem with his position. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, no, I mean -- apparently -- I don't know what the employers do, but usually in a situation like this, the employers have good lawyers and they write at the end of the check, you know: This is in full satisfaction of any claims under the -- the whatever. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " But there is no compensation order until that employee files a claim.   And under Petitioner's interpretation, there would therefore be no knowable maximum rate.   And Petitioner's solution to that problem, on page 16 of his reply brief, is to say that the employer should threaten a bad faith cutoff of funds.   The employer should say: I will cut you off unless you file a claim.   That is bad for everyone.   It's bad for the employee who has access to payments delayed; it's bad for the employer who apparently is being told that it must controvert liability in bad faith because the employer doesn't in fact disagree that the employee is entitled to liability or face a 10 % penalty for cutting off the employee without a basis for controverting liability, and it's bad for the agency who suddenly has all these claims filed, all in a situation in which everything is working exactly as the Act intends.

It was a commerce clause case from, I think, 1989 in which Your Honor began the opinion by saying, to describe a setup, an Ohio statute awards tax benefits to, and then describes the category of energy producers who could take advantage of the tax benefit.   And I think those energy producers-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --That wasn't -- you, you gave another example. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " --Robinson v. Shell oil?

"}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " I think it's the employee who was receiving voluntary payments, and everything is proceeding the way the Act intended.   But, the employer, in order to know what its maximum rate will be, in order not to be surprised 5 years hence by a maximum rate that only then can be known, has to force a compensation order out of the system.   And the only way Petitioner says the employer can do that is by threatening a bad faith cutoff of funds.   Whether it happens frequently or infrequently, Mr. Chief Justice, I think an interpretation that relies on a mechanism that is so obviously counter to the way the statute is supposed to function is, by virtue of that, an extremely unlikely and unnatural interpretation of the statute.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Keisler, if I could just go back to this language.   If, according to Justice Scalia's old opinion, the statute awards compensation at the time of disability, essentially what you would be saying is that an employer who becomes disabled in a certain year is awarded compensation at that time.   Is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " That's right, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes.   But I didn't say in that opinion that the -- the employer in -- in that cases -- or whoever it was that was entitled within the statute -- was \"newly awarded\" it.   I agree the statute awards it, but when you say somebody is \"newly awarded\", you're talking about an event at that time.   And that's -- that's a different usage. "}, {"speaker": "Peter D. Keisler", "text": " I think the function of \"newly\" in this statute is something different, Justice Scalia.   And that relates to the questions that Your Honor and Justice Breyer were asking about the relationship between the \"currently receiving\" clause and the final clause.   I think the 19(f), which provides for a COLA, a cost of living increase every year for that narrow subset of the most disabled of employees.   They and they alone get that annual bump-up.   And so that \"currently receiving\" clause is written for that category to make sure that their bump-up isn't capped by a static maximum rate.   The other part of the clause, \"newly awarded compensation\", is about everybody else.   Now, I think the use of the word \"newly\" there is just to distinguish it from the \"currently receiving\" clause, which is escalating year by year.   And those newly awarded compensation, meaning at one point, fixed in time -- only when you are \"newly\" awarded compensation are you then going to have your maximum rate fixed.   And then -- and both Petitioner and we agree -- whatever it's fixed at, whatever year, that stays the same for the duration of your collection of compensation.
