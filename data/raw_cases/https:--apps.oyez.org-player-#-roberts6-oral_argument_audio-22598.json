Franklin", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Over the last 3 decades, the Court has made clear that Bivens remedies are disfavored and will only be authorized in narrow situations where there are no adequate alternative means for redressing a plaintiff's injuries and no other factor counsels hesitation.   Respondent has satisfied neither criteria.   He has not shown that he lacked a traditional tort remedy for the injuries of which he complains, and Petitioners' status as employees of a private contractor rather than the government at a minimum gives rise to factors counseling hesitation. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Can we go back to what you said initially, that is if there's no alternative remedy Bivens fills the gap.   Suppose we had a case just like Carlson, only the State law allows survivor actions.   In Carlson, I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether they could have been a State tort. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " Well, the rule-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Is that so? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " --The the rule -- the Carlson rule still applies, Your Honor, because that involved actual Federal government employees.   And since Carlson, Congress has preempted all tort claims against them.   So whether Indiana law now, which has been amended, but whether Indiana law provides a remedy or doesn't is immaterial, because Congress has preempted all tort claims against actual employees of the government.   But these -- this case involves -- the Petitioners are not employees of the government.   They are employees of a private contractor.   And under the Westfall Act, what Congress did was preempt all claims against actual government officials while preserving Bivens remedies.   But it did the opposite for employees of private contractors.   For them there are adequate alternative tort remedies.   And it's virtually undisputed in this case that there was such a remedy here.   And they are deliberately -- Congress expressly excluded them from the category of employees against whom it preserved Bivens remedies.   So yes, in the Carlson situation, there is still a Bivens claim because Congress has expressly preserved that.   But here we have a different congressional policy that we are, in effect, asking the Court to embrace here.   What Congress did in the Westfall Act is it said what in effect we are asking this Court to recognize and what we believe the Court has recognized in cases like Malesko, and that is, where there are adequate alternative tort -- excuse me, where there are no adequate-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Suppose, Mr. Franklin, that there weren't.   I mean, I think you have a good case about California law here.   But suppose we were in a State where the law was very different from what California's law appears to be, where there was no special duty recognized for jailors, and indeed where the basic negligence tort was unavailable to inmates because there was a finding of -- a holding of the State supreme court that there was no duty on the part of jailors to inmates.   What would happen then? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " --In that hypothetical instance -- and we do think it's hypothetical -- we think that would be a different case and the Court could in that circumstance say there were no adequate alternative remedies.

They immunize State government officials from claims, but those claims would be subject to 1983 actions.   Here we have a privately managed prison holding Federal prisoners.

I'd like to first say that the Court in Malesko adopted the principle that if there is an alternative remedy that's not a reason for piling on a Federal remedy; that's a reason not to.

Franklin", "text": " --Let me give you a practical difference that it does matter for individuals in my clients' situation.   If a State tort claim is brought, there is respondeat superior liability under a State court claim.   And in many, if not most cases, the plaintiff will choose, voluntarily choose to sue the corporation and leave the individual out of the case.   Now, the deterrent effect that Bivens is concerned with still exists because the case can be brought against the individual.   However, if there is a Bivens claim, that has to be brought against the individual; it cannot be brought under respondeat superior.   So if there is a Bivens claim, as a practical matter you are going to see more and more individuals being dragged through these cases without, by the way, the recognized qualified immunity defense-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --Mr. Franklin, do you have a theory about why these are brought as Bivens claims?   It seems mysterious to me.   If you bring it as a negligence claim, you get a lower standard of liability, negligence versus deliberate indifference.   You get vicarious liability.   So I have been trying to puzzle out, why aren't these brought as negligence claims rather than as Bivens claims? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " --I can't answer that question.   What I can say -- well, I can try to answer, but I can say that if the Court rules as we ask it to in this case, we think that there will not be Bivens claims, that people will bring them under the tort law.   It could be there are forms in some of these prisons that are given out that have section 1983 written on them, that Bivens is there.   It could be that prisoners are not quite aware that the Westfall Act doesn't cover private contractors.   But we would think if the Court rules as we suggest it should, that the -- that the prisoners who are relatively savvy, even on a pro se basis, about their rights would then understand that they have these rights and will exercise them and that the Bivens remedy would not have been to be employed willy-nilly as it was in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " To go back to what I asked before when I hypothesized a State that didn't have adequate remedies, and you said -- well, just to pin down what you said, if there were no adequate remedies there would be a Bivens action available? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " There might be, Your Honor.   There still is the factors counseling hesitation, which is the second step of the Bivens analysis.   And I wouldn't want to give up that there might be factors in those cases counseling hesitation.   But certainly our position is not that -- in a circumstance, if that arose, and again we think that's hypothetical because there is no indication either that it has arisen or that it will arise, but if it were to, our position wouldn't rule out the possibility of a Bivens claim in those circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " To get back to the question that Justice Ginsburg asked, is that consistent with Carlson?   Because the Court in Carlson didn't say that there is a Bivens action because in this particular State there isn't a viable State action, but it might be different in another State where there is a viable State claim.   It did it on basically a categorical ground. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " Well, as the case came to the Court in Carlson, it was undisputed that there was no adequate State law remedy, the lower courts had held.   So that was sort of the basic premise that the Court then went ahead and decided the case on.   Since Carlson, we've had cases, notably Malesko and also Wilkie, which have made clear that the adequacy of remedies, including State law remedies, is a factor in the Bivens analysis and is in fact the dispositive factor in Malesko, as in this case as well.   We don't think that there is really any serious dispute in this case that there were adequate alternative remedies.   Again, the deliberate indifference standard is much, much more hard -- much harder to meet than a traditional negligence standard.   California law is, further, more protective of prisoners.   As we understand the Respondents' position, the Court -- they would urge the Court, notwithstanding the availability of alternative remedies in this case and as far as we can tell in every foreseeable case, to create what they refer to as a categorical cause of action, one that would apply regardless of whether the remedies are adequate or not.   And in our view, that would turn the Bivens jurisprudence effectively on its head.   The Court has said Bivens is a narrow -- I think Justice Ginsburg at least paraphrased our argument as saying it's a gap-filling mechanism, which is what our argument is -- that would apply only in those circumstances when it's necessary.   Other than that, the Court has consistently deferred the matter to Congress.   And that's where we think it ought to lie in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Does a prisoner in a State that requires the filing of a certificate of merit in a medical malpractice case have an alternative -- a viable alternative State claim-- "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S.

That issue is not in this case.   The Eleventh Circuit in Alba expressly addressed that issue under that State's law, and said yes, that is adequate.   It's simply a procedural requirement that applies to all plaintiffs.   And I would add, by the way, that-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " How is a prisoner supposed to satisfy that requirement? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " --The same way any other plaintiff is supposed to.   What I was going to add is that when you are alleging an Eighth Amendment violation, you are talking about a claim that by its nature is very severe.   You are talking about deliberate indifference to serious medical needs that constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.   In those circumstances, we would suggest that it might even be easier to procure that kind of declaration, but -- that issue was decided in Alba, so that -- that was decided.   If it comes up in another case, it can be decided there.   We don't think that that would render the -- if it's -- if it's an adequate remedy for everyone else in that State and most States that have these things, then it's an adequate remedy for Bivens. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Did any of those courts address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going to get an affidavit? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " Well, Alba -- the Alba court is -- is the only court that I'm aware of on the circuit level that's considered it.   And I believe they did address that issue and simply said that it is -- puts them on an equal footing with other plaintiffs, and that that would be an adequate remedy. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I don't -- I don't understand your answer to Justice Kagan.   If -- if I heard you right, you were saying, well, they are going to be able to get a certificate because it's an Eighth Amendment violation and everything is very severe.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I think the question, Mr. Franklin, is really just a practical one-- "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --which is how a pro se person sitting in prison is supposed to have access to a doctor who will provide this certificate.   And, I mean, maybe there would be means, but I'm asking whether there would be. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " I would think there would, but I don't want to say -- I don't want to argue someone else's case on that.   I mean, I do think that that was an issue that was resolved, at least in the Eleventh Circuit in Alba.   It's not an issue that applies in this case because there is no such certificate here in California.   I do think it would be adequate.   I mean, Bush v. Lucas, which was a Federal remedies case, said there were what they called \"meaningful remedies\".   As long as there is a meaningful remedy, it's sufficient.   And if Congress wants to think that there is a problem, for example, if Congress thinks there is a problem with these certificates of merit in the case of privately run facilities, then it certainly can establish a cause of action as it did in section 1983.   But the Bivens doctrine is really a narrow, as we say, gap-filling doctrine.   And the Court has always used it very sparingly.   And the reason the Court has done that is because there is no authority for it in the language of any constitutional or statutory provision.   So the Court has always treaded very cautiously in this area.   And I wouldn't rule out in that circumstance that somebody could make that argument.   I -- I just don't think in this case there has been any real dispute that there's an adequate remedy.   There wasn't in Malesko and that was sufficient in that case.   And we think it is sufficient in this case as well for the Court to in effect stay its Bivens hand and turn the matter if necessary over to Congress. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Under the PLRA -- under the PLRA, a district judge has to perform a screening function for -- for these complaints, and is that -- is it going to be an impossible burden for district judges to ascertain the contours of state prison law, in that there apparently is not a lot of prisoner litigation under State law?   Most prisoners seem to choose 1983. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan S. Franklin", "text": " Well, in this case, the agistrate judge did it.   It wasn't an impossible burden m for him.   This was done on a prescreening; the Court ruled exactly as we are asking the Court to rule now.   The Court did -- the Court in Malesko did it.   It wasn't difficult.   If it is deemed that there is an issue there, there are various procedural mechanisms that could be employed.   There could be a dismissal without prejudice, a dismissal with repleading, certificate to a State court.   You could stay the Bivens action.   There's various things that district courts can do.   But in this case, it wasn't an issue.   It wasn't an issue in Malesko.   We don't think it's going to be an issue in others either.   If I may reserve the remainder of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Shah. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The last 3 decades of this Court's precedents make clear that judicial extension of the Bivens remedy is not the default presumption.   It is permissible only where there is no adequate alternative remedy and there are no other factors counseling hesitation.   Neither criterion is satisfied here.   Respondent is suing employees of a private prison corporation who, unlike their Federally employed counterparts, are subject to well-established theories of tort liability, but lack a recognized qualified immunity defense.   Under the circumstances present here, which I submit reflect the heartland of cases alleging Eighth Amendment violations for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, recognition of the Bivens remedy is neither necessary nor appropriate. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Shah, go back to what you said about lacking these private -- these employees of the private corporation you said lack qualified immunity.   But they do have -- courts have allowed them to have a good faith defense.   So in practice, how different is that, whether they have qualified immunity or whether they have a good faith defense? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " A couple of responses, Your Honor.   First, this Court has never recognized a good faith defense, so I wouldn't call it a recognized defense.   It is true that some lower courts have applied a good faith defense.   Reading those cases, it is not entirely clear exactly what the content of that good faith defense is.   What is clear is that it is something less than qualified immunity.   It appears in most of the cases that they are grafting on some sort of subjective element, subjective intent element, on top of what you must establish to get qualified immunity.   So whatever it is, it is something lesser than qualified immunity, and I think that in and of itself creates an asymmetry.   But I think the larger point is, is that these prisoners have alternative adequate remedies under State law because they are suing a private employee rather than a government employee.   The government employee is subject to the Westfall Act and therefore all civil actions other than Bivens are preempted.   So I think that's the fundamental difference.   I think it further counsels hesitation because of the lack of a recognized immunity defense, whether that's qualified immunity or good faith. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could you address the question posed earlier of what were to happen if there was a State law that gave absolute immunity to these private correctional officers and that was the case before us.   This particular State, it's undisputed, would not permit any kind of intentional or negligence suit against these officers. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Sure.   Your Honor, in that hypothetical -- and of course, there is no suggestion in this case that any State has such a rule -- but if a State were to adopt that such rule, I think that would be a case where there is no adequate alternative remedy, because in your -- in your hypothetical, there is absolute immunity.   There wouldn't be a way for the prisoner to redress -- seek redress for the gravamen of his injuries.   And I think in that case, we have a very different situation and a Bivens remedy may well be justified. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Interesting, because what you are proposing is a sort of State by State, circuit by circuit, presumably existence of a Bivens claim or not.   That -- that is really the outcome of your position. "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Well, yes, Your Honor, except the fact that there has been no suggestion that any State has such a draconian rule or has ever passed one.   We are simply arguing for a rule that would limit Bivens when there is no adequate State law remedy.   That is clearly the case here.   It's clearly going to be the case in the vast majority of Eighth Amendment prisoners.   What this Court should not do is craft a default rule allowing Bivens remedies against employees of private prison corporations just to account for the hypothetical possibility that there may be a case which may or may not ever arise in which an adequate alternative is not.   That turns Bivens jurisprudence on its head. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Then I guess the question is, yes, when you talk about an overlap of remedies, we have said that it doesn't need to be a matching one to one remedy, but you do need some degree of meaningful overlap, don't you? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " I would agree with that, Your Honor.   I think-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how -- define how much or how do we describe the adequacy of that order? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " --I think it would be difficult to come up with a precise formulation.   I think the formulation that we use in our brief is that as long as it redressed the gravamen of the prisoner's injuries.   So I think as long as it provides some meaningful relief for the injuries and in turn that would provide some deterrence to the individual employees' actions, I think as long as those two elements are present, I think we would think that there is an adequate alternative remedy.   Or, alternatively, if you wanted to use the words -- the word that this Court used in Bivens, you could approach it from the flip side and say there would not be an adequate alternative remedy where the State law is either inconsistent with or hostile to the corresponding constitutional interest.   We submit in this case there is no question that there are remedies available under California State law and as far as we know the State law of every other State in this country that would allow-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " The Bivens action is unusual in the first place, but it's also unusual to say that you don't have a Federal cause of action because of something a State gives you.   Do you have any other example of something like that, where the availability of Federal relief turns on the availability of alternative relief under State law? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " --Your Honor, it may not be an exact analog, but I think Federal due process cases often will look at someone's claims of deprivation of property, an unlawful deprivation of property in violation of process.   The Federal court may often look at whether the available State law procedures to provide redress for that claim before it would impose or find a violation of Federal due process.   So I think there are analogs where Federal courts do look at the availability of State law remedies and look at their adequacy before determining whether a Federal law remedy is necessary.   And this Court has done that.   And the Court did it in Malesko, I think is the best example in the Bivens context of where the Court looked at alternative State remedies and said that, hey look, the availability of these other remedies counsel against the imposition of the Bivens remedy. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What is the theory behind that, Mr. Shah?   I mean there is an obvious theory when Congress has provided an alternative remedial system, which is a separation of powers theory.   But what's the theory about looking to State law for these kinds of alternative remedies? "}, {"speaker": "Pratik A. Shah", "text": " Two responses, Your Honor.   While I agree the separation of powers problem is much more heightened when Congress acts, I think there is still a separation of powers issue even when Congress has not acted.   That is, the Court should be hesitant before -- before implying a judicial cause of action for damages under the Constitution, given that it's typically been Congress's province to do so.   But beyond that, the rationales -- there have been two rationales that have been given by this Court in its Bivens jurisprudence for implying such a remedy.   One is the need to provide some meaningful relief.   We submit when there is an alternative state remedy, that rational has been satisfied.   The other rationale this Court has offered is provide some deterrent to the actions of an individual employee or officer.   We also submit that when there is a State tort damages remedy available, that rationale too will be accomplished.   The three occasions in which this Court has recognized the Bivens remedy, Bivens itself, Davis and Carlson, those two factors were not present.   There was either no alternative remedy at all or at least, as in Carlson, no alternative remedy against the individual officer. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Certainly here there hasn't been any dispute that there would be -- any real serious dispute that there would be an adequate alternative remedy.

The Petitioner's chief argument is that privately-held Federal prisoners should not have an Eighth Amendment damages remedy because they have damages under State law.   This argument suffers from two flaws.   First, it misconceives this Court's Bivens jurisprudence; second, it misconceives the nature of State remedies available to prisoners.

We admit there is a chance, as we did in our brief, that it's possible the California Supreme Court could say, well, there has been an intermediate appellate court that has decided this.   We take on guidance that and believe these remedies would be covered.   But there is nothing here that could assure this Court that that's the way it will work out.   With regards to why Bivens are superior, Bivens are superior when there is no State cause of action.   So there will be some cases, as we concede, where a State cause of action is available.   The reason Mr. Pollard brings a Federal cause of action in this case is because it's not clear that State remedies are certainly available.

I think the suggestion in this -- the discussion that we have had so far is that we are asking the Court to reach out and create an extraordinary cause of action.   I simply don't think that's true.   This case is very similar, if not the same as, Carlson.   In Carlson, the Court said that a Federal prisoner has a cause of action against Federal actors for a Federal constitutional right.   That's what this case is.   And the only distinction the Petitioners can point to is the fact that they are privately employed Federal actors as opposed to publicly employed Federal actors.   The question becomes, is \"privately employed\" Federal actor a meaningful distinction from \"publicly employed\"?   We would -- if that distinction is meaningful, we would have expected to find some discussion of it in Malesko, but the Court there paid absolutely no attention to the private status.   The Court in Malesko said that Malesko, that case, was in every meaningful sense the same as FDIC v. Meyer.   FDIC v. Meyer was a suit against a public agency.   If the case is in every meaningful sense the same as Meyer, then it must have been what mattered to the Court in Malesko was that it was a suit against an entity, not public versus private.   So we think there is no evidence in this case that -- excuse me -- no -- nothing in the law that suggests that this Court cares and ever have cared the distinction between public and private remedies.

But I don't think it's fair to say that the Court addressed in Carlson how it would compare to individual remedies.   That issue actually came up in Bivens.   There was an individual remedy proposed that would be available under State law, and the alternative was a remedy under the Constitution itself.   So when the Court was faced with two alternative individual actions, the Court said that we prefer the constitutional cause of action.   And the reason in Bivens was we can't be certain really how State law works. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

I think -- I take Your Honor's point to be that there could be a similarity at one point.   And we agree that that could exist for a particular circumstance.   But we don't think this Court should take the enforcement of Federal rights in Federal prisons with regard to Federal actors and set up a scheme where that is handled through state law.   There is simply not a justification there.   Your Honor, I would like to address the Westfall Act.   They argue strenuously that Congress has already spoken in this case, and that's simply not the case.   In the FT -- put it this way.   The FTCA and the Westfall Act deal only with Federal employees, the liability of Federal government for actions of Federal employees.   Their argument is essentially that Congress attempted to deal with whether or not private contractors should be liable in these situations by amending a statute that has nothing to do with private contractors.   And that simply doesn't work.   It's not -- there is no suggestion here that Congress attempted to address this situation. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, what was the purpose of making the reference to private contractors in the Westfall Act? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Preis", "text": " Your Honor, the Court -- excuse me, Congress did not make a reference to private contractors in the Westfall Act.   They simply, Congress simply referred to employees of the United States.   And the reason the Court -- excuse me, Congress referred to employees of the United States was because the FTCA only applies, and has always only applied to contractors -- excuse me, of employees of the United States.   There would have been no reason to reach out because it would be totally beyond the specter of the FTCA itself.   I think, Your Honor, there is something else to note with regard to Congress.   At most, what we are dealing with here is congressional silence.   They suggest that Congress is fit to take care of this.   Nobody doubts that Congress is fit to step in and take care of this at some point in time.   But Cong -- this Court's practice with regards to Bivens has been when Congress steps in, to stand back.   But here we have congressional silence.   As this -- as the Court said in 2007, it's most recent Bivens case was, when you are dealing -- well, excuse me -- the Wilkie case did not involve any specific congressional action.   The Court viewed it essentially as congressional silence.   The majority of this Court at that time said our evaluation in that instance is to figure out -- excuse me -- whether the Federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common law tribunal.   The Court at that point saw itself as that point as a common law tribunal within the specific circumstance of whether or not a Bivens remedy should be available.   That's not to say the Court should adopt some sort of roving common law power.   It's simply to say where there's congressional silence and the case looks almost identical to Carlson, if not identical, that there is sufficient reason for this Court to find a Bivens cause of action here.   If there are no further questions, I urge this Court to affirm the holding of the Ninth Circuit. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.

We think that if that claim somehow stated a claim under the Eighth Amendment for deliberate indifference, that he would state a claim under negligence as well, and all of these claims essentially are that the prison failed to accommodate his injuries.

Franklin", "text": " I think the opinion could be as it was in Malesko, there is no Bivens action because there are alternative remedies.   We think that holding in Malesko would apply everywhere.   Everybody has -- every State has a negligence cause of action.   And I think one thing that crystallized the argument for me is the colloquy between Justice Scalia and -- and my friend, where I think there was an admission that what they are actually seeking is a blanket cause of action to account for any possible instance in which there is an inadequate remedy.   I think it goes even further.   I think they are asking for a blanket cause of action if somebody can hypothesize an interest -- and issue, and even further than that, even if we can't hypothesize it, maybe somewhere along the line something could happen.   We think that's a -- a flipping, a turning Bivens on its head.   Bivens is a narrow remedy that is only allowed If those circumstances arise they when it is necessary.   can be dealt with at that time.

But in these circumstances we would expect if the Court rules our way that there would be in fact resort to what are not only adequate, but superior State law remedies, and that Bivens would then be reserved for another day if something happened that might implicate it.

I think -- I think he alleged that there was.   We would agree with the other side that the domicile of a -- of a prisoner at least in the circuits is determined by where the prisoner had been before they were in prison, and I think this particular prisoner had been somewhere other than California.
