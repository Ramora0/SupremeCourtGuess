And the contrary holding of the three courts below should be reversed for three reasons. First, the text does not require a church to establish benefit plans for someone else's employees. Second, the government's consistent view, over three decades, has generated enormous reliance interest and warrants deference.   And third, affirmance would resurrect the precise problems that everyone understood the 1980 amendment would fix. I could start with the text.   And the main text at issue here is subparagraph C(i) of section 1002(33)   And if you -- the government's brief actually has all the relevant provisions, so I think that's the easiest, if you want to look at their appendix.   And C(i) is -- is reprinted on -- on pages 11A. So again, we're looking at paragraph -- subparagraph C(i) of paragraph (33), which everyone in this case agrees expands the original church plan definition in subparagraph A. Now, the only plausible reason that C(i) repeats the entire phrase \"a plan established and maintained by a church\" is Congress intended that C(i) redefine and modify that entire phrase.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, still, Ms. Blatt, there is a -- you know, there would be a simple way of accomplishing what you think this provision accomplishes.   You know, something along the lines of just saying any plan maintained by a church-affiliated organization is a church plan or something like that. It's -- it's very odd language, this statutory language, and I'm wondering why you think that Congress chose to do what you think it chose to do in this perplexing way rather than in a straightforward way? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Sure.   I don't -- I don't find it that -- that perplexing.   When your -- your version would have messed up -- when you tried to -- tried to put it all in 33(A), it would have -- by saying just a church plan, it would have redefined all of (A), which had a second compound definition it -- of it had to be a tax exempt under Section 501. But, Justice Kagan, let me cut to the chase here.   If I had started from scratch, I don't know if I could have done this better.   I doubt it, because it's so complicated.   But let's look at what actually happened in 1974 and how -- just how different (C) itself looks.   Because, remember, they started in 1974, and there was an (A) and there was a subparagraph C. And now we still have subparagraph C.   So they were working with an existing apparatus. Now, old subparagraph C, itself, expressly required the church to establish C plans.   And these C plans had to include the church's own actual employees. And Congress did two huge things in paragraph C now.   It eliminated not only the express church establishment requirement, but the very reason for that requirement in the first place; namely, that these plans include the church's own employees. So what we have now today, and I don't think this is disputed, we know -- the one thing we do know is that (C)(i) plans can be maintained wholly and completely and absolutely outside the church and can include solely, completely, and wholly outside the church all the employees of any tax-exempt, religiously affiliated employer. So it just defies both common sense and our background understanding under ERISA to require the church to establish someone else's benefit plans when we know employers are usually the ones who set the employment benefits for their own employees. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It's not the problem with your reading.   This (C)(i) seems to be predominantly about principal-purpose organizations.   And I think the Respondent suggests that you would like it to read -- as reproduced on page 27 of their brief, you would like it to say includes a plan maintained by an organization controlled by or associated with a church.   But this provision seems to be giving authority to principal-purpose organizations and not to entities controlled by or associated. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Right.   Well, you're absolutely right except for the point about how I would like it to read, because we like the way it reads now.   What this does is it -- and there's no question that our reading gives independent meaning to principal-purposes organization.   We concede that an absolute full requirement is that the plan must be maintained by an organization, whether external or internal, that has its principal purpose the administration or funding of a plan. But, Justice Ginsburg, the definition of a principal-purpose organization includes a plan for any employee of a church.   An employee of a church is defined expressly in (C)(ii) to mean any employee not of a church; namely, any church-affiliated, tax-exempt organization.   So whether it's a pension board that's either sitting in the hospital or religious charity or it's a pension board that's externally incorporated, Congress made sure that the maintaining organization, the one with control over the funds and the administration itself, has to be religiously affiliated. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, this is a tricky question, but is this the question that was decided by the courts of appeals and is it the question that we agreed to review? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " No.   No.   So on remand, they have an argument that, assuming we win, and that there's no formal requirement that the church establish the plan, that the maintaining organization in this case, these retirement committees, don't qualify. But I do think it's -- it's quite important to understand that, Justice Ginsburg, when Congress was drafting this maintaining by a PPO, or principal-purpose organization, it was merely defining exactly what before and after 1980 and, regardless of the church plan context, what every employment pension plan in America looks like.   They're being maintained by either a separate retirement committee or a separately incorporated retirement committee. Now, the other -- what I think, Justice Alito, they were trying to say, it's anomalous that a plan could be established by the hospital, but it has to be run by a -- you know, an internal committee that's either controlled or affiliated with a church.   But the anomalies are exponentially, you know, monstrous on the other side.   Justice Ginsburg, in their view, Congress entrusted a pension board to have control over all the administration and the funding, but didn't allow it to establish the plan, which is absurd given the historical context that pension boards were both establishing and maintaining. The other thing that's anomalous about their -- their proposal is it leaves out in the cold the nuns and it assumes that Congress rebuffed every religious denomination in America who complained to Congress about how the IRS had been interpreting this provision.   And so what the IRS had done in 1977 is it looked at a -- it was attempting to define what constitutes a church.   And the IRS ruled that because nuns were not -- two orders of Catholic nuns were not the church when they were caring for the sick, their hospital plan could not be covered. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Ms. Blatt, I -- putting aside that purpose, do you think Congress had in mind a -- corporations that are essentially like every other corporation except they're not for profit?

But the place where Congress dealt with your concern about the institution that's not religious enough was not with establishment, but (C)(iv) requires any church plan that's -- that's being maintained by these affiliated organizations to have common bonds and -- common religious bonds and convictions. Now, Dignity itself has that in spades.   It has six orders, not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, six orders of women religious running its mission integrity committee -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm not going to fight over -- "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S.

They're not doing anything different than any other hospital. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S.

They have 60,000 employees.   Do you believe that Congress's vision was to let, what is essentially, a corporate entity opt out of protecting all of those employees? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " I mean, the Roman Catholic church is itself, I assume, some sort of corporate entity.   But let me get to the bottom line here. If you read Paul Clement's brief filed by the Catholic church itself and the brief filed by the United Church of Christ and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and the Seventh-Day Adventists, that's four churches, your decision applies to big and small, medium, extra-religious, nonreligious.   So whatever you think of Dignity -- and I have no doubt that it's -- it's both -- it has both Catholic bonds and Catholic affiliations.   But there's nothing about the size of this.   We know Congress had in mind a hospital plan. The word \"hospital\" appears on every page of the legislative history. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

You -- you described their opinions as thinly reasoned.   But that DCM that started it all from the IRS is certainly thinly reasoned. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " So let me go back to what our argument is under the IRS.   They prompted the amendment by trying to say what a church was.   Congress responded not by telling the IRS what the church was or that the nuns for the church, but by making that question irrelevant.   The IRS objected and immediately after the law was passed, started reverse course on the very non-plan at issue here. But let me get to the reason about Skidmore what this case is about.   In just two of these cases, Mr. Chief Justice, the Respondents seek 11 billion; I am not kidding, 11 billion per year.   That's $66 billion in two cases if ERISA's six-year statute of limitations applies.   The risk that the other side could recover, even any fraction of that amount, is reason enough for you to make sure that the IRS's decision is somehow unreasonable, that would jettison 30 years of settled expectations.

But I -- I think the significance is -- it's not just even the retroactive penalties.   Countless plans have been structured around the IRS, the Department of Labor, and the PBGC's view, and if you affirm, just for all the existing plans that were not established, you're unleashing a torrent of undesirable and unintended consequences, not just for the -- the -- the hospital -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

So it was the IRS's ruling under -- for the 1977 Catholic nun plan, and 20 -- I think 20 letters and the Church Alliance representing over 27 denominations, 50 million people, complained bitterly to Congress.   The entire -- I know you don't want to look at legislative history, but every single thing is about how hospitals and church agencies are part of and essential to the church.   And the only way, Justice Kennedy, to interpret that is that they were talking about the IRS's definition that because nuns were not performing priestly functions, they weren't the church.   And I just think -- so the IRS was at the table.   The IRS is objecting.   The IRS goes home and starts immediately reversing course.   And you have the fact that the -- I mean, we've talked about the IRS. The other side concedes that another major purpose was to put congregational religions on parity with hierarchical congregations.   And we know that the 1974 Act excluded these pension board-established and maintained plans.   And under Repondents' interpretations, these plans too were left out in the cold. We know that since the 1900s, these Protestant pension boards were not only maintaining plans they established, but plans that their church agencies had established. If I could reserve the rest of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr Stewart. "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to first to pick up on a point that Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the history of the statute and its amendment.   I think the statute in its current form is probably not the type of provision that Congress would draft if it were doing the whole thing in one fell swoop.   But it's important to understand that the text of the -- the current provision is the combination of things that were done in 1974 and things that were done in 1980. Congress enacted the original church plan provision.   Presumably, it had in mind particular plans that were established and maintained by churches and it covered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to light.   Other types of plans were found not to be covered by the administrative agency that Congress evidently believed should be covered.   And so when Congress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work within the existing framework.   We're not quite sure why, but at least one plausible explanation would be there were some church plans that had been found to be covered under the old \"established and maintained by a church\" language.   Congress may have wanted to avoid any possible inference that those plans were no longer covered, and so it retained the original language, but defined it to include something else. And when Congress passed the -- the provision that Ms. Blatt was discussing earlier, (C)(i), that refers to a plan established and maintained for its employees includes a plan maintained by a principal purpose organization, I -- I think it's -- it's helpful to recognize that there are two different sorts of definitional provisions that Congress sometimes enacts. Sometimes when Congress enacts a definition, it's trying to clarify what the defined term really means.   And when Congress acts in that way, we tend to strain to read the definition in a way that makes it consistent with ordinary understandings of a defined term.   But sometimes Congress will enact a provision that says something like the -- for purposes of this statute, the term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.   When Congress does that, it's not trying to explain what State really means; it's simply using a shorthand formulation to say, for purposes of this statute, we want D.C. and Puerto Rico to be treated the same way that the 50 States would be treated.   And that's really what Congress was doing in the 1980 amendment. When it defined the term \"plan established and maintained by a church\" to include plans that satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it was not saying this is what a plan established and maintained by a church really is.   It was saying, for purposes of the exempt -- of the church plan exemption, we want these to be treated the same. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Stewart, can I ask you about some of the Respondents' hypotheticals where they offer hypothetical statutes that are very similar in structure to this one? And it's pretty clear that you would read, you know, the one about disabled veterans and the one about the two presidential criteria, and it's pretty clear that you would read those sentences their way rather than your way; in other words, as just going to one of the criteria.   And I'm wondering why you think that's true, that they can come up with these hypotheticals that so clearly should be interpreted their way rather than your way. "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I guess I would say about the -- the hypothetical that is used most often -- most often, person disabled and a veteran includes a member of the National Guard.   I think if you read it absolutely literally, you would still say a National Guard member who is not disabled is covered.   Now, I think the -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, that would seem ridiculous, right? "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I think the instinct -- the -- the context would be such that courts would assume, I believe, that Congress had simply made a -- a sort of scrivener's error, that Congress had used language sloppily. Part -- part of that has to do with the instinct that I -- I alluded to earlier.   That is, we would tend to regard a provision like that as one in which Congress was really trying to explain what the term \"person who is disabled and a veteran\" means, and so we would strain to read the definition in a way that made it consistent.   If Congress passed a statute that said something like: Person who is disabled and a veteran shall include any Federal employee with 30 years or more of service, at -- at that point, we would understand Congress has just abandoned the effort to explain what person who is disabled and a veteran actually means.   It has decided for whatever reason that it wants employees with -- Federal employees with unusually long service to get the same benefits as a disabled veteran would get under a particular statute and has used shorthand to -- to accomplish that. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " See, I -- I would think that the way that hypothetical works, it's sort of -- we're setting these two criteria, you have to be a veteran and you have to be disabled, and then we're going to say there's a special case of veterans.   We also mean to include National Guard folks, and that's not disqualifying, the fact that it's a National Guard folks.   But the two criteria are still the two criteria. All we're suggesting is that it's not disqualifying that you are a National Guard.   And you could read this language similarly.   It's not disqualifying that it's maintained by a different kind of organization. "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I guess I -- all I would concede based on these hypotheticals is that sometimes a provision that is structured in this way will give rise to the natural inference that Congress wanted to do something other than simply deem a particular thing to fall within the whole defined term and that it had in mind a part. But I think, in construing this provision, it may be helpful to look at page 24 of the government's brief which explains -- which kind of clarifies something that Ms. Blatt was referring to earlier, that -- that on page 24 of the -- the government's brief, we lay out the way in which this amendment changed from the time it was first introduced in 1979 to when it was enacted in 1980. And as the questioning in the first part of your argument explained, the original introduced provision said a plan established and maintained by a church shall include a plan established and maintained by a principal-purpose organization.   And so the -- the words \"established and\" appeared two places in that introduced provision.   And as -- we agree with Ms. Blatt that the most likely explanation for what -- why Congress took out the -- the second \"established and\" was that it was worried about plans that would fall between two stools, a plan that was established by a church, but maintained by a principal-purpose organization.   That the -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " The -- the -- the hypothetical would be like this case, or this case would be like the hypothetical.   If the requirement that the plan be established by the church was absolutely critical, as the requirement that the -- the individual have a disability is absolutely critical in the hypothetical, which gets to the question: What is the significance, in practical terms, of a plan's being established by a church? Now, Mr. Feldman says that an entity that establishes a plan is financially responsible for paying benefits under the plan if the plan is unable to do that with its assets.   But you say that's not correct; is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " That's not correct.   I mean, in -- in the typical ERISA case, you will have a plan established and maintained by a single employer, and that employer will be responsible for making good on the promises, and -- and that employer may be a defendant in a suit if the promises are breached.   But that doesn't mean that the entity that established as the plan qua \"establisher\" is always going to be on the hook. It -- it in -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Sometimes on the hook? "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " Sometimes on the hook, if the establisher maintains ongoing responsibility.   But there's -- first, there's no reason to think, even if you applied ERISA standards, that a church that established the plan, but then left the administration of the plan entirely in the hands of somebody else, could be held liable under ERISA. Second, the whole point of the church plan exemption is that plans that qualify will not be regulated under ERISA at all.   They will be regulated under State law.   So if a church, in order to satisfy this requirement, established the plan and then left its maintenance to somebody else, whether the church would have any ongoing liability would depend on State laws that might vary around the country.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Can you -- can you tell me what provision of ERISA -- and I'll ask Mr. Feldman the same thing if I have the chance -- what provision of ERISA explains which entity, if any, is responsible for paying benefits if, for example, a defined benefit plan is unable to do that with the assets in the plan? "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I -- I don't believe there is a provision of ERISA that spells that out.   My understanding -- and I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't have the statutory cite -- is that there is a provision of ERISA that authorizes the plan beneficiaries to sue, but it doesn't specify who the defendant should be.   And so the courts have devised tests and approaches to determine in particular cases who the proper defendant is.   And to some extent, that will depend upon the way the plan itself is constructed; that is, the plan may say that the responsibility for doing certain things is that of the employer, for doing other things, it may be that of the insurer.   And so the proper defendant may determine on where responsibility is allocated under the terms of the plan. And -- but so I agree that one big difference between this case and the hypotheticals is the -- the hypothetical is constructed in a way that suggests disability has to be crucial to entitlement to benefits, whereas here, there's no reason to think that Congress, in 1980, regarded church establishment as crucial to the exemption.

If you accept their view, what you end up with is a statute that doesn't fit what Congress enacted at all and creates anomalies that are impossible to explain.

And Congress actually defined church plans carefully.   They wanted a close tie between the church and the plan because their purpose was they didn't want to go involved in -- get involved in church affairs. And so they said church plan has to be established and -- established and maintained by a church.   It needs to fit both criteria because we want -- if there's church involvement here, we want hands off.   If there's no church involvement, though, there's no reason why these hospitals, like any other hospital in the country, and like many other -- every other firm in the country shouldn't have to provide the employees with the pension insurance to protect them against the possibility that when the plan goes bust, they end up with nothing -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, isn't there -- didn't Congress provide for church involvement by making the employees covered by the principal-purpose entity church employees? "}, {"speaker": "James A. Feldman", "text": " No, it's actually -- well, just -- no, it didn't, actually.   The -- the -- that statute actually doesn't say anything about the principal-purpose entity. So there's three different kinds of things we are talking about here.   There are churches themselves, there's principal-purpose organizations, which are organizations that are in -- in the business of just giving -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And the church -- it -- it -- what it said was, yes, it's -- it's -- was facing a problem in 1980, which was the original statute said if you're a church, you can cover not only your own employees, but you can also cover the employees of your church agencies.   That's what the original statute said, but only until 1982.   And that is what everybody was objecting to, and that's why people was -- people were objecting to the withdrawal of that sunset provision that was going to happen in 1982. And the reason why they were talking about agencies are very closely related to churches, that was not a -- it was not to say -- their view is Congress wanted to allow fishing.   They wanted these agencies to split up -- these plans to split apart, and the agency to have their own plan and the church to have their own plan, and that's what they wanted.   But it's exactly the opposite.   They wanted to allow churches to continue, as they had been, to provide -- to have a plan that would cover both the churches' employees and the agencies' employees.   And they -- they were interested in continued fusion.   They weren't interested in fishing. And actually, there's nobody anywhere who talked about this statute who said, well, what we really need is to allow another whole class of private entities to establish their own plans. So in the provision that Your Honor referred to, where they -- they say, well, the employees of the church-associated agency will be deemed to be employees of the churches, Congress passed that provision to solve exactly the 1982 problem.   Okay? The -- a church plan has to be established and maintained by a church -- this is in (A), which was left unchanged -- established and maintained by a church for its employees.   And then in the original statute they said: Well, we don't really care whose employees they are, but you also can cover the church agency -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Okay? They don't define \"felony,\" they just say a felony includes something or other.   That's one kind of statute.   And then courts are supposed to figure out what else a felony includes. But this statute doesn't do that.   And in fact, the language at the beginning of (C)(i), a plan established and maintained by a church, ties it to -- this -- you actually can't read (C)(i) as a standalone statute, because it wouldn't make any sense. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I'm talking about -- "}, {"speaker": "James A. Feldman", "text": " It ties it to a -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

The Court -- if the Court has said one thing more often than anything else in the context of statutory interpretation, it's that you have to read things in context and you have to read statutes as a whole.   And this (C)(i) has language that ties it directly back to A, which Congress said in 1980, we are retaining A the way it is.   And I think you have to read them both together. If you read them both together, what you say -- the basic form is whether it's the example of the disabled veterans, the present or the examples that they give in the reply brief, the basic form of this is if you have a statute that says here's a rule that applies to A and B, and then it says A and B includes a particular kind of B -- which is what this says, right? -- established and maintained includes a particular kind of maintenance, then that is naturally taken to mean, well, we're -- we're -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, why would you -- "}, {"speaker": "James A.

We want to include a particular kind of B.   Now, that is one thing to notice -- it's not B -- it doesn't say -- I mean, and Petitioners have no answer for this at all, why Congress wanted to have -- require them to have a principal-purpose organization at all.   Churches don't have to have that.   And why did Congress trust them to establish their own plans and then say, but we actually -- you can establish your plans, Dignity Hospital, but you don't have to maintain the plan -- you can't maintain.   We are prohibiting you from maintaining your plan.   You have to go to a principal -- an agency that's principally involved in dealing with employee benefits that otherwise satisfies the requirements, and you have to have them maintain it.

But we actually go over each of the ones in our brief, and these are the ones that they cite, and they're actually -- Congress had no -- that was not the way they operated then.   It's actually not the way they operate now. The way they operate is, these are for congregational churches primarily, and in a congregational type of set up, you have an assembly or synod of the church itself, and this is just an assembly of all the local churches and they -- they will establish the plans.

If you don't make that commitment, if you say the church said we want somebody else to have a plan and lay out what the terms would be, actually the church would definitely not have established the plan.   It would be somebody else who if they took them up on it would. But for the church to establish a plan, and this case is actually -- the Dignity case is a perfect example.   The district court here -- and it's usually not a difficult inquiry.   The district court here found, and if you look around page 56A of the cert petition appendix, in the Dignity case, the district court said well, who established this plan, well, Dignity, the hospital, they passed a corporate resolution and they adopted a summary -- the appropriate corporate officers adopted a summary plan description, and they established the plan and that committed Dignity to doing certain things, and it wasn't somebody else who did it.   And that's usually what that inquiry is.   You need some kind of commitment. Now, Congress -- Congress, when that kind of commitment was made by a church, Congress said we want hands off, and they had good reasons for doing it.   It's very much like in the tax code, there's numerous other places where you have to distinguish between churches and church agencies. In Section 26 U.S.C. 7611, gives churches quite extraordinary protection against audits, against the circumstances under which they can be audited, the types of things that can be looked at and the rights they have during the audit.

Of those, six of them used the term \"Internal Revenue Service.\" But the Internal Revenue Service, at that time, was promulgating regulations. This is not about the Little Sisters of the Poor.   None of them mentioned that.   In fact, there's no mention of the Little Sisters -- or the sisters who had the plan in New Jersey.   There's no mention of that at all. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Feldman, why do you think -- I mean, I've -- I have read all your arguments about why the IRS letters are not entitled to deference. But I come at it from a different point, which is it was in part these private organizations, religious organizations, but the IRS, too, who was lobbying Congress to express itself on this issue and take care of what the IRS knew was a problem for all these people. And then all of a sudden, almost immediately after the legislation is passed, the IRS is believing and stating that it's done more than you claim. Isn't that, in itself, evidence -- not the Skidmore deference -- but evidence that the agency believed that the answer was different than you're promoting right now? "}, {"speaker": "James A. Feldman", "text": " I -- I -- you know, the agency did believe the answer was different, that that is in the letters.   There is no reasoning, actually, in those letters at all.

Feldman", "text": " And they were -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Rightly or wrongly, they assumed that this language fixed it and fixed it how they were describing it in these letters. "}, {"speaker": "James A. Feldman", "text": " They -- they did interpret it the way they did.   I wouldn't deny that they did that. But they -- they give no reason for doing that.   These were ex parte letters.   Every one of them, up until the last couple of years, was done on an ex parte basis. The competitors had no chance to say this is what we think.   The employees had no chance to say this is what we think.   They didn't analyze the importance of ERISA provisions.   They didn't analyze what would -- inevitably did happen, which is there are six or seven church plans already that have failed and left the employees with nothing; but had they been covered by ERISA, they would have had PBGC insurance.   The IRS didn't take any of that into account at all.   And to -- you know, they were just wrong in 1982. And in fact, it's hard to -- it's clear in one part that they're wrong that we talk about in the brief.   But it's hard to see what other reasoning they have about why they didn't take -- they didn't consider the practical consequences of this, they didn't consider the history of it, they didn't consider the -- the relationships between the A and the C(i) provision. They just didn't consider what any of the particular words of the statute meant.   They really didn't do any of that. I would like to make one other point on -- on reliance, which is, you know, this is about bringing these plans into compliance with ERISA.   That shouldn't be a hard thing to do, and a district court should be able to do it, giving them whatever period of time is reasonable.   That's the overwhelming thing that's at issue here.   And in fact, if, as they say, they haven't departed from ERISA that much, which we don't agree or believe, then it should be particularly easy to bring them into compliance with ERISA. The only two things that are backward-looking at all are the civil damages, which I mentioned, and the fact that you may have to adjust some vesting schedules between three and five years, which is likely to be a minor problem.

The one thing that's pellucid about C is that the church does not have to fund C(i) plans because the statute explicitly allows the maintaining organization to fund it.   And C(i) moves maintenance outside the church, which means the church are absolutely off the hook. They also -- you know, they -- they raise the dignity plan.   The sponsoring congregations did establish those plans, and the other side argues the sponsoring congregations are not the church.   And I guess that's because they're not priests. The other thing I would ask you to read is the brief by the United Church of Christ and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America.   They explain that the centralization that an establishment requirement would impose is anathema to their religious beliefs.   And it's the same reason that the maintenance is.   It's the continuum, establishment and maintenance. Establishment turns on day one.   And then day two, throughout time immemorial, there being -- the other side concedes you can maintain them.   But the notion that there is some umbrella church for -- for the Jews and the Protestants is just -- it's fantastical that could possibly establish these plans. The other thing I wanted to mention, the other side keeps talking about these closely-tied joint plans.   But the only other thing we know that is pellucid about C is that an exempt plan can cover every single employee in this country for a religious non-profit institution and not a single church employee needs to be in that plan. The other side is asking you to engage in a counterintuitive kind of weird thing that a church would set the dental plans and vesting requirements for employees of an affiliated organization, especially in a place like the Jewish and Protestant religions.   And that -- that just is not credible. And finally, on the anomalies.   I mean, they have the anomalies that the pension board would want to divorce the establishment from the maintenance.   They have the anomaly that -- that the nuns are left out in the cold.   They have the anomaly of the YMCA -- and I see my time is up.   I don't want to -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Do finish your sentence. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Oh.   That the YMCA is the only, you know, religious organization in America that got this exemption, and they have this sort of silliness that a church would establish plans for someone else's employees.
