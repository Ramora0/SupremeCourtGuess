[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 20-366, Trump versus New York. General Wall. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case should be over.   The district court held that appellees would be injured because illegal aliens would be chilled from participating in the enumeration.   But that counting is now over, and whatever chill ever existed has fallen. Appellees therefore pivot to possible future injuries, but as of this very morning, career experts at the Census Bureau confirmed with me that they still don't know even roughly how many illegal aliens it'll be able to identify, let alone how their number and geographic concentration might affect apportionment.   And if they don't know, certainly, the other parties to this case do not. The Court, therefore, should follow the course charted by the three-judge D.C. district court last week: Vacate the judgment below, allow the Secretary to comply with the memorandum, and allow any effect on apportionment to be litigated as it normally would be in a post-apportionment lawsuit by parties with concrete injuries. On the merits, there's no procedural problem with the memorandum.   The President may direct the Secretary to send him two sets of numbers so that he may decide how to exercise whatever discretion he has. The real fight here is substantive, over how much discretion the President has. Text, history, and precedent are all clear about the general test whether one is an inhabitant. The question is how to apply that test to people who are present in the country illegally. Treating someone apprehended at the border on March 31 or scheduled to be removed on April 2 as a usual or settled resident of the United States on April 1 flies in the face of this Court's cases, common sense, and any sound theory of political representation. The President has at least some discretion to determine that at least some illegal aliens lack enduring ties to the states, which means that the judgment should be reversed. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " General, my first question goes to the very first point you raised.   We expedited this case in light of the December 31 deadline for the Secretary to transmit the census to the President. Is that date still operative? Do you still need a decision by that date? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Well, the situation is fairly fluid, Mr. Chief Justice.   We -- because of the two weeks that we lost to the California injunction and some subsequent issues in processing the data, we are not currently on pace to send the report to the President by the year-end statutory deadline. But just this morning, I confirmed with senior leadership at the Department of Commerce and the Census Bureau that we are hopeful, and it remains possible, that we can get at least some of the PM-related data to the President in January, so we do still need relief from the Court, yes. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sounds like you had a busy morning.   What -- what -- what do you mean, \"PM data\"? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " I'm sorry.   The Presidential Memorandum data.   So the data the President has requested in order to -- to potentially back out illegal aliens from -- from the apportionment base. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " On the standing question, if the Court doesn't intervene now before the Secretary transmits the information to the President, I don't know when the Court would be able to intervene.   All -- all that would be left after that transmittal is the transmittal by the President to -- to the House. So, if -- if the injury can't be redressed at this point, when could it be? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " In a post-apportionment lawsuit, just as in Franklin or Wisconsin or -- or Utah versus Evans, if the -- if the -- the Bureau is able to feasibly identify enough aliens and the President excludes those categories and that affects the apportionment -- those are all three unknowns -- but, if that happens, then you have a post-apportionment challenge just as in Franklin for the Secretary to revise his report and for the President to send a new report to the House, in effect, to redo the apportionment. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But isn't that going to be like having to unscramble the eggs? I mean, the apportionment, any -- any change in any one state, of course, is going to have ripple effects all across the country, and it does seem like it would be more manageable at an earlier stage. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't want to resist this too much because we would prefer for the Court to reach the merits and uphold the Presidential Memorandum.   We just think, for the reasons given by the D.C. district court last week, there are too many unknowns here. I do -- I take the point that there -- there is a bit of an omelet to unscramble, but we do unscramble that in post-apportionment lawsuits.   So it's possible to enter relief. And on the flip side, you could have the Court issuing an opinion on what the President may or may not do, only to discover days or weeks later that it's effectively advisory because the numbers aren't large enough to affect the apportionment and the appellees here and other potential appellees wouldn't be injured, either with respect to apportionment or funding. That strikes us as a fairly serious problem, either as a matter of Article III standing or prudential ripeness. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " General, just very quickly, should we assume that we're not going to be talking about all illegal aliens in the country but some subset, some uncertain subset, like the ones in ICE detention? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " I think it is -- I think it is very fair to say, Mr. Chief Justice, that the President has not made a determination yet, because we don't know what's feasible, about excluding all illegal aliens and has recognized that some subsets are going to be much stronger cases for the exercise of his discretion than other subsets.   And that's -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank -- thank you, General. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. General Wall, I -- I'd like you just to discuss a bit as you understand the -- what Respondent is arguing. How does their alleged injury would be redressable without including the or enjoining the President? Because it's actually his decision that it seems that they're ultimately concerned about. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Well, I think that's a fair point, Justice Thomas, but the Court crossed that bridge in Utah v. Evans over a dissent by Justice Scalia that the relief wasn't redressable because relief couldn't run against the President. And the Court held in Utah, and no one has asked here that that decision be overruled, that it was fair -- that you could obviously enjoin the Secretary as a subordinate official and that the judiciary would assume that the President would comply. And so too here there's no reason to believe that the President would not comply with this Court's judgment either now or in a post-apportionment context. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " The -- in Utah, is my understanding, that that was actually the census, wasn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Yes, it was a -- it was a challenge to certain procedures that were being used with respect to the -- the census. It was, in effect, a sampling claim. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Okay.   But, here, we're talking about something separate from the census, or am I -- am I mistaken? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " No, I -- I think that's the other side's argument, Justice Thomas.   I think they have -- they have seized on the fact that we've sometimes used the word \"census\" to refer to the counting and said, a-ha, look, the Census Bureau came up with a final number, and the President essentially accepted that but then sought to back out illegal aliens. And I don't think that's right.   The Presidential Memorandum makes clear that he was exercising his authority under Franklin to determine the apportionment base after the counting. And so I -- I don't think -- it is certainly our position that this is not somehow outside or stands apart from the census. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Could you actually, though, get the exact same information in a memo that's from the Commerce Department or the Census Bureau that says this is not the Section 141 report, but here's our what we think those numbers look like? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " The statutory scheme seems to contemplate that the President will rely on the Secretary's report in sending his submission to Congress. Now Franklin says he's entitled to reform the data that the Secretary gives him. But I think it would be a much more difficult question if he tried to act entirely outside of the process that the statute set up. And, obviously, here, he hasn't done that.   He's just exercised his authority under Franklin to tell the Secretary that he wants to look at different sets of numbers so that he can make a decision about the apportionment base. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, it just seems to me that, you know, the -- I don't understand why you couldn't get the exact -- the President couldn't get the exact same advice outside of the context of a formal report with -- with separate numbers and then make his decision. But, beyond that, the Chief Justice asked you about the subset, subcategories of -- or subsets of illegal aliens.   But could you give us your idea of what the President means generically by \"illegal alien\"? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " He means people who are present in this country unlawfully, and that -- that -- that includes a number of different subsets.   We've named several of them in our brief which I think are the clearest cases for the exercise of the President's discretion, but there are a number of other set -- subsets too. But the entire category is -- is people who are present in this country in violation of federal law. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, General Wall. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes, thank you. I was also concerned with what Justice Thomas brought up, and so, to clear away some weeds from my mind, would you tell me where I missed this or if I'm right. We're looking at a statute, 141.   A says the Secretary shall take a Decennial Census, okay? B says the tabulation of the population that he just took, as required for the apportionment of representatives, that tabulation shall be reported to the Secretary -- by the Secretary to the President. That's the report we're concerned about.   That's the tabulation we're concerned about.   And it is based on that, where you go to 2a, the President shall transmit a statement showing the whole number of persons for the purpose, again, of apportionment. So we're not interested in other ways. We're interested in this report, in this tabulation, under 141(b). Now, if I'm right so far, the President's order says I'll tell you why I want that.   I want that because it's our policy that illegal aliens will not be included in the census.   I can't tell you exactly what ones.   It doesn't say that.   It just says illegal aliens will not be included.   And he asked for the report so he can do that. Now, if the Constitution forbids him to, or if the statutes forbid him to, subtract from the tabulation for purposes of the statement, if it forbids him to subtract those illegal aliens, or to the extent it does, the tabulation and the report are not the tabulation required for the apportionment of the census and, therefore, he cannot ask -- he cannot ask the Secretary for that report to contain that information. Right or wrong and, if wrong, why? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " I think I agreed with you up to the very end, Justice Breyer.   I think you correctly understand how the statutory provisions, which were passed together in 1929, work. And I -- I think it's true that if the Constitution or the statutes constrain the President's ability to back them out, then that would mean that his statement -- setting aside judicial review, his statement to Congress under 2a(a) would be unlawful. But I don't know that any of that is a constraint on his ability to simply request the information from the Secretary. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, it is not the information if it's unlawful that is required for the apportionment of rep -- the House of Representatives because it is illegal. Now whether it's illegal or not is a different question.   All we have on that is about 40 briefs that show that the history, the language, the consequences, the purposes, and a bunch of other things argue against you, but you have arguments against that. But, if that side wins, then I don't see how the information he's requested could be the information required for the apportionment of representatives, quoting the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " I think all I would say, Justice Breyer, is I don't want to run together the procedural and the substantive issues.   I think what you're really getting at is the substantive issue of what the President's powers are here, not any of the procedural issues that they've raised with respect to the -- to the memorandum. So I -- I agree with you that what's really at issue here is that substantive question that you're focused on. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, maybe, but we're not suing the President.   They're not. They're suing the Secretary.   And they're saying: Mr. Secretary, you cannot give to the President this requested information and also say that that piece of paper that you send him is the tabulation as required for the apportionment of representatives.   It may be something else, but it isn't that.   And that's what he's asked you to do, and that's what you're trying to do.   And, Mr. Secretary, if it's illegal, you can't do it. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " That's right, Justice Breyer.   My only point was that doesn't have anything to do with their procedural arguments about the use of administrative records or whether this is somehow part of the census. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, it doesn't. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " That's all just their substantive claim -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " -- that the President doesn't have the power to ask for the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay, okay.   Then they don't -- on that one, it says \"persons,\" this started in 1820, you know, and they've always counted people who were here and not -- and not naturalized, and this has never happened before that you excluded illegal aliens, and it has a lot of negative effects on the states. You know all those arguments.   And they're fair -- I think they're fairly strong ones. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I mean, what do you -- what do you want to say? They're persons, aren't they? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Briefly, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " So just very briefly, Justice Breyer, there's two different things there.   One is the historical practice, which I hope I'll be able to address later because I think Franklin takes care of that.   The other is the text and the history.   None of that goes specifically to the question of illegal aliens. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " General Wall, if I can, I want to try to press you a little bit on some of the answers you gave to the Chief Justice because I find the posture of this case quite frustrating. It could be that we are dealing with a possibility that is quite important.   It could be that this is much ado about very little.   It depends on what the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce are able to do. If I just take the numbers from the district court in D.C.'s opinion last week, they said that the -- the plaintiffs in that case were claiming that there are 10.5 million people in this country who would be counted as being here illegally.   But, if you look at the smaller number of -- of those who are held in detention facilities, it's -- it's something like 60,000. The first number could easily change the apportionment of representatives.   The second one, it's much more doubtful that it would change the apportionment of representatives. There are only 31 days left in the year.   To exclude the 10.5 million seems to me a monumental task, to do that without sampling, to take 300 million plus names and determine individually for each of those people whether they are lawfully in the United States. And I would think you would be able to tell us whether that remains a realistic possibility at this point. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Can you not provide us with any more information than what you provided in your answer to the Chief Justice, was that, basically, they're working on it? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Well, I can provide you with a little bit more.   I don't know how satisfying it'll be, but I think it is very unlikely that the Bureau will be able to identify all or substantially all illegal aliens present in the country, so anything like the 10 or 11 or 12 million numbers that are flying around. They will be able, I think, to do ICE facilities, which, as you say, is some number in the tens of thousands.   The question is where it will fall in the middle.   And we don't know, and the reason we don't know is because it -- it -- it -- it turns a great deal on the level of detail that we got in doing the enumeration. And until we actually take the census master file and these various administrative records, once they're all cleaned up and ready to go, and we actually run the models in a few weeks or, you know, whenever it is, we won't actually know how many people we pick up. And so, you know, I pressed the deputy director of the Census Bureau on this very question, and the simple fact is that the experts don't know.   They don't know whether it'll be 50,000 or 100,000 or 500,000 or a million.   So there's just substantial uncertainty. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, before my time runs out, I -- I'm -- I have no expertise whatsoever in this area.   I could understand if they say all we can determine is how many people are in detention facilities or subject to final orders of removal. If they're going for the bigger picture and trying to identify everybody who is in this country unlawfully, I don't see how that -- they can provide a partial answer to that. If they were to say, well, you know, we've done this for 200 million people, but we don't know about the 100 million plus additional people, there's no way an apportionment could be based on that, is there? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " They're trying to get the categories of illegal aliens that you could identify based on the kinds of records we have, so final orders of removal, for instance, or people who have been removed who are found here again and haven't been given any lawful status. So it's not that we can pick up everyone.   There will be some undetected illegal aliens who -- who we aren't even attempting to screen for because they wouldn't be picked up, obviously, by any record. It's the categories that would be shown by some sort of record that we have.   And the question is just, how feasible is it going to be to capture large numbers within those categories? And, unfortunately, we don't know at this point. And it's a feature, by the way, though, I have to say, not of the government's conduct.   It's a feature of the fact that appellees brought a pre-apportionment challenge on the basis of this injury that was always going to cease in the past -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " -- before the judgment would take effect. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yes.   Mr. Wall, as I understand and read the memo, the President's memo, he says he intends to exclude every alien who does not have permission to be here in the United States. Now, yes, he limits this to where it's feasible to identify that, but right now his policy is, if I can identify them, no matter what the reason is for them being illegal -- an illegal alien, I'm going to exclude them from the census. Following up on Justice Alito's question, aren't those the very categories that you already say that we've been told there have been some of them who's in ICE is going to come by December 31, and then, by January 11, the Census Bureau says that it intends to provide the President with the information \"necessary to fully implement the Presidential Memorandum.\" I'm quoting the Census Bureau.   So, if I take that at its face, it means that the number's not going to be 60,000.   The number intended is substantially large.   And I think that was Justice Alito's point, which is the Census Bureau has been collecting data about undocumented immigrants from other agencies for over a year. I don't see how you can represent to us that you don't think it's going to be a substantial number. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Three quick points, Justice Sotomayor. First, that's -- I don't think that's actually an accurate statement of the memorandum.   You're certainly right that that's the policy, but there are two built-in limitations.   One is whether it's feasible, and the second is whether the President decides that he has the legal discretion to exclude all of these subsets.   And the subsets might have different legal analysis depending on the kind of ties they have or the type of status they -- they -- they have. But the second, the fact -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Wall, I -- I'm a little bit questioning of that for the following reason: The Census Bureau already defines what residency is, where you're living as a snapshot date of April 1, 2020. Now, whether you're in a prison, in ICE detention, we're told by one of our amici that 57 percent of the people in detention will eventually be released to the United States either through asylum or through some other mechanism. So I am not sure how you can identify any class of immigrant that isn't living here in its traditional sense, that this is where they are, this is where they were on April 1 and where they intend to stay if they can find any way to do it. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, based on my understanding from the Census Bureau, there is a real prospect that the numbers will not affect the apportionment.   But, as I said earlier to the Chief Justice, I'm perfectly happy if the Court disagrees with us on that and disagrees with the analysis of the D.C. district court last week and moves to the merits because we think, on the merits, the Court should uphold the Presidential Memorandum because at least some of the illegal aliens captured by the Presidential Memorandum don't satisfy the test for inhabitancy either as a matter of the Constitution or the statutes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, what you're saying is the memo says, I think anyone -- the Presidential memo says, I think anyone without papers should not be counted.   Now you're saying: Well, maybe the President will limit that sub-category. But that's not what he's asking for. He's asking for all of those illegal aliens that can be unidentified. And wouldn't Heller defeat this argument that we shouldn't rule? In Heller, we knew that there were certain people who states could legitimately bar from possessing guns in their homes, but we didn't say because there's that subset we're not going to declare what the general law is. So why shouldn't we do the same thing here, you can't exclude illegal aliens may -- because they're undocumented? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " The Court would have to conclude, in order to say that, as the district court here did, that the President doesn't have the discretion to exclude any illegal aliens from the apportionment base, even some subset, because the injunction here prohibits him from getting any of the information he needs to exclude any subset. And he did make clear in the memorandum that although, as a matter of policy, he wanted to exclude the entire set, that he had not yet made a judgment on whether he had the legal discretion to do that for the entire class.   He wanted to see what the people -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " -- in the Bureau -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " General Wall, I guess I'd like to keep going with the line of questioning that the Chief Justice and Justice Alito talked about as to what categories we're talking about. As I read you, you're saying, well, yes, there's this small category of ICE detainees, that seems pretty feasible, but that's just tens of thousands of people. So how about a few others? As I understand it, there are almost 200,000 persons who are subject to final orders of removal. Will the Bureau be able to report on those? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " It is working very hard to try to report on that subset, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   There are 700,000 DACA recipients.   Will the Bureau be able to report on those? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " It is working on that too.   We can't be certain at this point, and we don't know what the President will decide to do with respect to that set.   He hasn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   I mean, you -- I mean, obviously, you have papers, all kinds of records on those people, so I -- I would think that that sounds pretty feasible to me. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " But -- but the problem is the matching, Justice Kagan, right? We -- we have the administrative records.   What we don't know is the number that participated in the census, either through questionnaires or other proxies, and that provided sufficient detail to do the matching.   That's the problem here. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   How about the 3.2 million non-detained individuals in removal proceedings? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " It's the same thing. We have to have reliable information on them and that information has to match up with what they provided to the census.   So we -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   So what I'm -- what I'm getting from you is we can get very easily to 4 or 5 million people who you have extensive administrative records on, and you're saying, well, there's a matching problem. So I guess this goes back to Justice Alito's question.   You're 30 days out.   It seems to me you either know whether you can do matching or you don't know whether you can do matching.   Why the uncertainty on this? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Be -- because, until you actually compare the one set against the other set, you just don't know how many hits you'll get. But, again, Justice Kagan, I'd -- I'd love to move to the merits because, if the Court decides we're wrong and that this really is teed up constitutionally or prudentially, even though there may not be an effect on apportionment, I think that there are good reasons that we haven't yet talked about why the entire category of illegal aliens shouldn't be thought to qualify under the inhabitancy test. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Can I ask you, before we go to the merits, Mr. Wall, how would a post-apportionment challenge of the kind you talked about earlier work? It seems to me that the time period, once it's post-apportionment, is very crunched.   States have to do their own redistricting.   How exactly does that work? What's the time line on it? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Well, here, the time line's even easier than in a normal case because the district courts have already decided the merits.   So I think this is going to move even more quickly than this round of litigation, which obviously only took a few months. But you bring the -- you bring the case, you get the order to the Secretary to -- to fix the report, and then the executive branch would have the option of seeking review in this Court.   That could all play itself out fairly quickly, I think. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Fairly quickly.   Like, what -- what -- what do you think it would play itself out to? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Like, when would the end date be? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " I -- I -- it's -- I couldn't say, Justice Kagan, because it depends on when the report gets to the President, how quickly the district courts enter relief, and then the party that's, you know, aggrieved comes up to this Court, but I would think a matter of a few months. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Do you think that given that you're uncertain when the report will go to the President -- this goes back to the Chief Justice's first question -- that there's something to be said for not following the expedate -- expedited procedures that -- that you asked us to follow and just sort of keeping this around in a normal way and you could tell us whether expedition was necessary when you knew? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " I think the problem, Justice Kagan, is this is all fairly fast-moving, and if the Court doesn't enter some kind of relief, we would face a real prospect that the Secretary would never be able to send the report to the President, and the President then wouldn't be able to turn around and send a -- a report to Congress. So, no, there's a live -- you know, there's a live controversy between the parties in -- in that sense, which is we want to be able to have the President exercise his power, and the injunction currently blocks us from doing that.   It's just no longer founded on some injury to the appellees that is sufficient for standing or ripeness purposes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Thank you, General. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Gorsuch. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Good morning, Mr. Wall.   I'd -- I'd -- I'd like you, just to press a little bit further, on what are the -- what are the practical difficulties and -- and -- and likelihood of actually being able to do the matching process with respect to various categories? It -- it -- it seems like the one common ground is the 10,000 or whatever number it is currently in ICE detention is something you think will -- will happen. Beyond that, can you give us any sense of the difficulties or likelihoods? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " I can't, Justice Gorsuch.   I -- I -- I -- the Bureau is working very hard, but, as I say, until they actually do the comparison, we just won't know how many identifications we're able to make and whether that stands to affect the apportionment.

And so are we arguing over the meaning of a statute that doesn't exist? I had hoped to get some response from the government on that in its reply brief but didn't see any.   Perhaps I missed it. And what -- what is the government's view about the status of Section 2? New York suggests, well, maybe it is repealed, but to the extent the government wishes to comply with the repealed statute, it has to follow the repealed statute's terms, as one response.

It's never been litigated. I'm -- I'm not aware if we've even ever briefed it.

You -- you forcefully argue that there's too much uncertainty, that the dispute will become a concrete Article III controversy only after the President transmits the statement.   But I want to button up some things on that to make sure we're on the same page and follow up a bit on what Justice Kagan was asking you. First of all, you're not saying, as to judicial review, not now, not ever.   You're just saying not now as I understand it. But, as Justice Breyer indicated, the posture of this will change after the President transmits the statement, and there's a question about injunctive relief against the President. So I think you're saying that we can assume, as the Court has before, that the President would comply by a declaratory judgment requiring him to transmit calculations that include those non-citizens living -- living unlawfully within the country if we were to issue such an order after the President transmits the statement.   Is that accurate? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

Is that accurate, or what's your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " We're not sampling. This is what I was trying to say to Justice Kagan earlier.   We're taking the records from the -- the -- the administrative agencies and we're taking the data given by individuals with respect to the census and we're comparing them. We're literally trying to individually identify people who are present in the United States in violation of federal law.

Kavanaugh", "text": " And then, on the question of ripeness or standing, our -- our doctrine, as I see it, parts of the ripeness inquiry are really similar, if not identical, to parts of the standing inquiry if you look at the phrasing in cases like Ohio Forestry on ripeness and cases like Susan B. Anthony on standing. The key point, I think, is that the memorandum imposes no obligations on the plaintiffs to do anything at that -- at this point, unlike, for example, a typical agency regulation that might, say, impose some duties or requirements on the plaintiffs and we allow pre-enforcement challenges. We've called that lack of ripeness. We've called that no standing.   Do you think it matters which we call it, and do you agree that the two inquiries overlap on that particular kind of analysis? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Yes, there is substantial overlap.   We framed it as a constitutional matter because we don't think they satisfy the constitutional minima, but if you thought they got the toe over that line, then you'd get the same analysis, I think, as the -- as Judges Katsas and Friedrich did as a matter of prudential ripeness. So I -- I agree that there is a lot of overlap.   And, obviously, under Steel Co. and Senken, you can do prudential ripeness before the merits because it's -- it's a threshold doctrine.

You know, as Justice Breyer said, a lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position.   And, you know, there's evidence that in the founding era, an inhabitant was a dweller who lives or resides in a place. You do have this Vattel quote that defines an inhabitant as a -- distinguished from a citizen, as a stranger who's permitted to settle and stay in the country. Do you think that Vattel quote is your best evidence? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Well, if you look only at the founding, I think the Vattel quote is good.   I think Madison in Federalist 42, when he talks about a state allowing you to become an inhabitant, is fairly powerful. And what I'd say is, look, there isn't a lot of attention given to the specific question of illegal aliens for the first half of the country for obvious reasons, but the Court does have to deal with the residence or dwelling question in other statutes.   And the answer it consistently comes back with is, if you've entered illegally, you are not treated as if you're dwelling or residing here; you're treated as if you're stopped at the border. And the other side doesn't really have any answer to why those cases shouldn't equally apply here and say, look, if the test is usual or settled resident, you're not thought to be a resident, and even if you are, there's nothing usual or settled about your residence if your presence is violating federal law and the sovereign hasn't agreed to let you stay. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But, if -- if an undocumented person has been in the country for, say, 20 years, you know, even if illegally, as you say, why would some person not have a -- such a person not have a settled residence here? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " So take long-term embassy personnel, so somebody who's worked at an embassy for 15 or 20 years, Justice Barrett. That person certainly has ties to the community, and yet we have excluded them in some past censuses because they're not the sort of ties, just as with illegal aliens, that amount to residence or dwelling or what Franklin calls allegiance or an enduring tie. And so too federal personnel overseas. They're not residing here.   They may spend years at a time abroad, but we still think they have the kind of tie that counts here. And so I think -- I'm not disputing at all that illegal aliens form ties to the community in -- in the sense you're talking about.   But they're not the sort of ties that are sufficient to qualify you within the apportionment base because they don't count for residence or dwelling within the meaning of these federal statutes. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But you concede that illegal aliens have never been excluded as a category from the census? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Well, yes, we have taken account of alienage in certain ways before, but, yes, and that's the best argument on the other side.   There is a historical practice.   And if we didn't have Franklin, it could be tougher for us.   But we know from Franklin that the fact that you've got a fairly unbroken practice doesn't necessarily mean it's constitutionally compelled. They need some evidence that that has to be the rule as a constitutional or statutory matter, and that's what they don't have.   They have a bunch of historical evidence that they -- that the founders and the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment didn't want to limit it to citizens or voters, completely agreed with -- with all of that. But what they don't have is any evidence that they specifically wanted to include illegal aliens because they thought even if you came here in violation of the law, you were nevertheless an inhabitant.   That's the very question that in other contexts the Court has answered in the negative by saying you're not a resident. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So it's just been an unexercised discretion; all along they could have been excluded from the sentence -- census, and the fact they had not been excluded before doesn't mean the President can't make the choice to do so now? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " Well, so too in Franklin, Justice Barrett, but I guess I'd qualify it a little bit.   For the first half of the -- the nation's history, the question doesn't come up because you don't have federal immigration restrictions.   And for the second -- much of the second half, it doesn't matter nearly as much as it matters now. So, look, I'll certainly grant that no President has made this judgment before.   No President's ever focused on it before.   But I think, in order to say, as in Franklin, that the President can't do this, he can't include -- there, it was federal overseas personnel, even though they hadn't been included for, you know, a host of censuses, they need to point to something in the text or the history that clearly mandates that they be included in the apportionment base. And that's every illegal alien.   It's not the only -- only the ones you were talking about that have ties to the community.   It's somebody who's apprehended at the border and in an ICE detention facility, sometimes only for a day or two, before being sent back to Mexico or the northern triangle. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

So, just as I was saying earlier, we think that there are a handful of unknowns here: what will be feasible for the Bureau to do, whether the President will decide to exclude all of the subsets that are feasible -- the memorandum clearly indicates that the President hasn't made that legal judgment; it's made a policy call but not the legal judgment -- and the effect on apportionment. And as I said to Justice Kavanaugh, we don't think it matters whether the Court labels that under Article III or prudential ripeness, but we're happy for the Court to disagree and go to the merits because there is a fairly small window of time here for the Court to decide the merits.   On the merits, they can't satisfy either half of the test.   They're not residents and there's nothing settled about their residence.   And they've not offered any coherent theory of political representation why all illegal aliens should be included in the apportionment base. For those reasons, if the Court reaches the merits, we think it should reverse and uphold the memorandum. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, General Wall. General Underwood. "}, {"speaker": "Barbara D. Underwood", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution and laws require the seats in the House be apportioned according to the number of persons in each state.   The President's new policy of refusing to count people who are not in a lawful immigration status is flatly inconsistent with that command. Our laws reflect a deliberate choice not to base apportionment on citizenship, voter eligibility, or any other legal status but instead to count the number of people living in a state.   That has always included people who are ineligible to vote, including non-citizens, and it has also included people who were present in violation of law. The memorandum treats counting people as a reward to be withheld from states that house undocumented immigrants.   But our law views counting people for apportionment as finding fact, not giving and withholding rewards. The memorandum pretends that if under the law a person should not be here, then the person is not here.   The government can do many things to induce undocumented immigrants to leave, but it cannot declare them to be gone when, in fact, they're here and likely to remain. My friend says the policy must be upheld because some undocumented immigrants could be excluded from the count.   Whether they could is disputed, but, in any case, that would not support this policy, which applies to all undocumented immigrants and refuses to count them solely on the basis of undocumented status. As this Court recognized in Shelby County, an unlawful policy can't be saved by the possibility that a lawful policy could be written. The question here is whether a blanket policy of not counting undocumented immigrants is lawful, and it's not because undocumented status alone doesn't tell us where a person usually resides.   This policy ignores the undisputed fact that millions of undocumented immigrants have lived here for decades and have substantial community ties.   Their undocumented status doesn't erase their presence. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " General Underwood, could you tell me precisely what the relief is that you seek?

That's in both the Johnson and the Bailey dictionaries that we cite.

In July of 2019, the President issued an executive order on the collection of administrative records as they relate to citizenship, with one of the goals being to ascertain the number of undocumented immigrants in each state. And the text of that memorandum states that the Census Bureau at that time -- this was in July of 2019, so about a year-and-a-half ago -- the Census Bureau had determined based on experience that administrative record to which it already had access would enable it to determine citizenship status for approximately 90 percent of the population. So we know that the Bureau has a lot of experience with matching.   It can do it for the vast majority of the population already. That's with administrative records maintained by the Social Security Administration and other executive branch agencies. They've been collecting more records for the last year and a half.

In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment based apportionment on person, not citizens, specifically to embrace the entire immigrant population and to secure -- to secure ratification by states with large immigrant populations. And in 1929, Congress mandated apportionment on total population, the plain meaning of which does not permit exclusions for immigration status.   While the President may have some discretion in borderline cases, he does not have authority to erase millions of state residents from the apportionment based solely on unlawful immigration status. As the Latino justice amicus brief notes, undocumented immigrants contribute $1 trillion in GDP, $20 billion in federal taxes. Eighty percent are essential workers.   One in four are homeowners and pay property taxes. They're our neighbors, our coworkers, and our family members.   They are usual residents under any plausible definition of that term.

So, as I think appellees' responses confirm, there's no live or ripe case now.   So they seem to accept that the Court should just hold for a couple of weeks.   But, as you said, Mr. Chief Justice, by the time we actually run the matching and have more information, the Secretary will be ready to send his report. This is all going to happen on an extremely compressed time line in January.   And I don't think prudential ripeness should be used to await a ripe claim that could run out the clock on the President's opportunity to send a statement to Congress. On the merits, if the President can consider immigration status for any subset, then the Court needs to reverse the injunction below and take just three categories: those in ICE facilities, those who have committed crimes and are subject to final orders of removal, and those who have overstayed visas. The President could decide that it's consistent with his discretion, as the memo says, to exclude those categories from the apportionment base.   And the question then is: Do they have an enduring tie under Franklin? They don't.   They don't have a tie. We know that from Kaplan.   And even if they do, it's not enduring because they can be removed. The other side's test, which they haven't spent a lot of time defending today, is where you live or sleep most of the time.   But that doesn't fit long-term embassy personnel, federal personnel overseas, even college and boarding school students or members of Congress. The test isn't just where you lay your head at night.   It is, as Franklin says, where you have allegiance or an enduring tie. And there's no coherent theory of political representation that says every illegal alien, no matter how little time they've been here or no matter that they are imminently facing removal, is a usual or settled resident. It's the sovereign's prerogative to define the political community, as Thuraissigiam says, and the other side is left to say, look, this is just what the founders wanted.   But they don't have an explanation for why the founders would have wanted it, and that should give us pause because, whatever the founders were, they were not aimless people given to purposeless structures. The Court should vacate or reverse the judgment and the other judgments in the other cases and allow the Secretary to send his report. Finally, to you, Justice Kavanaugh, that would open up the possibility of post-apportionment litigation in the event that there is an effect on apportionment or funding. And if appellees prevail in that litigation on the basis of whatever categories are excluded and they then bring as-applied challenges, they would be asking for the same relief as in Franklin.   They'd be asking for a declaratory judgment against the Secretary of Commerce to reform his Section 141 report.   It would not be a declaratory judgment against the President. Franklin doesn't allow that. But Utah tells us that we assume that the President will comply with that judgment. There's no reason to form a -- a -- a different assumption here.   The -- the President would comply with a post-apportionment judgment. In the event that litigation ever happens -- again, we think there is a real prospect that it will not -- but, if it does, there is time enough for that to happen when you have concrete injuries and you have a definitive decision from the President on which groups will be excluded from the apportionment base. We ask that the Court vacate or reverse the judgment here and the judgments in the parallel cases. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, General.   The case is submitted. "}]
