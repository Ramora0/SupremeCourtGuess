[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case 19-1414, United States versus Cooley. Mr. Feigin. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Indian tribes, like other sovereigns, have the core inherent authority to investigate and detain suspects within their borders for the violation of another sovereign's law. Every single source that this Court looks to in assessing inherent tribal authority confirms that limited ability.   The executive has entered into numerous treaties that presuppose it, Congress has ratified those treaties and passed affirmative legislation that reflects it, courts have repeatedly upheld it, and on-the-ground law enforcement practice has long depended on it. The Ninth Circuit's decision here upsets all of those understandings.   Its tribal sovereignty analysis would logically suggest that tribes are reduced to no more than private citizens in policing rights-of-way and non-Indian land on their reservations.   And I think that's the position Respondent's taking. But even the Ninth Circuit realized how untenable that would be, so it created a novel, complicated, and ultimately unworkable law enforcement regime.   The decision below replaces familiar Fourth Amendment standards codified in the Indian Civil Rights Act with an unprecedented standard that nobody is going to know how to apply, officers or courts. It will also force tribal officers to curtail otherwise reasonable policing activities when a suspect claims to be non-Indian or the officer isn't sure about Indian status or the status of the land that he's on. The holding lacks any meaningful support, substantially chills tribes' ability even to enforce their own laws against their own members, and endangers everyone on Indian reservations.   It should be reversed. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Feigin, you -- you got my attention when you said -- began by saying every single source says that tribes have this inherent authority. I would have thought Montana said the exact opposite.   You know, you do argue at the outset there's this inherent authority and nothing took it away. But, as we said in South Dakota versus Bourland, describing it, Montana, and this is a quote, it said, \"After Montana, tribal sovereignty over non-members cannot survive without express congressional delegation and is, therefore, not inherent.\" So I would have described that as at least one source that says the opposite of what you said. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I -- I do think this Court has recognized inherent authority without express congressional authorization.   And as we discuss in our brief, we think the overall standard is the one announced in Colville and in cases before and after, which is that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, Montana -- Montana came after Colville.   And -- and I'm not saying that we haven't recognized some inherent authority, but this is a question of tribal sovereignty over non-members, and I assume that would -- would extend to criminal jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, let me make a couple points directly about Montana, Your Honor.   I think Montana is how Colville shakes out in the civil, regulatory, and adjudicatory contexts. But even if Your Honor were inclined to apply Montana in these circumstances, which don't involve criminal jurisdiction but on-the-ground policing, nobody is -- is trying or punishing crimes here, I think it would fit within the second Montana exception because it interferes with self-governance. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, I understand that -- that. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I understand that as an alternative theory, and -- and, you know, we can -- we can talk about that.   But you -- you say Montana applies to legislative and civil and regulatory.   On what basis would you suggest that executive power, such as is being exercised here, is subject to a different rule than legislative and judicial power? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, I think the Court essentially recognized that there's a distinction or at least nodded at such a distinction in both Strate and Atkinson when it expressly noted that it wasn't questioning this particular power that we're discussing here today, which is the power to stop and detain someone on public rights-of-way that run through a reservation, that the -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Feigin, the -- the Ninth Circuit analogized the police officer here to a private citizen.   And if we accept that, that the police officer is actually a private citizen here, then why does the statute, the Indian Civil Rights Act, even apply? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, the Indian Civil Rights Act contains a very broad definition of the governmental activities of the tribe, and I think it probably would still apply, but I think that's another inconsistency in the Ninth Circuit's opinion that I think makes its conclusion ultimately untenable, which is that they recognize some sovereign authority in one respect, as you note, and then deprive the tribal officer of it in another respect. And I don't think that citizens arrest authority is at all workable or at all what anyone has ever contemplated.   Among other things, I don't think citizens arrest authority by anyone's likes would include the ability to do a Terry stop based on reasonable suspicion, which is what traffic stops are, let alone a frisk for weapons. And I think everyone's assumed that tribes can do much more than that, as the treaties reflect, as the statutes reflect, and as on-the-ground practice reflects. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So, if we -- if -- if we find that -- that the officer here was within his jurisdiction to engage in this stop, do we have to -- should we ultimately reverse here, or should we send it back to have it analyzed to determine whether or not Terry is satisfied? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " I think, if you ultimately agree with -- with us, Justice Thomas, I do think this needs to go back for a Fourth Amendment analysis -- for a Fourth Amendment analysis, if that's your question. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Do you, in your discussion with the Chief Justice with respect to Montana, do you think that -- you know, Lara was decided after that and it seemed to undercut Montana.   Could you discuss that just a bit? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I don't think that Montana no longer applies to the situations that it applied. After Lara, you have Plains Commerce Bank, which very clearly applies Montana in the contexts to which I -- I think it's clearly applicable, namely, civil, regulatory, and adjudicatory legislation. And we're not asking this Court to say that Montana's curtailed in any way because I don't think the Court needs to say that.   I think it's pretty clear from Strate and I -- I believe Your Honor's opinion in Atkinson that the authority we're talking about today is meaningfully different. The main logic of not subjecting non-Indians to tribal adjudication or legislation is that they have no say in making those laws.   Here, this is about the enforcement of laws to which they're -- the non-Indians are indubitably subject -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " -- namely, state and federal law. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Do you -- would you like to and could you help explain to me an ordinary state policeman has certain authority to make arrests or to investigate situations on an interstate highway.   How -- how in your view does the tribal policeman have the same or a lesser authority and why? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " So, Your Honor, I think, if the -- at the outset, it's just an inherent sovereign authority that sovereigns can investigate and detain at least briefly and reasonably for violations of other sovereigns' laws. In the context of states, for example, you have the Interstate Rendition Clause of the Constitution that presupposes states can enforce each other's laws.   You have this Court's decisions in Di Re and Miller that make, I think, fairly clear that states can enforce federal law. That reflects, Justice Breyer, well-accepted international law principles that allow this.   I -- I'd point you to the Court's decision in United States against Raucher, which is in 117 of the U.S. Reports. And if you look at page 218 of Neil Boister's \"Introduction to Transnational Criminal Law,\" you'll see that the procedural law that's usually applied is -- the procedural law that's understood to apply when there's a -- a hand-over of someone is the procedural law of the state that's doing the handing over, not the state that's accepting delivery, that that nation is only applying its substantive law. And the authority that we're asking for here for tribes and that we think tribes have always had and that everyone's always assumed that they had is a -- a -- a more limited authority than even the courts recognize the states have. It's not the authority to do a full-blown arrest.   It's not an arrest in their own authority that kicks off an adjudicatory process.   It's just investigation and detention in a complementary role.   If the state or the federal government says, no, we don't want this person, the tribe has to let him go. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why do they have the authority to, say, enforce or arrest anyway or hold people whom they believe reasonably are violating Montana law, but then they can't try that person for violating the Indian tribe law? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, the logic that this Court's applied for not having non-Indians subject to the tribe's criminal adjudicatory authority is that they have no say in making those laws. That's really not the case here.   This is just complementary enforcement.   And, Your Honor, it's practically necessary. As this Court has recognized and as Congress has recognized, these -- these areas are policed primarily often by tribal officers. And if they lack this authority, it's going to endanger everyone on the reservation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Feigin, do you think you could offer us a general test for distinguishing between those aspects of sovereignty that tribes retained and those that they did not? So, if you -- if I gave you this partial sentence, I wonder if you could complete it: Tribes retain those aspects of sovereignty that -- fill in the rest. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " That are -- I mean, I don't think I can do a better job than the Court did in -- in Colville and in, after that, San Carlos reiterating this and in -- in other cases, which is they retain the inherent authority so long as it's not inconsistent with the overriding interests of the federal government. And the Court gave three examples of things that would be inconsistent, namely, foreign relations or control over the alienation of tribal land to non- -- non-Indians or the adjudication of various matters against non-Indians.   But, as I've said, I -- I think this is meaningfully different for -- for a number of reasons. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Does the authority you claim the tribes retain go further than simply detaining a non-Indian on reasonable suspicion? I think you -- you just said in answer to Justice Breyer that a tribal officer could not actually make an arrest. Could the -- could the officer make a -- the kind of search incident to arrest that would otherwise be possible? For example, if a non-Indian was in the car -- in a car, could the officer search areas of the car that the person could grab and might have -- where there might be a weapon hidden? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Yes, an officer could certainly do that.   I mean, that's sort of part of the -- recognized as an ordinary part of a traffic stop. To -- to the extent your question encompasses this, we also think an officer could do a search of the car pursuant to the post-Gant rationales. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, suppose a -- suppose a tribal officer is -- is -- is not -- is not stopping a car on the highway but is driving around the reservation and sees through the window of a house owned by a non-Indian on a parcel of land that this individual owns and see that there is drugs in plain view. Could -- what can the officer do under those circumstances? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " I -- I do think that the officer can go in and -- and do a detention there, and then he -- he has to obviously act reasonably when he does so, and part of acting reasonably is recognizing that he's in a complementary role and he needs to, as Officer Saylor did here, contact state and federal authorities as quickly as is reasonably possible under -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Thank you.   Thank you, Mr. Feigin. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Feigin, basically, in your briefs, you've argued that this Court should look to whether the exercise of tribal sovereignty would be consistent with the overriding interests of the federal government. I'm not quite sure what that has to do with much.   Shouldn't we be looking at what rights the Indians, the tribal Indians, have been given? And, here, it seems to me that inherent in a detention-and-hold right is the right to investigation. The Ninth Circuit basically said that they can investigate to find out if someone's an Indian or not.   And if they're an Indian, presumably, they would have all the rights of further investigation.   But I don't know why the Ninth Circuit's limited view of what the right of detention means should control us. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, Justice Sotomayor, it -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And -- and -- and isn't that a simpler argument than all the arguments that -- about sovereignty that everyone's been having? If it's a contractual right the Indians have been given, there's no constitutional violation in just being held for the police to determine whether or not you're guilty of a crime sufficient to be arrested. Why can't we just go in -- on that simple basis? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, to the extent that you would reach the -- the same result that we're urging today that would preserve traditional understandings of a tribe's authority, I don't -- I don't know that we have a huge interest in -- in deterring you from reaching that by the analytical path that you've described. But I do think that, as a general matter, we do have some interest in this Court reaffirming the existence of inherent tribal authority, which I think pervades this Court's cases.   And I think this encompasses the authority that we're talking about today.   And I do think that's actually the most straightforward and -- and the best way to reach this result. I -- I -- I'm not here contending that Congress affirmatively granted the authority here.   I think that tribes have always had it. They've always been understood to have it.   If you look at the reports, for example, the law professors' historical brief, they've exercised it and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So, if one of my colleagues thinks that Montana controls, you lose it? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " No, Your Honor.   As I was explaining to the Chief Justice, if Montana controls, and we don't think it does, but, if it does, I think this fits under self-governance because it chills enforcement even of tribal law against tribal members because it's difficult to tell -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, my time is out, but I'm not sure -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- that this is the extreme impact on sovereignty that Montana references. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Feigin, if you could continue with this point.   I guess what I'd like to know is, if there are these two alternative ways that you could have written your brief, and one is the inherent authority way, which you, in fact, used, and the other is the Montana exception 2 way, what are the different consequences of the Court proceeding along either of these paths? And why did you make the choice that you did? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, just to be clear, I -- I do think the Montana exception 2 choice is an exercise of inherent authority, so I don't know that we're saying anything terribly different. The -- the reason we didn't make the argument that this fits into Montana exception 2, our primary argument is because we just don't think Montana applies.   I -- I think it really only governs civil, adjudicatory, and regulatory jurisdiction. But if -- I take Your Honor's question to want me to continue my answer to Justice Sotomayor, which is that this chills self-governance because it's difficult to tell what kind -- as this Court is familiar with, what kind of land you're on, first of all, and I think the Ninth Circuit's ruling would probably apply to non-Indian fee land.   This Court's decided numerous cases in which that issue, the issue of land status, reaches this Court. It's also -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess, Mr. Feigin, I really was just asking about -- you said we just don't think Montana applies.   But, other than sort of analytic purity in your mind, you have no -- you don't see any real difference between the two approaches? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, I do think it has broader implications for Indian sovereignty, and I -- I would urge the Court to keep Montana where -- where I think it has always been.   And I do think Strate and Atkinson reflect an understanding by the Court that this isn't a Montana situation, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I -- I guess what I'm really asking is, like, what -- what are these different implications? I mean, I'm just sort of not understanding why you're pushing down one road rather than the other and -- and thought I'd just ask you, why are you pushing down one road rather than the other? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Your Honor, I'm not -- I'm not sure it may -- ultimately makes a difference in the outcome in this case, but the federal government does have a very strong interest in preserving tribal authority and -- and tribal sovereignty where appropriate.   And I wouldn't want the Court to take this occasion to restrict it even further by suggesting that Montana is the controlling test in -- in all circumstances.   I'm not sure that this Court's precedents really support that result. And the Court could -- could leave that for another day and simply -- if -- if the Court prefers, simply assume that Montana exception 2 applies and explain why this fits into Montana exception 2.

I -- I -- I guess I would have approached this thinking that tribal sovereignty remains until and unless Congress has withdrawn it in some fashion and that the relevant question here is, what -- what does the Major Crimes Act do to Indian sovereignty? And, there, it's clear that Congress has withdrawn jurisdiction to try certain non-native people in certain locations within Indian country.   Fine. My question approaching it that way, Mr. Feigin, is, where is the line? The Major Crimes Act clearly precludes states or -- or tribes from trying certain individuals, non-native persons, for -- for major crimes in Indian country. But you say it's okay, on the other hand, to -- for a tribal officer to conduct a Terry stop.   There's a long distance between a Terry stop and a trial.   Where does -- where does the Major Crimes Act kick in to reduce tribal sovereignty? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " I -- I'm not actually certain that I would identify the Major Crimes Act as necessarily what -- what draws the jurisdiction here, but if you -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I -- I understand that, but if you could address it based on the premise I've given you. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Certainly, Your Honor.   I think where the Major Crimes Act would kick off is -- is something that is considered the beginning of the adjudicatory process.   So we're not urging here that tribes have full-blown arrest authority, which I think would be understood as the beginning of the adjudicatory process. So I think the line would be around where we have described it in our briefs, which is a limited detention and investigatory authority that's simply for the purpose of allowing state or federal authorities at some point to take over and conduct an arrest. I think that's confirmed by the statutes in -- in 25 U.S.C. 2804 and -- and surrounding it, which contemplate cross-designation if the federal government wants someone -- wants a tribal officer to be able to conduct an arrest. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, if -- if you're going to look to the deputization statute, why doesn't that just foreclose even a Terry stop? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, if you -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " You say it forecloses an arrest.   Why wouldn't it go so far as to foreclose a Terry stop? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, if you look at 25 U.S.C. 2806(d), it expressly preserves the investigatory and -- and other relevant powers that tribes possessed before. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Oh, yeah, but you're saying they -- they possessed that authority antecedent to any statute.   And -- and -- and I guess my question, again, is, where does that sovereign authority end that's been preserved? And why would it stop at Terry as opposed to an arrest? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Your Honor, if you think it continues fully through an arrest, we wouldn't oppose that result.   But I think that might be close -- I do think the arrest is normally understood to kick off an adjudicatory process. I don't think that tribes have been understood to have the authority to conduct arrests on their own.   For example, if you look at page 99 of the Indian Law and Order Commission's report, which is cited in the former U.S. Attorneys' amicus brief, they do draw -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Thank -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric J.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Feigin.   Does the authority here come from the Constitution?

"}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And I guess my question remains, does that come from the Constitution, or how does that fit within the Constitution? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " I think, within the Constitution, we have the -- you know, the power to conduct commerce with Indian tribes, which recognizes that tribes are separate sovereigns in -- in a sense, and it comes from this Court's cases construing inherent tribal authority, which I think reflect that tribes do retain some authority. I think the Constitution simply recognizes that.   I don't think it's -- I don't think the authority we're discussing today is -- is affirmatively granted by the Constitution. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And I -- it's not affirmatively granted by the Constitution.   You also said it's not affirmatively granted by Congress, I think you said in response to Justice Sotomayor.   Correct? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " That's right.   I -- I -- I would just emphasize, Justice Kavanaugh, that I do think it is recognized by both of those sources, but I don't think that it is -- we're not looking to some specific provision of either of them as the source of the authority. I -- I think the way the Court has looked at this kind of question is whether it's been withdrawn, as Justice Gorsuch was just saying, and nothing has withdrawn it. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " The other side says this is, in effect, a separation of powers case and that Congress has given the executive the authority to enter into cross-deputization and that hasn't been done here and that, instead of the courts jumping in, we should let Congress and the Executive Branch fill any public policy holes that may exist.   Your response? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " I think I have three responses. One is 25 U.S.C. 2806(d), as I was just mentioning to Justice Gorsuch, which preserves the preexisting authority. The second is, as we lay out in our reply brief, the cross-designation authority is great -- contemplated as a greater authority here and requires agreements that would -- have monitoring and compliance requirements for tribes that present difficulties. And, third, the current cross-designation statutes don't address the issue of steam law, for example, and so we're left with, if we really were trying to solve this problem by cross-designation, it would take some new acts of Congress.   And that could be said in any inherent authority case. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Feigin. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Barrett. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Feigin, I'd like to go back to your interchange with Justice Gorsuch.   You said that the authority -- the investigative authority doesn't extend past Terry stops into arrests because arrests mark the beginning of the adjudicatory process. We -- I -- I didn't quite follow whether you were saying to Justice Gorsuch that the reason why tribes lack authority to arrest is because they are implicitly divested of that authority under the Constitution, so even under the Colville rationale or whether it's the cross-deputization statutes or whether it's our prior cases making clear that tribes lack the authority to finally adjudicate the rights, criminally or civilly, of non-members. So could you just explain to me what it is that takes away that authority, or is it that they never possessed it in the first place? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " I think they did possess it in the first place, Justice Barrett, just the same way the Court recognized in Di Re and Miller that states have that authority. I -- I mean, if the Court wants to say that they have that authority, I wouldn't resist it necessarily, but I do think that this Court's decisions primarily that recognized that non-Indians cannot be subject to tribal adjudication is one line of demarcation. And, also, as I suggested to Justice Gorsuch and I think fleshed out a little bit more with Justice Kavanaugh, I think the cross-designation statutes at least contemplate that there will be some kind of affirmative conferral of authority if tribal officers are to conduct arrests that effectively stand in the shoes of federal officer arrests. So I would probably draw the line before we reach that point.   And I think, you know, the -- the authority that we're urging here today does stop short of that point because it requires immediately, as soon as reasonable, contacting state and federal authorities. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well, this is my problem, and I'm not suggesting that I think we should say that it stretches that far, but I'm trying to figure out what rationale says that the tribes would retain the authority to do a Terry stop but not to arrest, particularly when you think about the fact that, I mean, one -- one reason for the practical problems that you identify is that it's difficult for federal or state authorities to police the public rights-of-way that go through reservations. So, if a tribal officer does a Terry stop, I mean, a Terry stop's supposed to be temporary, who knows how long it might take for a state or federal officer to get there. And then, at some point, you know, as you get -- I don't know, at some point, it seems like that would mature into an arrest. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, let me -- let me just try to clarify this.   I -- I think, in some sense, we're having a little bit of just a terminological debate about what an arrest means.   There may be some things that would be colloquially considered an arrest but not formally considered an arrest, and we do think the tribe can do that. As our brief makes clear, we do think they can hold a suspect on probable cause for a reasonable period of time for hand-over, unless and until state and federal authorities tell the tribe that they don't want the person.

I just want to emphasize how unworkable the regime that the Ninth Circuit and Respondent contemplate would be.   It would require an uncertain on-the-spot determination of someone's tribal status or Indian status, which is often impossible to do, land status, which is often impossible to do. I don't really think there have been any cases fleshing out the apparent or obvious standard contemplated by the Ninth Circuit or really exploring the mere authority of private citizens arrests, which is what Respondent would leave them with. And it would curtail policing activity that everyone depends on, the ability to respond to a 911 call, like in Navarette, the ability to stop and frisk someone who's casing a jewelry store on non-tribal fee land, like in Terry against Ohio itself. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Henkel. "}, {"speaker": "Eric R. Henkel", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is resolved by the fundamental propositions that Indian tribes do not possess sovereign authority over non-Indians and that Congress has plenary authority over Indian affairs. The decision below should be affirmed because the detention, search, and arrest of a non-Indian by a tribal officer exceeds tribal self-government authority.   I have three basic points to make today. First, Indian tribes do not have inherent police power over non-Indians, especially on non-tribal lands. Second, Congress addressed this issue by giving the Executive Branch broad authority to cross-deputize tribal officers to investigate and police federal crime in Indian country. Finally, no matter why the tribal officer in this case was not cross-deputized, that fact is not a basis to find inherent tribal police power over non-Indians.   Instead, it is a basis to respect separation of powers and defer to Congress's plenary authority. The government disregards the unique and limited character of inherent tribal sovereignty.   It not only asks this Court to find inherent tribal authority to regulate and police the conduct of non-Indians; it insists that tribes have unlimited authority to police all persons and to enforce all tribal, state, and federal laws governing Indian country. And the government claims this sweeping police authority over U.S. citizens is consistent with overriding federal interests, even though tribes exercise that authority outside the structure of the Constitution, free of political accountability, and cloaked with immunity from civil liability. The government's position is untenable.   It ignores that tribal sovereignty is confined to managing tribal land, protecting tribal self-government, and controlling internal relations.   In this case, because the exercise of police authority over Mr. Cooley was unrelated to any of these limited interests, the Crow Tribe exceeded its sovereign authority. The decision below should be affirmed. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Your friend on the other side says there's inherent authority and it hasn't been -- the question is whether it's been taken away. He cites Colville.   I understand your argument to be that, under Montana and subsequent cases interpreting it, there is no inherent authority. But even under Montana, there are exceptions, exceptions in which we've recognized that there is continuing inherent authority, and I wonder why the second exception doesn't apply here.   That exception is when the conduct at issue threatens tribal self-governance, self-rule, which we've talked about in terms of political integrity, economic security, health and welfare. What could threaten that more than the idea that you can't do anything about somebody within the reservation that you have good reason to believe is violating criminal law?

So consider the situation where the tribal officer has reasonable suspicion that a driver is driving under the influence and would present a danger if allowed to continue to drive, but the officer is pretty certain this person is not an Indian.

"}, {"speaker": "Eric R. Henkel", "text": " I -- I'm not accepting that, no.   I -- I think the first place to start is a line of analysis that this Court gave in Plains Commerce Bank, where the Court expressly rejected, you know, drawing some sort of parallel between tribal authority and what state and federal authorities they can do. Those -- that line of argument, this Court said, completely overlooks the very reasons that cases like Montana and Oliphant and this one even exist, which is that the sovereign authority of Indian tribes is limited in ways state and federal authority is not. And the -- and the way that it's more limited is because they are not full territorial sovereigns.   They do not have authority over all who come within their borders. So I think, when you start from that proposition and then you're -- any analysis -- any analogy to, you know, state authority to enforce federal law and -- and vice versa, I mean, there's -- there's no comparison right out of the gate because states and federal authorities are full territorial sovereigns.

And then -- so there's a legitimate state investigation, and then they ultimately work with the federal government on handing over the evidence, and there's a federal prosecution.

Suppose that there is some permissible role here for tribal authorities, and also suppose that in the course of a stop, that the tribal authority engages in some conduct that would violate the Constitution and that your client wanted to pursue a civil claim for that violation if -- if -- of course, in -- in the state context, there would be 1983; in the federal officer context, there would be Bivens. What -- what remedy would be available -- perhaps you haven't given this thought, but, if you have, I'm curious what remedy you think might be available against a tribal officer.

And good morning, Mr. Henkel.   You make what I think are forceful separation-of-powers arguments, particularly that Congress has provided for cross-deputization, and that was not taken advantage of here.   So I take that point, and that's an important one for me. But, at the same time, a couple other thoughts that I'll throw out there, and then you can react to them. The amicus brief from the former U.S. Attorneys says that \"criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is an indefensible morass of complex, conflicting, and illogical commands layered in over decades via congressional policies and court decisions and without the consent of tribal nations.\" And I don't think you're going to disagree with that description necessarily, and so that leads me to think that one of the things we should be trying to do here is -- is to do no harm because there's lots of ripple effects from a broad decision. And with that in mind, there are statements in our decisions in Duro and Strate that really cut directly against you, as you're -- you're well aware.   And you can say those are dicta, and that might be correct, but those have guided the law -- law enforcement for several decades.   I think Congress and the executive could reasonably rely on those statements in the Court's decision.   Certainly, the Cohen treatise treats those statements as authoritative in terms of guidance. So why isn't the best thing we can do here just to stick with what we said in those cases? It's not very analytically satisfying, but it's a narrow result that does not make a morass, as it was described, any worse.   What do you think? "}, {"speaker": "Eric R. Henkel", "text": " You mean stick with the -- the statements about detaining and ejecting from the reservation? "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Eric R. Henkel", "text": " I -- I -- I think those statements are -- the problem with those beyond -- you're -- you're right, I -- I think they're dicta, and I think that they -- Duro, for example, was talking about the exclusion power, which we don't have here.   But the biggest problem I see under your proposal is that the Court has not defined the source or the scope of what this detain-and-eject power is. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, that's why -- that's why I said it's not analytically all that satisfying, but it's been out there for 30 years, and as described in the Cohen handbook, which is useful, as you -- you're well aware, it says, \"The Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed the authority of tribal police to arrest offenders within Indian country and detain them until they can be turned over to the proper authorities, even if the tribe itself would lack criminal jurisdiction.\" That's the black-letter description. "}, {"speaker": "Eric R. Henkel", "text": " I -- I think the terms \"arrest,\" \"detain,\" and \"turn over\" are being used fairly loosely.   I think we -- what -- what's happening -- look at what happened here. There was a detention, an investigation, pulling Mr. Cooley out of the car, putting him in the back of the patrol unit, which I would argue is an arrest, and then going back to his vehicle multiple times to search it for, you know, evidence of crime. And that is far -- I -- I don't think this Court was saying anything like that in Duro or in Strate.   It was just they have a general power to eject outsiders from reservations.

I mean, on the one hand, as Justice Kavanaugh points out, it's not very analytically satisfying to rely on the dicta, particularly from the footnote in Strate. But I want to try this on -- you know, you say one problem with our -- you know, or the government's approach or an approach saying that there is some sort of retained authority to police here is that we haven't identified its scope or its source. But, you know, Montana and those cases that followed it relied pretty heavily on the unfairness of imposing tribal law on those who didn't participate in its creation.   And in that respect, Strate's footnote is perfectly consistent with that because, as the United States pointed out in argument and in its brief, you know, Cooley and -- and other non-members of the tribe are represented in the creation of federal law. And so it doesn't pose that same problem here.   It's -- it's far less of an unfairness, and Strate's footnote can be seen to be consistent with that principle, particularly if the United States is right that one way to understand Montana is that that is an instance of implied preemption that cashes out when you consider the assertion of authority to adjudicate finally civil or criminal liability or the imposition of regulations on those who didn't participate in its exercise.

And -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Okay.   Well, let me -- let me just stop you there so I can ask this question too.   Justice Thomas was asking you, you know, the same hypothetical as Mr. Cooley's stop but substituting in a serial killer.

And I assume that that might be an exercise of what the Ninth Circuit described as the apparent or obvious violation of law. That -- that's a new phrase, right? We have reasonable suspicion.   We have probable cause.   How do you tell if something's an apparent and obvious violation of the law? "}, {"speaker": "Eric R. Henkel", "text": " I -- I -- I think that the obvious and apparent standard is a product of the -- the rule at common law, which is that -- for private citizens arrests, which also apply to officers and territory -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But how do you apply it? "}, {"speaker": "Eric R. Henkel", "text": " Yeah, so I think that it -- you apply it in terms of -- I forget who posed the hypothetical before of drugs being visible.   Certainly, if drugs are visible, there is an apparent crime. But I also think there is a breach of the peace aspect when there's something imminent about to occur, when there's public safety that's, you know, in jeopardy and it's in jeopardy now, then there can -- there's authority to step in and detain.

Through decades of consistent opinions, this Court has delineated the scope of that authority to exclude police power over non-Indians, especially on non-tribal lands such as the public right-of-way here, where Officer Saylor seized and searched Mr. Cooley. Moreover, to the extent this absence of tribal police authority creates a jurisdictional gap in reservation law enforcement, Congress has already filled the gap by providing for cross-deputization of tribal officers. The fact that relevant officials did not avail themselves of cross-deputization in this case does not justify usurping Congress's plenary authority with a judicial finding of inherent tribal authority. Mr. Cooley does not challenge tribal sovereignty.   He simply asks that the boundaries of tribal sovereignty be respected as this Court has previously defined them. The court of appeals decision should be affirmed.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Feigin? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Thank you, Your Honor. I would just want to make four relatively quick points.   One is just to touch on remedies for potentially unlawful action. Beyond the exclusionary rule, there would be a suit in tribal court, I think the tribes have every incentive to be solicitous of such a suit because they don't want to get cross-wise with the other authorities. If the officer is a non-Indian, he can be -- which a surprising number of them are -- he can be sued in state court.   If they -- if tribes -- if a tribal officer really exceeds his boundaries, the federal government could come in and prosecute. And then there -- there could be legislative or executive action that simply precludes these hand-overs if Congress actually perceived a problem.   But no one's identified any history of abuses. Second, cross-designation is simply not a solution.   If you look at our brief and the Cayuga Nation brief, they detail the problems with that.   Just because someone has a -- in particular, they're fickle and you need them with multiple agencies.   You can't just have one with the federal government.   You'd need one with state or local authorities as well. The third point I -- I wanted to make was to just reinforce why this would be an example of Montana exception 2, assuming that it applies.   It's because of the chilling effect on enforcement against even Indians. I -- I take it that if someone were driving around with a bumper sticker that said, \"I am not an Indian,\" they couldn't be stopped. The indeterminacy problems are not solvable by a quick radio call.   Issues like tribal status and land status are frequently litigated. They have to at least be resolved back at the station.   And under the Ninth Circuit's rule, Officer Saylor, who is a member of the tribe, couldn't even protect himself from what he thought was a potential attack by -- by the Respondent here. And then, finally, I'd just like to emphasize, I think, the incoherence of the approach that the other side is urging.   They say that you can detain someone who matches the description of a serial killer. Well, how sure do you have to be that he matches the description of the serial killer? Where is that authority coming from? So what if he's not 100 percent sure, or what if he, instead of knowing he matches the description of a serial killer, he simply sees a bloody knife on the passenger seat and he knows that a woman on the reservation has recently been brutally murdered by knife? He has to have the authority to detain.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
