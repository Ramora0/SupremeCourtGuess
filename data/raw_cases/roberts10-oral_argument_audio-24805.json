[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-1717, the American Legion versus the American Humanist Association, and Number 18-18, the consolidated case, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission versus the American Humanist Association. Mr. Katyal. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are four important facts about the memorial at issue, the Peace Cross, that explain why it should not be dismembered or destroyed. First, families and the Legion built it 93 years ago to commemorate 49 brave souls who gave their lives in World War I, and it has stood for -- since that time without challenge. Second, it's no ordinary cross.   At its center, in its heart, is the American Legion symbol.   It's gigantic.   And at the base in four capital -- huge capital letters are words: Valor, Endurance, Courage, Devotion. Third, not a single word of religious content appears anywhere; rather, the base has a nine-foot plaque listing the 49 names with an inscription to them. And, fourth, the monument is situated in Veterans Memorial Park alongside other war memorials. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Do you know how many other parks are like this one? I've looked at pictures, and this is an unusual park because there's major highways dividing it up. It's almost as if the city artificially designed an area that's huge to encompass other plaques and declared it a park.   But you can't really tell that this cross is with anything else.   There's three or four -- six-lane highway on one side.   There's another highway on the other.   I'm told you can't even get off the highways to walk to this cross.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Oh, no, you actually can. I've done it.   There's parking and so on.   So I -- I disagree with that representation. Veterans Memorial Park has been there for a long time, the record shows at least since 1983.   So this isn't like McCreary, in which there's some pretextual stuff added later -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And you said \"dismember or destroy.\" You can move it. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " You could -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You could transfer the land to private entities, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, you could -- those -- those would be hypothetically possible, but the record shows that both -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So is destruction and -- and anything else. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well -- well, Justice Sotomayor, the record -- this is at Court of Appeals Appendix Joint -- Joint Appendix 623 and 1585 -- say if you move it, because of the cracks in this cross, it very well may be destroyed.   And as far -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Then give it back to the Legion. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " And give it back to the Legion.   As our -- as our petition reply brief at page 12 points out, they have an e-mail in this case saying they know that Maryland can't do that because of the traffic concerns.   They can't give it to a private entity.   The Maryland brief before this Court also makes the same claim. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They could -- they could speak to that.   But putting that aside, are you relying on the fact that -- at all, that -- at least one brief claims that all 49 soldiers named on this plaque or for whom this plaque were were Christian? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Not at all, Your Honor. We think this memorial, from start to finish, has been about honoring those 49, plus all World War I veterans. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Is it -- are you just grandfathering this, or are you claiming that today, let's say, for the Vietnam War, that any government, local or state, could build a cross 40 feet high, not put any emblem on or some sectarian emblem, and say we are dedicating this to all the soldiers who have died in the Vietnam War? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So we're not at all saying that, grandfathering or anything like that.   This case, because of its 93-year tradition, is an easy one and for reasons Justice Breyer said in Van Orden -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, no, but answer my question.   What is the tradition? Is the tradition that, in World War II, a cross was used, or is the tradition that the government can put up sectarian symbols, like crosses or a picture of Jesus Christ, in honor of anyone because that's within the nation's tradition? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So, Justice Sotomayor, I'll make two different arguments.   One is with respect to this cross, which has stood for 93 years, 86 of them without challenge, and for reasons Justice Breyer's opinion in Van Orden said -- and the Buono plurality -- that would make this cross constitutional. Now your question is, well, what about this tradition of crosses in general? And it's true we have a second argument about Town of Greece, which says that, if there is a long tradition of the type of displays, that would make it constitutional. Notably, however, it doesn't make your hypothetical constitutional.   Your hypothetical's actually a real case.   Lake County, the Seventh Circuit case in 1993, is a huge cross with Jesus Christ nailed in the center of it, in a public park.   It's been there since 1955.   And it was protested right then.   And the Seventh Circuit said that is unconstitutional.   And we agree. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What would happen if all the facts that you gave were the same, except for the 93 years? In other words, a community decides, for whatever reason, we don't have a World War I memorial; we want to put up exactly this to memorialize the -- the -- the war dead from -- from World War I, but now. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Right.   So, if it's a war memorial, we do think that it would be constitutional.   We think that there might be some skepticism.   You'd just want to make sure that it wasn't a pretext and it didn't look like that cross as I was describing about Lake County.   But, if it was a cross like this one, same facts, Justice Kagan, we do think that would be constitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and does that answer apply not just to memorials for World War I soldiers but to memorials for soldiers from any armed conflict? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, I think that -- I think that it probably would, that there's a tradition of using these crosses with respect to any conflict, but it would have to look like this one. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But, Mr. Katyal, what about, not a World -- World War or any war memorial, but a memorial to a tragic event, let's say, a mass shooting at a school? Could the local community then decide it wants to put up a cross in front of that school to honor the children and the teachers who died in the mass shooting? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, I think the test, Justice Ginsburg, would be whether there is a independent secular purpose.   So take a real case, like the one that came out of the World Trade Centers, the Second Circuit case from 2014, where two steel beams were discovered in the rubble, and they were put up in the shape -- they were put up in the shape of a cross. Now, if that were in a public park, I think that that would be permissible because it has independent historic value and independent secular value, showing values of resilience and courage. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But my -- my example was nothing that was found in the rubble.   It's just the local community decides it wants to honor the dead in this terrible tragedy. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Right.   The test would be whether or not there's an independent secular purpose.   I don't think you could probably harken back to the same tradition that you could with respect to, for example, these World War I crosses, Fields of Flanders -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The purpose -- the purpose is to honor those who died in the tragedy. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So -- yeah, so, no, could you -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " I don't think purpose is what this Court's decisions turn on.   Van Orden, the Buono plurality say that it's -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I'm sorry, but I -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- objective meaning. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- I thought you just said that the test is whether there's a secular purpose. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " I meant objective meaning, I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.   The test is, as -- as your opinion that you joined in Buono said, what is the objective meaning of this display? Now sometimes purpose is relevant to that, and the Court has looked to it, but the test is always that. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, would that be -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So it would be okay then -- it would be okay to put up in front of the public school -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, I think we'd need to know more about the facts of that particular hypothetical, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, here are some facts, Mr. Katyal, from that hypothetical.   And you can understand how something like this can come about, that people want to memorialize the dead, and in one religious tradition, and a dominant one in many, many communities of this country, the preeminent symbol to memorialize the dead is the Latin cross.   And -- and so they gravitate toward that symbol as a way to memorialize the dead. But, at the same time, for members of other faiths, that symbol is not a way to memorialize the dead and does not have that meaning. So I think that the question that Justice Ginsburg is asking, you know, for many people, this is a very natural way to do exactly what they want to do.   For others, not. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " And, Justice Kagan, if it does have the same hallmarks as this type of cross, we think that that would be permissible, that is -- and I think that's a natural consequence of what this Court's already said in Buono in the plurality and the Van Orden opinion. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I thought -- I read your brief to put a lot of weight on the fact that the cross here has more than a sectarian meaning, because, as your history sets forth, the cross was a symbol throughout the battlefields in World War I. Now I'm wondering why that doesn't limit your argument in -- so that, in such a case, as Justice Kagan hypothesized, you would not accept that? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, we certainly agree that all of that tradition, the Fields of Flanders and stuff, make this a very easy case.   And we don't think you need to go further than that. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " In the Field of Flanders, are all of the graves marked by crosses? Are there not graves marked by Stars of David? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " There certainly are some. But I think the dominant image of the time, everything from that poem to art, to the war bond advertisements that the United States Government put, to the 1924 congressional resolution, all did use this cross. And that's why we agree, Justice Ginsburg -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And I visited some of those battlefields, and there are Stars of Davids marking the graves of Jewish -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Quite -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- soldiers. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- quite true.   We're not disagreeing with that.   We're just saying that here -- and this is what the Buono plurality recognized, and Justice Alito's separate opinion -- that there is a secular meaning with respect to these crosses. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What do you say to the Jewish war veterans brief that say and for those Jewish soldiers, the government's decision to honor only the salvation that Christians believe is hurtful, wrong, and not in keeping with the promise of the Constitution? What do you say to them? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " I -- I'd say three things, Justice Kavanaugh, and then if I could reserve the balance of my time. The first is that, factually, one of the main proponents in fundraisers of this particular cross was J. Moses Eldovich, who himself was a Jewish veteran. Second, there's a -- there's a contrary tradition that the Retired Flag Officers brief at page 9 says that some Jewish vets were actually put and buried under the cross and wanted to be. And, third, I don't think this Court has ever adopted the view that, if some people disagree with something, that that itself creates an Establishment Clause violation. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If -- if the Chief would per -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Rather, the test is objective meaning. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If the Chief would permit me.   There is a brief here that says that, to deeply religious Christians, secularizing the cross is blasphemy.   Christ died on the cross.   He was resurrected from his grave.   So those people don't view secularizing the cross as something -- it's not just Jewish people or Hindu people who might be offended. It could be Christians as well. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, my answer would be the same as the third part to Justice Kavanaugh.   I don't think we let those objectors dictate that. If that were the rule, you'd be tearing down crosses at Arlington Cemetery and nationwide.   The U.S. brief at page 29 says that. And I think that would actually inject this Court and create more of an Establishment Clause problem and sow religious divisions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Carvin. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While the Peace Cross should be upheld under any sensible Establishment Clause analysis, we submit the Court should analyze it under the Town of Greece coercion test, which prohibits tangible interference with religious liberty, as well as proselytizing, for a number of reasons. We think this is the simplest route. You would simply extend Town of Greece rule for religious speech to symbolic speech and it would provide, in a situation where the chances for coercion and proselytization are much less than in the communal prayer -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Carvin, could you explain -- you have this coercion theory that you think you're urging us to adopt. But, if that's what the Establishment Clause prohibits, only coercion, how does this offer -- how does this office differ from the Free Exercise Clause? That is, can you suggest a practice that would be unconstitutionally coercive under the Establishment Clause and yet be inoffensive under the Free Exercise Clause? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, forcing us to pay threepence to a minister.   That would violate my negative liberty not to support a church I don't want to, but it wouldn't violate any religious tenets or my ability to pursue the religion I do want to. So it creates a negative liberty not to support coercively religions which you do not support. I would also point out that this standard is completely the correct one under the text and history of the Establishment Clause because, when they were discussing all the hallmarks of establishment, what they were talking about was tangible interference. It also extends to proselytizing under this Court's decisions in both Town of Greece and the Allegheny County dissent, which is what we're asking the Court to adopt. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What -- what counts as proselytizing? I think I understand what coercion means better than what proselytizing means. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well, I think it's actually very straightforward.   The definition is preaching conversion.   The lower courts have said this is add -- aggressively advocating conversion from one sect to another. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " What's the difference between that and an endorsement? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well, there's -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " You tell us we should abandon Lemon's endorsement test because it's become a dog's breakfast. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And nobody knows how to apply it. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " The circuit courts are confused, you tell us. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " It's not that -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And then you replace it with coercion but now maybe proselytizing in the reply brief. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I'm -- I -- I don't see the daylight between proselytizing and endorsement.   Can you help me out? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " We think there's a fundamental difference, Justice Gorsuch.   Under our test, all symbolic, including sectarian, symbols would be presumptively valid, except in the rare circumstances where they've been misused to proselytize, whereas, under the endorsement test, all -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, suppose a city -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- all sectarian symbols are unconstitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- suppose a city erected a cross not for purposes of memorializing the war dead or -- but just to emphasize the values of Christianity.   Would -- would that be proselytizing, or would that not be proselytizing? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " I think, again, that stays very close to the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy put in the Allegheny County dissent where you've got a permanent Latin cross on top of City Hall. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   This one is not -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- on top of City Hall. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " This one is, you know, in a park. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Oh.   Well, then I think it's very much like Penn Ed.   If they've got other symbols there and they -- and they allow -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It's just a cross. This is -- they want to emphasize the values of Christianity, so they put up a cross. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " I think it would be a very rare case, or unless you were sort of conditioning access to government services, like the one on City Hall would certainly suggest, that that would either constitute de facto establishment or de facto coercion. And I don't think the other side can provide a real-world hypothetical involving a cross that could be misused for proselytizing purposes, which is why I think the endorsement standard is -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I guess what -- what -- what I was trying to suggest was that this was something that indicated that the city was aligning itself with one particular religion.   We're putting up a cross.   We're not putting up any other religious symbols because we believe in the values that the cross indicates. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Again -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But it's -- it's not on top of City Hall.   It's on a street.   It's in a park. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Maybe there are two crosses.   Maybe there could be 10 crosses, you know, in different parts of the city. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But that's why the -- the -- the city is doing it.   And, of course, everybody recognizes what a cross is. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Right.   It's a relatively straightforward inquiry, Justice Kagan.   Is the religion of it a non-proselytizing purpose that -- that could be concerned. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, is there? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Again, in these circumstances, I need to know was this, for example, suggested by people who were honoring the victims of a school shooting.   Was it simply -- what was the genesis? You need to look at -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It's just a -- it's just a cross.   It really is.   So it's -- it's -- it's -- you know, these values are important to this community, the values of Christianity, so we would like to put up some crosses around town. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Oh, again, if that's the -- if that's the announced purpose and effect, of aligning ourselves with Christianity, then I would think it would sound -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, suppose -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- much like proselytizing. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- suppose after this case Hyattsville puts up a cross and College Park puts up a cross and the surrounding communities put up crosses, and they -- there's mixed purposes.   Some people do it because they want to support it because they want to celebrate Christianity.   Some people do it because they say we want to celebrate war dead.   There's mixed purposes.   Proselytizing or not proselytizing? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Again, I think sectarian symbols are presumptively valid, Justice Kavanaugh, because -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Presumptively valid and can -- that presumption can be overcome when? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I was just going to say you start out with what you -- you advertise is a pretty concise test, but it degenerates pretty quickly into, well, I need to know about this, I need to know about that, and becomes kind of a fact-specific test rather than the -- the -- the crisper one that you propose in your brief. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Your Honor, we could have a bright line test that only formal coercion is prohibited, but I don't think that would satisfy this Court because the dangers of the Establishment Clause posed by coercion, which is tangible threat to liberty, may -- could be reached indirectly through the sorts of things I'm talking about. And it is true, of course, that every test that this Court adopts needs to focus on context, purpose, and effect.   But the key point is you're asking a different question than you are under the endorsement test. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, I don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A.

Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- is -- what's the difference between saying I endorse something and I proselytize or promote, perhaps, is another synonym, something? It seems to me that you are taking us right back to the dog's breakfast you've warned us against.   And I do understand the coercion test, but I -- I -- I don't understand your abandonment of it. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Fair enough.   \"In God we trust\" certainly promotes religion, endorses religion, no question about it.   But it's not a -- it's not an effort to proselytize. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Justice Scalia once -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " The free exercise -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- Justice Scalia once asked a question when somebody gave that example.   He said, what -- what would happen if a coin had said \"In Jesus Christ we trust\"? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " And, again, that's actually a very nice illustration of the distinction.   On day one, we've got \"In God we trust,\" which is promoting, endorsing religion. It is no good under the Lemon test.   On day two, we've got \"In Jesus we trust.\" What message is the government sending? You can't trust this Jewish God. You've got to -- you've got to take sides in a sectarian dispute where Jesus is the one we're doing.   And if they are taking sides in a sectarian dispute, as Justice Scalia pointed out, that's precisely the definition of what constitutes an establishment.   To -- to -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Why am I not proselytizing religion when I say \"In God we trust\" but I am when I say \"In Jesus Christ we trust\"? I'm just proselytizing religion in a more generic sense. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A.

If it was Las Cruces, New Mexico, and again there was a legitimate non-proselytizing reason for the permanent cross, then -- but, as a general matter, sure, if they're putting up crosses at every courtroom, every DMV window, and all the parade of hypotheticals we've gotten on the other side, I can certainly understand why somebody would believe that they're trying to convert you to Christianity. After all, the hallmark of the establishment in Professor McConnell's article, which we're largely relying on, is seeking to inculcate a certain religious belief, a certain sectarian belief.   Now -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but if you look at his -- of course, you have.   His brief highlights six things -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A.

Both of the opinions we rely on, Town of Greece and Allegheny County, go a bit further, and they say in the real world, we want to make sure we're not creating the same dangers when the government is trying to create indirectly what it couldn't do directly. Again, this will be a rare exception, and they can't provide a real-world hypothetical.

But the second point I'd make is I understand Town of Greece and the Allegheny County dissent to say you either trace a practice back to the founding or you look to see whether it's akin to the kind of acknowledgments that the founders and the early generation thought were permissible, and you ask whether it presents any greater dangers than that.

And a locality, a state can decide to use it for that meaning. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, it is the foremost symbol of Christianity, isn't it? It invokes the central theological claim of Christianity, that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for humanity's sins and that he rose from the dead.   This is why Christians use crosses as a way to memorialize the dead. Is it because it connects to that central theological belief, isn't that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " So I'm not going to dispute that, obviously, it's the preeminent symbol of Christianity.   I believe all of the members of the plurality in Buono believe that too. The question is whether it's also taken on a secular meaning, because to say the cross has only that religious meaning I think would condemn every cross in the public sphere, including the ones that sit in Arlington, which even Respondents say we don't have to take down.

But what I would say is we have four basic buckets of litigation over displays in the state and federal courts.

I -- I -- I don't think the reasoning here is specific just to the cross bucket, though I do think it would take care of the vast bulk of -- of war memorials that are being litigated. I think the -- the logic of Town of Greece that we're urging the Court just to apply in this related context is, do any of those present greater dangers than the acknowledgments of religion in the public sphere that have existed since the founding?

And the Commission is arguing essentially that its cross does not violate the central command of the Establishment Clause because it's essentially a non-religious, non-Christian symbol that honors everyone, irrespective of their religion. Yet, I don't think anyone here would deny that it would be unconstitutional and inappropriate to go into Arlington and place a Latin cross over the grave of every person there, every fallen soldier, irrespective of their religion. In fact, in 1924, everyone in the congressional debate about the overseas markers was in agreement that it would be completely inappropriate and even sacrilegious to put a cross over the burial of a Jewish fallen soldier. But the Commission is here arguing today, as well as the other Petitioners, that it is, you know, telling Jews, telling Muslims, telling humanists that the cross honors them, when they emphatically say it does not. And it's telling Christians that their most preeminent and -- and sacred symbol of Jesus Christ actually, in fact, also symbolizes atheism. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, that -- that raises for me -- that -- that answer raises for me a question about standing. Is it too loud? Is the Star of David too loud? Is it too offensive? There aren't many places in the law where we allow someone to make a federal case out of their offensiveness about a symbol being too loud for them.   We accept that people have to sometimes live in a world in which other people's speech offend them.   We have to tolerate one another. This is the only area I can think of like that where we allow people to sue over an offense because, for them, it is too loud.   And we get into, as a result, having to dictate taste with respect to displays. We have a Ten Commandments display just above you, which may be too loud for many. Why shouldn't we apply our normal standing rules and require more than mere offense to make a federal case out of these? "}, {"speaker": "Monica L. Miller", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   Well, I don't think that it's mere offense.   It's -- it's about being a citizen in your own community.   And it's not private speech we're talking about.   We're talking about the government being the speaker and essentially giving you the message as the non-Christian in your community that you are a lesser citizen. And I think if you look at our record and -- and the letters that were sent to the Commission by self-proclaimed Christians that were outraged by the notion that their cross must have to be, you know, removed, you see that monuments like this sort of contribute to the idea that non-Christians are inferior.   You know, we are Christians.   We can put a cross wherever we want to. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, just to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's question, what if you had one letter from one person who purported to be offended by it? Would that be enough to support your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Monica L. Miller", "text": " Well -- well, no, Your Honor.   I think -- I think it would have to be that you are a member of the community, that you've witnessed the -- you've had the encounter -- I mean, there's no -- you know, Valley Forge says that you can't be someone in another state that read about it in a newspaper.   You have to be personally affected by the message. And if you are a citizen in a community, you are usually, you know, within the zone of interest of someone that would take offense or feel marginalized by the display. And, here, all of the -- all of the plaintiffs are individuals who are non-Christian, who say that when they encounter the government's symbol saying, you know, that Christians have valor, Christians have courage, Christians have devotion, Christians have endurance, those words on the base, that says something to them. And I think, you know, when you look back at the record in the 1920s, you know, Jews were fighting immense discrimination.   A lot of them joined the war, you know, to combat the stigma that they were considered cowards.

When you go into a World War I battlefield, there are Stars of David there, but because those battlefields were just rows and rows and rows of crosses, the cross became, in people's minds, the preeminent symbol of how to memorialize World War I dead.

The ones in Baltimore, for instance, one has Jesus Christ written on it, so that says to us at the same time Bladensburg cross was being put up, other World War I memorials were being put up in direct recognition of Jesus Christ.   That was the understanding at the time.   These are Christian symbols. Again, their -- the government's argument in this case is not that this is a Christian symbol anymore but that it, in fact, represents Jews and atheists and Muslims.

One is, again, the exaggeration that's going on on the record that there's somehow 50 or hundreds -- we've gotten all sorts of numbers -- of crosses that are on public land. They -- they cite, for instance, 50 examples of something that's not a cross.   What -- it's a boot with a rifle and a helmet.   And it's cited in the Respondent's -- or the Petitioner's reply brief, the -- the Commission's reply brief, I think at page 17, they refer to a cross in Lewisville, North Carolina.   It's not a cross.   They cite about 50 examples of that. They cite crosses in -- on private land.   I counted about 15 amongst the amicus briefs on private land.   So I'd say there's something closer to about 10, maybe 20, not as inclusive of -- of crosses that are quite small. With respect to history, there are a lot of reasons why religious minorities in -- in Christian-dominated societies would not feel safe challenging an actively used war memorial that is the town's most prominent symbol. You know, my clients have been threatened.   I've received death threats.   And I bet you it was not safer 90 years ago than it was -- it is today. Also, I don't think that you can say that this is just some sort of passive display that people don't take note of.   Like I said, if you look in the record, look at the letters that people -- how people are processing a monument like this, sort of like a billboard.

When it's displayed in isolation or is for one denomination, I think Justice Scalia had a lot of good points about this in his McCreary dissent about how he perceived the Ten Commandments as being for -- embraced by Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, but, for instance, if it was just the Christian version, which I'm not sure what that looks like, but assuming such could be the case, that might be a problem.

It's pursuant to this, like I said, statute that allows anyone to put them up.   So the factors relate to how much government support is there. When you see it in the -- you know, the size of it can matter insofar as it says how enthusiastic the city is about it. If you had a 90-foot cross and a two-foot Star of David, it says we really like Christians, we're okay with -- with Jews, you know, and so I think the size, the placement of it, obviously, in the most prominent parcel of land, the more prominent it is, the more it begs the question why is it there?

Miller", "text": " Oh, then the answer is no, I don't think that that's relevant at all. I mean, the Establishment Clause is -- you know, trumps statutes and -- and so forth.   So I think that would be -- yes. So we ask that this Court affirm. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Katyal. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Thank you. Ours is a middle path between my three excellent friends.   The easiest way to resolve this case in the -- is to say, in the wake of World War I, crosses like this one have an independent secular meaning. As Justice Kavanaugh said before, this Court's decisions recognize that symbols, including religious symbols, have dual meanings, and you can look to Van Orden for that or you could just look up.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But does -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Katyal, how -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- the cross really have a dual meaning, Mr. Katyal? It is the preeminent symbol of Christianity.   People wear crosses as -- to show their devotion to the Christian faith. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " We don't disagree with any of that, Justice Ginsburg.   Our only point -- it's the same one that the Buono plurality made -- is that crosses, particularly World War I ones, have a -- have a second meaning, and that meaning is what makes it constitutional. That's why we disagree with my friends here, because we think that their approach would -- what -- would risk the destruction of this 93-year-old memorial, which, you know -- which -- which has that real long tradition going back to the Field of Flanders -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Katyal -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- and the like.

What position are you taking -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " We profound -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- on behalf of the commission -- of -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " We profoundly disagree. We think it's unnecessary and unwise.   It's unnecessary because, as their own briefs say -- the best evidence of this is the last pages of each of the briefs by solicitor general and the Legion.   They say the existing tests make this an easy case to save the cross.   So it's not presented here. If, Justice Gorsuch, you're concerned about Lemon, wait for a case in which it has some bite.   Here, every test, whatever test you apply -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- yields the same result. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- you're -- you're -- you're in the same boat, though, saying apply Lemon -- keep Lemon, keep it -- keep it around for a rainy day, but please, please, please, do not apply Lemon to this case.

We just think this Court in Van Orden has said you didn't -- for passive monuments, which aren't necessarily -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What if we think -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- the most important ones -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

So I -- I'd appreciate an answer to that question.

But we think you'd have to do so much work to get there, Justice Kavanaugh, that it would be a distortion of Lemon.   And my friends say that there are, you know, disagreements in the lower courts.   Our cert petition outlines the disagreements in the lower courts.   They're largely on crosses. Our test resolves that.   It resolves the objective observer disputes and resolves the longetivity question of which there's a circuit split.   But to take this case and go further, particularly because, you know, as the Chief Justice said, they're selling you some clean test, but in the end, when -- you know, when push comes to shove, they have indirect coercion, proselytization, you know, and all these other things.   Who knows what those mean. The one thing we do know it means is that it's going to permit crosses like the Lake County cross with Jesus nailed to the center of it in public parks.   And that, to me, is a radical change in the law. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
