[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 21-846, Cruz versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2005, John Cruz was sentenced to death.   The judge instructed jurors that, without a death sentence, Cruz would face \"life imprisonment with a possibility of parole.\" The judge did so despite this Court's decision 11 years earlier in Simmons.   Cruz's jury labored under a seriously wrong idea.   Indeed, the jury foreman the very next day said: \"We wanted a reason to be lenient, and many of us would have rather voted for life, but we were not given an option to vote for life in prison without the possibility of parole.\" Cruz wasn't the only one.   Twelve separate times, 12 separate times, the Arizona Supreme Court wrote decisions refusing to apply Simmons.   In 2016, this Court summarily reversed all this in Lynch, fundamentally changing capital trials in Arizona.   Cruz then used Lynch to seek post-conviction relief under Arizona Rule 32.1(g).   Yet, the Arizona Supreme Court refused, saying Lynch didn't change the law; it just changed the application of the law. That interpretation of Rule 32 is not an adequate and independent state ground for three separate reasons.   First, to be adequate, an interpretation must be firmly established and regularly followed.   This hair-splitting distinction between changes in the law and applications of the law is entirely novel, entirely hand-crafted.   The state doesn't even defend it. Second, the decision below discriminates against federal rights.   It places defendants like Cruz in a catch-22.   To prevail under federal law, they have to argue that Lynch applied a settled rule, but that very argument dooms their claims under state law.   It also discriminates against decisions of this Court by giving them narrower effect.   And, finally, the decision below is not independent; it's interwoven with federal questions. The Arizona Supreme Court's analysis of Rule 32 turned on its reading of this Court's precedents.   Simmons was the law of the land in 49 states, all except Arizona.   Arizona is an extreme outlier, and for that reason today, it stands alone in this Court.   None of the other 49 states, not a single one, is supporting them. If I could start with the first point about novelty. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, let's just talk about what we're considering.   I understand Simmons and Lynch, but what I understand the Arizona Supreme Court to be saying, it does not -- under our rules, there's nothing more here, that they simply interpreted their Rule 32.   How do we get from that interpretation of their rule to a federal question -- federal issue? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Right.   Each of these three arguments, Justice Thomas, are things this Court has used before to get to the federal issue.   So, first, with respect to novelty, if a state enacts a procedural rule that is only about state law, but it is a barrier to federal claims or is novel in some way, this Court time and again, starting with Justice Holmes in 1904, going to this Court's much more recent decisions, have said that it's got to be firmly established and regularly followed. And that's so for two reasons.   One is, if it's a novel rule, it might be discriminating against federal rights, and that's a tell.   The other is that you have to provide fair warning to the defendant.   And the case law talks about both.   And in case after case, Your Honor, this Court has done exactly that on novelty.   So that's the first point. The second is the other way -- the second way you get to a federal issue is that this Court polices, indeed, the Court in Walker said it's regularly said that if an interpretation discriminates against a federal right, even if it's purely a matter of state law -- take, for example, this Court's decision just last year in Espinoza versus -- versus Montana. That was purely interpreting a state -- a state constitutional provision, but there was a federal question lurking under that.   And that is true here as well because of the discrimination. And then the third is that it's interwoven with federal law.   It's not actually a purely -- and I would fight the premise of your question -- a -- a state interpretation -- it's not just a state interpretation. And these are three separate arguments.   You can disagree with me on any one, but they have to run the table and win all three of them. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, you phrased this and present it, for understandable reasons, as hostility to a particular federal rule.   But you can also look at it as a neutral rule, a procedural rule.   I mean, the state doesn't have to provide collateral review of this particular claim, and they're -- they've decided they're not going to.   And you -- and that doesn't exhibit hostility.   It's just shaping the availability of collateral review, just as AEDPA does in the federal system. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Absolutely, Your Honor, it could be seen that way.   But, here, of course, this is a novel interpretation, and that alone, even apart from whether it discriminates or is neutral, that's enough to reject it under this Court's precedents.   And then, with respect to whether or not this is even-handed, we obviously don't think it is for the reasons our brief says, we agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that if it were truly a neutral rule that withdrew from the field, for example, all post-conviction review, that would be one thing. But, here, Arizona holds out Rule 31.2 and says to defendants like Cruz, if there's a significant change in the law, you can come and bring your post-conviction proceeding.   Cruz did exactly that, and now it becomes a shell game because then they say, oh, that rule was so clearly established that it didn't -- it's not actually a significant change in the law. That's, of course, the opposite of what the Arizona Supreme Court did in Cruz's very case back in 2008.   In 2008, when Cruz brought this, they said -- they -- the -- they said the reverse.   And so, you know, the Arizona Supreme Court has been essentially talking out of both sides of its mouth. You said in Simmons this is the rule of the land.   Cruz was convicted after Simmons. You said it again in Lynch after the Arizona Supreme Court in 12 published opinions refused to apply Simmons.   And now the Arizona Supreme Court turns around and says, oh, because it's so clearly established, now you can't have a 31.2 petition.   And that's pulling -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. -- Mr. Katyal, you -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- the chair -- chair out from under the -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Oh, I'm sorry.   You -- you began with three points, and if I remember correctly, the first two require us to analyze the opinions of the Arizona Supreme Court as to whether it's novel and -- and I -- but -- but assume that it was always the rule in Arizona that a significant change in the law, whether federal or state, would be covered and that a significant change in the law is different from a significantly new application of the law. Okay.   Suppose that was always the rule.   Then what would be -- what's -- what is left of your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I -- it would be hard for me to understand exactly what they had said before.   I can tell you what the Arizona Supreme Court actually has said before if you look at a case like Rendon, because in Rendon, what the Arizona Supreme Court said -- and this is true in many different cases -- they say the archetype of a significant change in the rule -- in the law is overturning of precedent. And, in Rendon, that's what happened.   They -- they overturned an intermediate Arizona Supreme Court precedent.   This was just on one thing, the definition of burglary. And what that court said, the Arizona Supreme Court said is, ha, that is something that allows a 31.2(g) petition, and they said this even though \"it is not a new rule but rather a corrected definition of the crime.\" "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, as I said, you have arguments that require us to analyze what they've done.   And I've looked at that.   We will look at it again. But assuming for the sake of argument, this is a hypothetical, that the rule has always been what the Arizona Supreme Court now says the rule is, what is your remaining argument? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Yeah.   So -- so that would make it -- take away the novelty because that would be firmly established, regularly followed, assuming that that's part of -- built into your hypothetical -- it wasn't, but we can assume that -- it would still discriminate, I think, in practice and operation against federal rights.   And what this Court said in Walker is that's the test, not whether it's neutrally written or -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I meant to make that part of my hypothetical too.   So they say that -- that there's no discrimination.   We treat changes in federal law the same way we change -- we treat changes in state law. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " It's almost impossible, Your Honor, to imagine that hypothetical because, you know, like, basically, you know, how can a decision be dictated by Arizona Supreme Court precedent if a decision is overruling Arizona Supreme Court precedent. I mean, the way in which the court below got to what it did is it said at Petition Appendix page 7A that when we overturn precedent that's generally the archetype of a significant change in law. And then they said, well, it's not a significant change in law because Lynch was always the law of the land.   It didn't change anything.   Simmons was always the law of the land. That -- I think that rationale could only apply to decisions of this Court.   I think it's a decision handmade, you know, jerry-rigged, to use Justice Kagan's word from the last argument, only for really a circumstance like this in which the U.S. Supreme Court is overturning something. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Katyal -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " So I just don't think it could be written neutrally. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- I -- I thought I had understood you to respond to the Chief Justice before your colloquy with Justice Alito that if there were an independent and adequate state ground, if they had such a rule, then it would be barred.   Is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " If -- if there were -- what -- what's the -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " If the State of Arizona had an independent and adequate rule that it's consistently followed, then -- then your claim would be barred?

There, they found that there was -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But it's plausible that it could be procedurally barred. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " In -- in federal habeas court, maybe there's a federal habeas barrier. We don't think that there is for reasons our brief explains -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well -- well -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- but -- but -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- but 2244 speaks of requiring a decision of this Court to be declared retroactive by this Court. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, we're -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And the district court found that there was no such decision in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " But, Justice Gorsuch, the district court is a totally separate proceeding. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I understand that. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Here, your grant of certiorari -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I guess I'm just wondering how we can fault Arizona for having a rule -- if it were consistently followed that would effectively parallel the federal rule. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, Justice Gorsuch, I don't think that whatever is going on in the federal habeas bears on the jurisdiction of this Court under 1257.   They're two separate proceedings. And to answer the question presented, which is simply whether or not there is an adequate and independent state ground from the petition of the -- from the -- from the Arizona Supreme Court, I don't think matters to federal habeas. With respect to that, look, we don't doubt that there could be waiver arguments that are available even from direct -- even from review of a state's post-collateral review proceeding.   We're not questioning any of that. What we're saying here is that Cruz did everything right.   He preserved his argument at every turn, starting from when he was -- starting from trial and when he was convicted and then for -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, what do we do about that actually? I -- that -- that raises another point in my mind, which is the trial court, admittedly not the Arizona Supreme Court, but the trial court here did find that your client failed to present a jury instruction along these lines to preserve this argument. And so even if we were to find for you and say there was no independent and adequate state bar, all we'd be doing is sending it back to the Arizona Supreme Court to find that he waived the argument in the first place and we've accomplished very little, if at all "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, that -- that was just wrong under this Court's decisions in Simmons and in Lynch.   So, in Simmons, it applied -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But we wouldn't be able to review that.   That would just be a waiver under state law, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Oh -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- if the Arizona Supreme Court were to affirm it -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- you think it's wrong and you could appeal, I understand, but that would be all state law, right? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " No, Justice Gorsuch. That's exactly a federal question.   This Court in Simmons and in Lynch said -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Waiver is a federal question? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, they -- the -- what -- the reason that they're claiming waiver, which is you didn't seek a jury instruction -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- here, Cruz sought to present evidence about his parole ineligibility, and at pages 163 to 167 of the plurality in Simmons and at 175 to 179 of Justice O'Connor's concurrence, it says either suffices, seeking evidence of parole ineligibility or a jury instruction.   It definitely can't be the case that you couldn't or a federal court couldn't review that.   That is a purely federal matter. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Last question, I hope.   In Beard, Justice Kennedy said that when we -- when we approach the question of the consistency of state courts' decision-making in this area, adequate -- interpreting their own laws, their own procedural rules, 32.1, whatever it is, we have to give those state supreme courts some leeway to develop their own jurisprudence that we would expect to allow ourselves and other federal courts. What's your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " We -- we absolutely agree with all of that, Justice Gorsuch.   The test has always been -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So we should take that as a given? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- firmly established, regularly followed.   That's what Justice Kennedy says in that case.   That's what their own brief in opposition admits at page 11 is the standard. There is no way you can get to regularly followed and firmly established, this application of the law concept.   That's entirely hair splitting. And if you want to note just how hair splitting it is, because you mentioned the trial court proceedings, look at what these prosecutors said to the trial court.   This is Joint -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But I -- I -- I -- I just -- on my question, I just -- you agree with Justice Kennedy in Beard? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " I mean, so you could -- you know, so as long as it's predictable, provides fair warning and firmly established, absolutely.   This is the opposite. This is what the prosecutor said at Joint Appendix page 307: \"Lynch overruled a well-established line of Arizona Supreme Court opinions\" holding Simmons did not apply in Arizona.   It was an unambiguous rule that the defendants were not entitled to Simmons instructions. That's what they said then.   Take a look at now what they're saying at red brief, page 1.   They say the exact opposite.   They say Simmons was well-established. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Can I ask you, how much of your -- the -- the firmly established and regularly followed principle relies on bad faith by Arizona? Does it -- does it matter? You know, you say novelty is one thing and you define it in this way, and then discrimination, the result is unfair.   Does any of that turn on Arizona doing this on purpose? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " No, no, not at all.   So it's purely about whether it's regularly established and firmly -- firmly established and regularly followed. And the reason for that is it's kind of almost like, you know, other doctrines in law in which you're using it as a tell.   You can't actually figure out motivations.   You're not worried about that. You just simply ask, is there fair warning for the defendant? Is this a predictable rule? This is the very opposite of a predictable rule, and, indeed, it's so unpredictable that after the prosecutor said this in the trial court, the trial court on post-conviction review said, quote, and this is at Petition Appendix 15A, \"The rule announced in Simmons and Lynch is not a well-established constitutional principle.\" The Arizona Supreme Court's consistently held otherwise in at least nine separate opinions.   So this is essentially -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Katyal, I thought -- I thought -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I -- I thought that -- that why they were doing this was important.   Whether we're looking for hostility or just finality is kind of the question. And Justice Kennedy in Beard said that what we should be looking for is a showing of a purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees.   I thought you agreed with that. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Oh, he certainly does -- so that's essentially gravy, Justice Gorsuch. So we don't need to show hostility.   That's what he's saying is one way in which you can show that the novelty doctrine is enough.   But it is certainly not the only means. And I think going all the way back to Justice Holmes' opinion in Rogers in 1904 all the way through all of the different cases, sure, some of them, like the NAACP cases, do talk about hostility, but it has never been a requirement, and for one very simple reason, half of the novelty doctrine is based on fair warning to the defendant.   Another part is based on hostility to federal rights. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " And so -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Could you show a hostility in this case? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Oh, absolutely.   This is, I think, the quintessential example, Justice Kagan.   Again, doesn't turn on it.   It's sufficient but not necessary. And so, if you think about just what the Arizona Supreme Court did here and, you know, Cruz brings his direct review petition, they say Simmons doesn't apply in 2008.   Twelve separate defendants bring their cases, all of them, they say Simmons doesn't apply. This Court then summarily reverses that in Lynch in 2016, so then now they've said twice, hey, Simmons does apply, this rule does apply, and then the Arizona Supreme Court turns on a dime and says, oh, actually, Simmons has been the law all along, the exact opposite of what they've been saying, the exact opposite of what even the trial court on post-conviction review in this case said.   This is a very unusual case, which is why I suspect Arizona stands alone in this Court. And to be sure, there are broader arguments we're making about discrimination in federal law and so on.   We don't think you have to reach any of that. We think you can just simply say this is a jerry-rigged interpretation for this case only.   There's not -- the opposite of regularly followed and firmly established and leave it at that. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Katyal, whether Arizona stands alone or not doesn't have much to do with the question that we have to decide. But why would we expect other states to file in a case that involves the kind of stuff that you've been talking about the interpretation of a -- one particular state procedural rule? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Well, because my friend on the other side says, if you do this, it's going to open federal court review to other states and things like that. And our only point here is to just simply say, you know, no other state's worried about it because I think this is a really unique fact pattern.   There are 27 states that have the death penalty.   Nothing about that.   Sixteen states have -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   Well, I -- I don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " -- parole ineligibility. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- if it's a really unique fact pattern, then I don't know what -- whether -- why it matters whether other states are here or not. To get back to the question I was trying to address in my prior question, suppose Arizona says or any state says that we will limit this form of collateral review to situations in which we, in our judgment, believe that there has been a significant change in the law, including federal law.   So it's solely their judgment as to whether there's been a significant change or not.   Is there anything wrong with that? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " I think there could be under this Court's precedents in Danforth and Yates.   We don't think you have to get there, but I think those cases do set forth a minimum amount -- a minimum floor of retroactivity.   And if the state post-conviction review proceeding isn't open to them, to certain federal claims, then I think it could present a problem under this Court's decisions. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So this is your argument about independence? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " It's an argument -- I think it would probably be more about adequacy, Justice Alito, that basically the state is not offering an adequate ground because that -- that forum is only open to certain claims. Now, again, our point is you don't need to have post-conviction review, but if you do so, it's got to be even-handed.   It's got to be done in advance with notice for a defendant. Someone like Cruz did everything right, making his objection at the trial, making it at sentencing, making it after sentencing on direct review, filing his post-conviction review proceeding soon after this Court's decision in Lynch.   And yet they turn on a dime and say, oh, no, now there's a new interpretation of 32.1. And I think you should, if you might, ask my friend on the other side, name one precedent ever when the Arizona Supreme Court, indeed, any court in Arizona, said 31.2(g) is not met when precedent has been overturned. They can't point to a single example. We point to many the other way, including most prominently the Rendon decision.   And so -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Katyal, before your time, your regular time is up, why isn't the situation that I posited the same as the situation in Stewart versus Smith?

Justice Alito? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Just one question, Mr. Katyal.   I think underlying some of Justice Alito's questions and Justice Gorsuch's questions was a view, not a belief, that the Arizona Supreme Court interpretation of Rule 32.1(g) isn't completely novel interpretation but only a reasonable extension of that court's Rule 32.1(g) jurisprudence to a new context. Why do you think that's wrong? "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Because it's literally the opposite of the rule that's been applied in cases like Rendon, in which they say overturning precedent is the archetypal example of a significant change in law.   This idea that there's -- that application of the law is somehow the distinction, whatever that is, it's not regularly followed.   It's certainly not firmly established. This rule, 31.2(g), has been around for decades.   Not a single court has ever interpreted it this way.   And it has been the time-honored rule, Justice Sotomayor, of this Court, starting with Justice Holmes in 1904 but going to Ward versus Board, going to Patterson, going to Flowers, going to Bouie, going to Ford versus Georgia, in which Justice Thomas was on that unanimous decision.   All of these cases are ones in which this Court says that's a novel interpretation, you can't do it.   Maybe going forward you can, but certainly not to people like Cruz, and we know it made a difference in this case.

"}, {"speaker": "Joseph A. Kanefield", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On May 26, 2003, the Petitioner murdered Tucson Police Officer Patrick Hardesty in the line of duty by shooting him five times at point-blank range.   He comes here today on appeal of a successive state post-conviction judgment to obtain a new penalty phase so that he can request the parole ineligibility instructions under Simmons v. South Carolina, a case which predated his trial by over a decade. The Arizona Supreme Court's holding that Rule 32.1(g) precludes Petitioner's request for successive post-conviction relief is grounded in the core principle of finality and is adequate and an independent state ground for its judgment. The holding is adequate because Rule 32.1(g) has been firmly established and regularly followed.   Under the rule, Arizona's indisputable interest in finality of criminal convictions can only yield to a claim based on those rare decisions announcing a new rule of law or a significant statutory or constitutional amendment.   Here, Petitioner did not make that showing. This Court's 2016 decision in Lynch did not change the Simmons right.   Instead, it merely corrected the Arizona Supreme Court's erroneous application of the Simmons rule in the unique context of Arizona's sentencing and parole statutes.   Thus, the Arizona Supreme Court held that Lynch was not a significant change in the law under the rule, which is a state law holding. The Arizona Supreme Court's holding is also independent because its significant change analysis under the first prong of Rule 32.1(g) does not require any determination on the merits of Petitioner's federal law claim.   This Court looked only to whether Lynch significantly changed existing law, which is a state procedural question. For these reasons, this Court should find that the Arizona Supreme Court's ruling was adequate and independent. I welcome the Court's questions.

But I wonder whether this isn't a place where the bad faith part of it comes in, that to the extent that you would have otherwise had a presumption that you needed some time to work out your interpretation of this rule, in this very unique situation, why shouldn't we say you don't really get that presumption because your friend on the other side says 12 times the court told you what the law was and you refused to apply it?

So then Ring comes out and now Arizona now has to apply Ring.   Juries are going to make the -- the aggravator determination.   So the first time that the issue came up was actually in this case itself.   So this is -- now we're in -- the crime was committed in 2003.   His trial was in 2005. So the Arizona Supreme Court's trying to figure out how the -- the -- the Simmons claim applies here.   It -- it was not properly presented below.   I'd respectfully disagree with my friend -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " So why doesn't that undermine your claim then? I thought you were saying ultimately that the reason why this is not a -- a significant change is because this was the way the law always was and so that's how our rule -- why our 32(g) now bars him. But you're suggesting with this part of the story that Arizona wasn't really sure of what the law was before, that they can't now say, oh, it was so settled that you don't get the benefit of collateral review because they hadn't really sorted it out early on. "}, {"speaker": "Joseph A. Kanefield", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, I understand the question, but the -- the -- I mean, the Simmons rule is -- is clear.   I mean, the holding is clear that if the future dangerousness is at issue, then the defendant can ask for a parole ineligibility instruction through either instruction or argument. What was unclear was whether parole was unavailable in Arizona.   It -- because the problem was the -- in the criminal sentencing statutes, these are the statutes that the judges and the -- and the prosecutors and the defense counsel are looking at, it said at the time that there were three options.   There was either -- there was either the death penalty, there was a natural life sentence, or there was life with the possibility of release or parole after 25 years.   It said that. The -- the issue was in a separate title, Title 41, the administrative section for how parole is actually undertaken by the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency, the legislature -- the Arizona legislature flipped off the switch. So it's not even clear to us if -- if -- if anyone was necessarily even aware of that early on in the case. So -- and then -- and then take -- you have to remember, in Simmons, and -- and -- and as I read this before, this Court, you know, very clearly said that the state law has to prohibit the defendant's release on parole, so -- it didn't, though.   It had that -- that -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " I see.   So you're not at fault.   It was confusing.   You didn't really know.

They allow for a successive PCR to occur, and in that rare situation -- and I'm quoting Justice Hurwitz's majority opinion in the Shrum case -- it's got to be a rare situation where the underlying rule of law has changed. It's not going to happen very often, so it doesn't mean just because it -- it doesn't happen very often or it has to be this -- this -- the way -- the context in which it's come up here, that it's -- that it's somehow inadequate.

You know, first, you didn't apply Lynch -- excuse me, not applying, you know, Simmons or Lynch.   You know, first, you don't apply Simmons.   We come in.   We summarily reverse you.   We say, you know, here's -- here's the deal.   Simmons applies.   That's what we say in Lynch. Then you contort your procedural rule to say, oh, well, you know, there's a difference between changes in law and changes in application in law.   And then, in this case, you're still saying, like, Lynch is wrongly decided.   Simmons is wrongly decided.   We can't really -- we just really hate all this stuff. It sounds like you're thumbing your nose at us. "}, {"speaker": "Joseph A. Kanefield", "text": " Justice Kagan, absolutely no disrespect was intended by that footnote to the Court, and I apologize if that's the way it -- it came across. I -- I think the state -- we've -- we were surprised by the Lynch ruling, I think because of the fact that this Court had to get in -- a little bit into the weeds of Arizona, interpreting Arizona statutes, even though it was in the context of applying the Simmons rule. And I think this may be a remnant of that, of -- of that confusion. But understand we absolutely respect the Lynch decision and the Arizona Supreme Court has applied it.   But we don't think that that implies any kind of bad faith or any effort to deprive a defendant, this defendant, of his ability to exercise his federal rights. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   You said in response to a question that Arizona courts may not deny federal rights. You correctly answered yes. "}, {"speaker": "Joseph A.

Kanefield", "text": " -- it has to be -- it has to be across the board.   I mean, obviously, we wholeheartedly agree that the Arizona Supreme Court cannot promulgate a PCR rule in -- in a way that treats the precedent from this Court any different from the precedent of its own court. And so I think the -- the -- the Petitioner is incorrect to read the way this Court -- the Arizona Supreme Court applied its rule in this context to -- to be -- to mean any kind of disrespect or any kind of mistreatment. It just found itself in a very unique situation with the -- with the summary reversal in Lynch. And -- and so I hope I answered your question. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " I thought that the point of the Chief's question -- maybe I -- I didn't understand it -- was -- concerns the -- the distinction between your obligation to apply federal retroactivity rules if you -- at least federal retroactivity rules if you entertain the claim.   If you entertained this claim, you couldn't apply a retroactivity rule different from the federal retroactivity rule. But you say that we don't have to entertain it at all because of a procedural rule that categorizes claims in a way that we choose to adopt, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Joseph A.

So the Arizona Supreme Court never got past one.   It has to be a significant change.   It has to apply.   And that's where the retroactivity question would -- would -- would ordinarily be addressed. And then it has to probably change the outcome.   So even if we get past significance, there's a very real possibility that -- that Mr. Cruz will not survive the other components of that rule.

"}, {"speaker": "Joseph A. Kanefield", "text": " That's what the Court, you know, essentially addressed in -- in Walker versus Martin.   And we see some parallels because there, the -- the -- there was a note, the time to bring habeas in California was without substantial delay, so the Court had to wrestle with what was substantial and what was insubstantial, and there was arguments that it wasn't being applied in a -- in a -- in a uniform way.   We see a lot of parallels to the significance and insignificance distinction in Rule 32.1(g).   So the court has to be given the opportunity to flesh that out in -- in -- in case -- on a case-by-case determination. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan? No? Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Katyal. "}, {"speaker": "Neal Kumar Katyal", "text": " Thank you.   Four points. First, my friend began by -- began his argument by admitting that there's \"no example\" of what Justice Barrett called a hair-splitting application and interpretation.   He later conceded this was the \"first time\" this interpretation of Rule 32.1 had ever been given. That is the opposite of regularly followed and firmly established every day of the week. Rule 32 has been around for decades. It's never once been interpreted this way.   It's always been interpreted as overturning precedent.   And you don't need to speculate about this because the Arizona Supreme Court in Rendon had a very similar circumstance, except it involved state law.   That was a burglary statute.   The law had always stayed the same. The statute always stayed the same.   What changed was the interpretation of the statute. That court found -- the Supreme -- Arizona Supreme Court said obvious significant change in the law. Lynch works the same way, as Justice Kagan said.   At point A, the law is one thing; at point B, it's another.   At point A, 12 different criminal defendants are -- their death sentences are affirmed.   At point B, they should now be reversed under this Court's decision in Lynch. Second, with respect to the question about Stewart versus Smith, Justice Alito, there's no novelty issue at all in that case, no discrimination against federal law issue in that case.   That was just about a procedural rule that just categorized a claim.   It wasn't about applying that law or applying that rule in any way to federal law, which is, I take it, why my friend never even mentioned it during his oral argument. Third, the jury instruction point that he made.   As I said to Justice Gorsuch, as a matter of federal law, it's wrong under Simmons and Lynch, and, also, it's wrong factually. Cruz cited Simmons by name in his trial, Joint Appendix page 54 and 55.   And, also, there's another cert petition pending with six more criminal defendants from Arizona raising the same issue, and his brief in opposition admits that two of them don't even have the jury instruction issue because they sought the jury instruction.   So I think this case is briefed and decided, ready to -- you've got the merits there. And, finally and most importantly, I want to pick up on what Justice Kagan said about the Kafkaesque rule here.   It is striking that they still have not explained why they are so resistant to giving Cruz his Simmon rights -- Simmons rights, rights that they now say he was always entitled to.   They're now calling them well-established, but they've been arguing the contrary for decades.   In the end, this is about one thing, making sure that Simmons rights aren't extended to Cruz and people like him, even though we know in this very case from the jury foreman it would have made a massive difference. I know this argument gets technical about all this stuff about application of rules and stuff, but here's what the state's saying. In plain English, they're saying that John Cruz should be put to death even though, in fact, because his claim was too good, that it was so powerful, that it was well-established at the time.   That is not something the Arizona Supreme Court has ever said anything like before.   It is the essence of novel.   It is the essence of discrimination against decisions of this Court.
