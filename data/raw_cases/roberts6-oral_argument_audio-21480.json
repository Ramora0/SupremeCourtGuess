[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " 09-1233, Schwarzenegger versus Plata, and the related cases, Mr. Phillips. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.   What this Court has under review today is an extraordinary and unprecedented order issued by a three-judge District Court, requiring the release of between 36,000 and 45,000 inmates, currently incarcerated in the California penal system within a two-year period.   The order in this particular case is made particularly remarkable because it strikes me that at a minimum it is extraordinarily premature.   That it may come at some point in this process that an order, probably substantially smaller in scope than this one, may become appropriate, but if this is supposed to be an order or remedy of last resort, and what the district court has done here is leapfrogged a series of steps that should have been taken ahead of going this particular route. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " One case, Mr. Phillips, is pending for 20 years, is that not so? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Yes that is correct, Justice Ginsburg. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So it seems to me -- and there were something like 70 orders from the district court, the single-judge district court in that case? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " That is absolutely true, Justice Ginsburg. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And no change, so how much longer do we have to wait, another 20 years? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " No, Justice Ginsburg.   I think, obviously, the length of time you have to wait in some ways depends on what the state of the remedial phase is in the particular case.   And in this case and in recognition, frankly, of the substantial problems that were inherent in the penal system as it existed during the 1990s and up until the early 2000s, a receiver was appointed, specifically in the Plata class, but there was also a connection between the receiver and the special master even in the Coleman class before the three-judge panel was convened.   And under those circumstances and given the extraordinary powers that the receiver had been accorded, what should have -- the most logical course if this is supposed to be a remedy of last resort was to allow the receiver an opportunity to implement the extraordinary powers that were conferred upon him, and then see, because if it turns out that we are making progress \u2013 "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Excuse me, could you tell me from your briefs, I just haven't understood what the alternative steps are?   The court below talked about some proposals like construction and said the legislature has struck them down.   There's -- the fiscal crisis has gotten worse, so construction is really not an option.   I don't see how you wait for an option that doesn't exist.   They talked about hiring more staff, but the conclusion was that even if you maximize the staff, you don't have the facilities to add more staff, which is what you need to cure the constitutional violation.   So tell me what specific steps outside of this order should have been given time to be implemented because the receiver has basically said, \u201cI've tried, and the small progress we made has been reversed because the population just keeps growing.   So we can never get ahead of the problem.\u201d   So slow down from the rhetoric and give me concrete \u2013 "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- details about what the least restrictive means would have been other than to say, throw it back to a receiver and special master who are saying, we don't have a solution outside of reducing overcrowding. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " -- I don't think that's a fair characterization of what the receiver said.   The receiver said that at any population he would in fact get you -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Oh, Counsel that was one statement years ago.   Is that is all you are relying on? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " --No, no.   That's not all I'm relying on.   All I'm suggesting -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That may be your weakest argument.   Tell me -- give me concrete steps that are least -- less restrictive. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well if you -- all you have to do is look at what the receiver has done over the course of the period of time since his appointment, and particularly when the second receiver was put in place.   First of all, A.B. 900 has been enacted.   There is significant construction.   There has been ground broken.   There are substantial facilities in place.   Second, the receiver has had extraordinary success in the hiring process.   We are at close to 90 percent -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Is there in fact less overcrowding because I thought what this case was all about was that the receiver has said, the special master has said, \u201cwe can't make any progress at all until there are fewer people; we have no place to put clinics.   The first step, not the last step, but given what we are dealing with here, the potential first step, is that we have fewer people so there is more room for these health facilities, more room for staff to operate.\u201d "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, the fundamental issue in this case seems to me as -- what is the real cause of the constitutional violation here?   And the real cause of the constitutional violation here has always been the culture of disregard for the inmates.   What the receiver was put in place for, the reason he was appointed, and properly so, this was with the State's consent, this is not over our objection, was to change that fundamental culture and to provide, one; construction, to provide increased numbers, to provide -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But he can't provide construction when the State doesn't supply the money for it? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Except that since the August 8, 2008, period of time, you know, literally hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to construction specifically and more than $4 billion have been spent on the provision of healthcare in this particular system and a great deal of that is because of the receiver. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Then if there are -- if there are these great changes in circumstances so that now they -- medical care can be administered in something approaching a decent way, you could go back to the single-judge district court and say I'm moving under 60(b); circumstances have changed, it is no longer the case that it's impossible to render decent health care. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, I don't think we could get that relief from the single-judge district court, unless you are asking me to actually seek to remove the entirety of the claim.   I mean, the order that says that we have to get to 137.5 percent of the design, the designed capacity within two years is a three-judge district court decision. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you go back to that panel because it invited you to. It said if circumstances change, come back. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Right, but that will always be the case, Justice Sotomayor.   The fundamental question here is, Congress shifted dramatically, the approach that you are supposed to take as a court of equity in this context, this is supposed to be a matter of last resort, which would mean that you would give the receiver a full opportunity to do what the receiver-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What the receiver said the best statement that seemed to me to summarize it.   It's in his brief on page 9.   He has about two paragraphs and as you read that two paragraphs, it sounds as if overcrowding is a big, big cause of this problem, which is horrendous, which if you think it's accurately described in the mental case in the first page, two paragraphs, if that's a fair description from the record, it's a horrendous problem. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What the receiver says is overcrowding is a big cause of it and then he says, \u201cI think we have discovered you actually can provide care, and certainly our plan and turnaround plan believes we can provide constitutional levels of care, no matter what the population is.\u201d   So then you look to the care and turnaround plan and it says, \u201cspend $8 billion building more buildings and then the legislature rejected it.\u201d   Okay?   Now, there we are.   More time, what's supposed to happen? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " No, but, Justice Breyer, the legislature also approved a smaller, but nevertheless multibillion-dollar construction program. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That was 2.31 or something like that. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, I \u2013 "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And did they approve the 2.3?   Is that in place, 2.35?   Did they approve that? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Yes, they did approve that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " -- and that money is being spent. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So he said, \u201cwe need eight, we need eight and they approved 2.35.\u201d "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Right, and the receiver -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Is there any evidence here that suggests that 2.35 is sufficient to cure the constitutional violation? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, I don't know whether it will get you there or not -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So I take it from your answer the answer is no, there is no evidence? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, there is the evidence that the receiver asked for contempt for not getting the 8 billion and withdrew that motion, so obviously there is some sense in which the receiver is reasonably satisfied with 2.35 billion as an opening gambit.   But again, all of this goes to what is, at least from my perspective, the fundamental question the court should have evaluated in the first instance, which is, are we ready yet to give up hope at this point? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, what he says -- what the receiver says about the 2.35, is that it is a significant step farther. It is certainly better than no construction at all.   However, that is not equivalent to a conclusion that that current compromise will result in sustainable constitutional healthcare at current population density levels.   That's what he said about it.   So we have his views and I'm back to my question, what else is supposed to happen, which was your question initially? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Justice Breyer, when the receiver says that, now remember he says at current population levels, he doesn't suggest, and his brief is very clear that it doesn't urge this Court to affirm the particular order in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr.-- "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Can I just finish this? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " And the reality is that the population levels have dropped pretty significantly since August, since the trial in this particular case and given the actions by the legislature in AB 18 and the actions of the legislature in AB 900, there are both a lot of expenditures on the table and substantial reductions in the population size, and so therefore, even under the receiver's -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Do we have information about that substantial reduction?   I mean, in this record, it just seems to be that it's -- no matter how many efforts have been made, the population goes up and now you say that the population has gone down; from what point in time and how much has it gone down? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, it's down to around, as I understand it, about 147,000 from a high of around 165 to 170,000, and it has dropped, as we know, because there has been a change in the good time credits.   There has been a significant number of transfers.   I mean, that was the purpose of the governor's proclamation (Voice Overlap). "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So it's possible that within the two-year period, you are going to hit the mark, if you -- that's what -- "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " I think it unlikely. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- that's what the three-judge panel said, which is if you implement most of the proposals being made, you are likely to hit the mark.   So what you are saying is you are going to do it and if you don't, they invited you to come back and -- you really don't think that if you hit 140 percentage, that the court is going to order an immediate release of the 2.5 percent over the limit it set?   It's going to ask you, \u201cWhat have you put into place to reach that level over what additional period of time?\u201d "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " There is a core sort of federalism answer and then a basic sort of factual point to be made here.   Let me make the second one first, and then I want to come back to the, what you may regard as rhetorical, but nevertheless I think important, which is that when we made our initial proposal to the three-judge court, suggesting what we thought would be a reasonable reduction within a reasonable period of time, it was met with both a motion for contempt and summary rejection out of hand, notwithstanding that there was improvement in both -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what are we fighting about? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Are we fighting about that the plan was wrong or are we fighting about that you are angry that you were told to do it in two years -- in 22 years, as opposed to do it in 25 years?   Is that -- is that what you're objecting to? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " No.   I think this -- this goes to the federalism point. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can you do it in 5 years? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " I don't know.   I -- you know, if -- balancing all of the policies that the State has to take into account, can it get there and is that in the best interest of the State of California, if it is, yes, then we can get there. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, the best interest of the State of California, isn't it to deliver adequate constitutional care to the people that it incarcerates?   That's a constitutional obligation. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Absolutely!   And California recognizes that. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So when are you going to get to that?   What are you going to avoid the needless deaths that were reported in this record?   When are you going to avoid or get around people sitting in their feces for days in a dazed state?   When are you going to get to a point where you are going to deliver care that is going to be adequate? "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But don't be rhetorical. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " I'll do my best.   Thank you, Your Honor. [Laughter]   I mean, first of all, if you look at the receiver's 2009 death review which came out in September 2010, it specifically says that there has been a significant downward trend over the past 4 years.   The suicides -- the 25 suicides in 2009 were 66 percent of the average for the preceding 3 years, and the 9 homicides were 60 percent of the average.   There have been significant improvements.   And the more important point in response to your specific question, Justice Sotomayor, is that the record in this case was cut off in August of 2008, and so what we have are -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Of course, but the problem I have with that, Mr. Phillips, is that at some point the Court has to say, \u201cYou have been given enough time, the constitutional violation still persists as the State itself acknowledges\u201d \u2013 "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " --Well, I'm not sure we've-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " -- \u201covercrowding is the principal -- overcrowding is the principal cause, as experts have testified, and it's now time for a remedy.   The Court can't -- has to at some point focus on the remedy, and that's what it did, and that it seems to me was a perfectly reasonable decision. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Justice Kennedy, I agree with everything you say except -- and I even agree with the last statement because, you know, you needed a significant remedy, there's no question about it, but you got a significant remedy when the receiver was appointed in 2005 and implemented a program in 2006. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " How much time do you think the receiver needed?   I mean, how much time did -- should the court have given the receiver to develop his plan and to try to implement his plan? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, there's no -- Justice Kagan, there is no specific time frame.   I mean, obviously we believe that we are entitled to a reasonable opportunity to comply with the receiver's orders and to bring ourselves ultimately into compliance with the Constitution, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, at some point the State itself said that if it had I think seven years, it could get down to 137.5, and didn't seem to object to that? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " No, that's -- Justice Kennedy, you know, given all of the other constraints, et cetera -- again, there is a fundamental difference between what you do under the hammer of a district court order, which is what we have under these circumstances, and what the State will do.   That said, the State is absolutely committed.   I mean the -- again, to go back to what is the root cause of the constitutional violation, it's not overcrowding.   I mean, when California violated the constitutional rights of the mentally ill in the 1990s, the prisons weren't crowded.   It was because there was a fundamental lack of attentiveness to medical care under those circumstances and that is unfortunate, to be sure more than that.   But that was the reason, to go back to your point, Justice Kennedy, that's why the, receiver, which is an extraordinary remedy, to confer upon a private individual the entire authority to run the California Department of Corrections, not just simply a facility or anything like that, but the entire Department of Corrections' medical health provision, is incredible. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But I thought that officer himself said, \u201cI can't do this without as a first step reducing the population.   Nothing else is going to work until we reduce the population to the point where there is room for clinics, room for medical personnel to operate.\u201d   I mean, that was the view of the district judge, the special master in one case, the receiver in the other case, everybody, they all agreed reducing the population is not going to cure it, not going to make everything perfect, but without doing that as a first step, nothing -- there will be no cure. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, Justice Ginsburg, even if you accept that, and I don't think that's precisely how I would interpret what the receiver said under these circumstances anyway, but even if you accept that, the idea of a 137.5 percent designed cap that has to be implemented within fewer than two years is a remedy that is neither necessary nor sufficient and is not aimed at the specific class.   It doesn't remedy the specific Federal rights as required by the Prisoners Litigation Reform Act. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I don't get the class thing, because what -- you can't have a remedy just limited to the class.   The class wants to have clinics.   They want to have personnel who function someplace outside of a broom closet.   So you can't deal with this problem by just dealing with the mentally ill and the people with medical problems.   You have to provide space for facilities. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " I think, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the fundamental point here is that it may eventually be that you have to get to that stage, but if you look at the receiver's reports since August 2008, which consistently analyzed this issue, and they say, \u201cwe have been able successfully to bring in very qualified personnel, and we have significantly larger numbers.   We know there is construction in place.   It may not be as substantial as what I originally proposed, it is nevertheless very significant\u201d and Congress was very explicit that the remedy of a prisoner release order should be the remedy of -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Where do I look at to find this?   It's a big record.   What I did was I -- it refers to on-line evidence and I went and looked at the pictures, and the pictures are pretty horrendous to me and I would say page 10 of the religious group's brief, for example, shows you one of them and what they are saying is, it's -- it's obvious, just look at it.   You cannot have mental health facilities that will stop people from killing themselves and you cannot have medical facilities that will stop staph and tubercular infection in conditions like this and then you look at them and you've looked at them.   I have looked at them and what is the answer to that?   There is nothing in here that -- the special master said $8 billion is the answer, and they haven't come close.   So how can I or you if you were in my position, what would you say in an opinion that says that these three judges who have 200 pages of findings, what would you say to, to -- as an answer to what I just said? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " I would say that the Prisoners Litigation Reform Act has a series of very specific requirements that the Federal court has to comply with and that in deciding to go to the three-judge district court in the first instance, you have to examine the orders that are in place and whether those orders have had a reasonable time within which to operate. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Yes, but the State -- the State did not claim that either order in either case has succeeded in achieving the remedy.   You have never claimed that. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, it depends on what you mean by -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And -- and -- and just if I can have your attention for a moment, I have this problem with the case.   Overcrowding is of course always the cause.   If I am running a hotel -- if I am looking at a highway system, I need a highway, what's the number of cars?   If the problem is bad service in a hotel, well, it's the number of employees per -- per guest.   I mean, that's fairly simple.   Now, I recognize of course that Congress has -- had imposed a special duty on us, but I think it means that overcrowding must not be ordered unless that is the only efficacious remedy in -- in a permissible period of time and it seems to me there is massive expert testimony to support that proposition on the part of the prisoners. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " I mean, it seems to me that, first of all, I'm not sure that is consistent with the language, that\u2019s primary cause of the constitutional violation, not the primary impediment to the implementation of a specific remedy.   So I think that is still a difficult and open question as to how to proceed, but it still strikes me that the sequence that Congress envisions and the one that would make the most sense and ultimately the one that hopefully would accommodate both the plaintiffs' interests and the State's interests, and the Department of Corrections' interests, is to allow the receiver to stay on a course that candidly I think will in fact get you there.   I mean, again, one of the real flaws in this case, Justice Kennedy, is nobody doubts for a moment that there have been very significant violations of constitutional rights years gone by, and indeed a failure on the mental health side ultimately to get you -- get to the point where we are in fact providing a significant remedy.   The reality is that in the course of the last three to four years under the guidance of the -- of the receiver, who coordinates with the special master on the mental health side, and does it with the cooperation of the State of California, there have been significant -- there has been significant movement in the right direction and if the court had not jumped the gun and said, look, we're not going to -- we're not going to let that part play itself out, we are going to leap ahead and go to a three-judge court and go to the prisons with the prisoner release order, this process would have played itself out and we wouldn't be here -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All this talk about what the receiver may think can be done seems a little bit perplexing to me because the receiver did not testify before the three-judge court, isn't that correct?

Phillips", "text": " We were not allowed to -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And now he has submitted what is styled in amicus brief where he doesn't address issues of law.   He explains his views about -- he tries to explain prior statements and supplement those prior statements.   Is that proper? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G.

"}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I thought the -- the -- that brief was filed because the -- there were, in your presentations there were representations about the special master, and he filed that brief to say, \u201cYou must understand this in context, I was making a speech at the club,\u201d but he wanted to put in context what you had used.   You had quoted his statements. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, to be sure, although, candidly, we had -- we had referred to some of those same statements even in the jurisdictional statement in this litigation.   Those have been part of the case for quite some time.   So I -- I don't know what motivated the special master to file an out-of-time brief -- or I mean, the receiver to file an out-of-time brief, but I understand -- but you know, we didn't object to it so long as the court was of a mind to hear from the receiver.   But I do think the most important part of that though to keep in mind in this context is the receiver didn't ask for this Court to affirm.   The receiver simply clarified certain statements that had been made and tried to say, as Justice Alito described, put them into some kind of context and that's -- and that's fine, and we obviously don't have any quarrel with -- with that particular presentation.   But I do think to say that the receiver has insisted that he cannot get to a constitutionally permissible result without the order that has been imposed in this particular case is -- is simply not consistent with either the record and it's certainly not consistent with that amicus brief. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, but the experts testified to that effect? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G.

There is no evidence \u2013 "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What specifically will happen?   I mean, at the moment, you know, we could go through, we have all these briefs, I mean there are all these experts, all the reports.   Everybody is saying you need to spend the money and we have -- if you really want to cure the constitutional violation, we have the legislature rejecting 8 billion but 2, which doesn't -- 2.35, and so -- nothing, and a void and give us more time.   I mean, I read the newspaper.   It doesn't seem to me California has been voting a lot of money for new programs.   The -- the -- what is it -- what is it specifically that would happen that would cure this problem were we to say -- I mean, a big human rights problem -- what would we say -- what would happen if we were to say, no, this panel's wrong?   What would happen that would cure the problem? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Well, it depends I suppose on some ways on how you -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

If the Court concludes that it was appropriate to convene it, but 137.5 percent is not narrowly tailored, it would be a different one.   Either way, it will go back obviously to a court of equity.   The receiver is in place.   The receiver has a comprehensive plan in place which he is implementing as we speak.   One of the things that -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " One piece of it -- you said something about the 2.35 million, they didn't come up with the 8 million, but they did come up with the 2.35 billion and then I'm just looking at this brief for the receiver and there is a footnote, page 11, footnote 3, that says, \u201cNo, that money isn't there.

You know, you have these judges who have been involved in these cases since the beginning, for 20 years in the Plata case, who thought, we've done everything we can.   The receiver has done everything he can.   This just isn't going anywhere and it won't go anywhere until we can address this root cause of the problem and that was the view of the judges who had been closest to the cases from the beginning and the view of the three-judge court generally.   So how can we reach a result essentially without, you know, re-finding the facts that they have been dealing with for 20 years? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " The fundamental problem with the fact-finding in this -- well, there are actually two fundamental problems.   First of all, remember that the receiver gets appointed and then three months later you get a motion for a three-judge court.   The three-judge court convenes itself before the receiver has even finalized the comprehensive plan to bring everybody into compliance in the first instance.   So the reality is that is the fundamental legal error I'm asking this Court to correct.   But even if you get beyond that and you are looking at the primary cause analysis, it seems to me that's -- that's at most, at best, a mixed question of law and fact, and it's the kind of standard that this Court ought to analyze to determine in the first instance and on an independent review whether or not the overcrowding is \"the primary cause of the violation.\"   And what makes that inquiry particularly appropriate for this Court, as opposed to simply slavishly adhering and deferring to the district court in this circumstance, is that the district court arbitrarily cut off the record in August of 2008 and there have been enormous developments since then and there were enormous developments -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Can you explain me something about that, it was confusing in the brief, Mr. Phillips?   I thought that the State had said, \u201cWe don't want the plaintiffs to tour these facilities any more.   We don't want to have discovery go beyond, what it was, some date in 2008.\u201d   I thought that it was the State that was urging, \u201cWe don't need any more discovery, we don't want any more inspection tours.\u201d   So how could -- how could the plaintiffs submit more than they did when the State said it's enough, 2008 should be the cutoff?

Justice Ginsburg, I understand what the ordinary rule would be of a court of equity dealing with a constitutional violation, but we are talking about an order entered under the Prisoners Litigation Reform Act, and it's quite clear, the statute couldn't be any plainer, that it shifts the burden significantly onto the plaintiff when you are going to go for a remedy as extreme as insisting that somewhere between potentially 36,000 and 45,000 inmates be released within a two-year period of time.   Again, if you go back, the receiver has not -- at the time that all of this took place, the receiver had been appointed.   The receiver had devised a plan.   The receiver is currently spending an enormous amount of money, $4 billion on healthcare, to get -- to get the system moving in the right direction, with the right attitude, in order to bring ourselves without question into constitutional compliance.   The truth is we haven't really had an assessment of where we are in the constitutional compliance spectrum.

But even that it seems to me would be a mistake under these circumstances where the special master and receiver have been in a sense joined at the hip in a variety of ways, it only makes sense, because the receiver is controlling the provision of medical care in the CDCR and the special master is taking care of or trying to promote a very small slice of that.

If there were -- if the cells were crowded, but the prison had all the other facilities available, then there might not be a problem.   You have to -- well, I hope you can understand that in this case, the prisons were built to double-cell the prisoners, but they weren't built to provide 200 percent of healthcare needs.   So as soon as they started to double-cell these prisoners, they could meet their literal housing needs in the space of the cell, but they couldn't meet the needs of their healthcare and that's why, Your Honor, the 137.5 percent figure is reasonable because the Court went almost a third overcrowding above what all the experts recommended.

Why not go directly to the problem rather than address what seems to be a different issue altogether?

The first point, it's important to understand that this is not a release order.   It's a population crowding reduction order.   The court is not ordering the State to throw open the gates of its doors and release people.   They can reduce crowding through more transfers to out of State.

So that goes to the second part of your question, which is why don't they try other things, like ordering the prisons to hire more doctors, ordering better medication management, all of those kinds of things?   And the answer to that is in the appendix to the Appellee's Coleman brief, which lists 70 discrete orders which the Coleman court, single-judge Coleman court, tried over a period of 15 years, which have proven singularly to be ineffective and that is why the court analyzed all those things.   The trial court analyzed all those things, and it made a finding of fact that based on the statements by the special master, by the receiver's reports, and by the general horrendous conditions which we have in these prisons, that those discrete orders would not solve the problem and given the level of harm -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

All of the testimony that they heard from experts from Texas, from Pennsylvania, from Washington State, all of whom had suffered, had dealt with crowding in their prison systems, has said that when you reduce the crowding, that's the critical thing that you have to do now because unless you reduce the crowding, nothing else is going to work, and the court found that that was exactly true.   Nothing else over 20 years in one case, and over 8 years in another case has worked and all -- as Justice Kennedy said, massive amounts of evidence show that the primary reason it hasn't worked is one singular word, overcrowding and when you reduce overcrowding the prison will be able to operate and will be able to provide those services that it can't provide now, so the doctors will have room to be able to work, which they don't have now.

The Secretary of the Department of Corrections who was the secretary at the time of trial testified that he was in favor, for example, of increasing prisoner's good time credits.   That's one way to reduce crowding and moreover, there was statistical evidence saying, looking at all the other States that had reduced their prison population over a period of about 15 years, and they all came to the same conclusion, all of those studies came to the same conclusion, which is there is no -- there is no increase in the crime rate.

It didn't take into account healthcare needs, which is the issue here and our experts testified that because it didn't take into account healthcare needs, 130 percent was the better number.   It's the number that the strike team had thought of, the administration's own strike team.   It's the number that these professional experts believed would be sufficient to remedy the population and back to my answer to Justice Alito's question is, the healthcare facilities themselves were built to provide services to only 100 percent -- healthcare services to only 100 percent of prisoners.

They wanted to do what you're saying, which was to minimize the intrusion and maximize the population.

The State comes back and makes a showing supported by experts saying, look, if you give us 4 years, we can reach the figure without releasing any prisoners.   Do you think it would violate the Prison Litigation Reform Act for the district court to say, no, I want this done in 2 years, not 4 years, and we just have to deal with the fact that there are going to be 40,000 prisoners out on the streets? "}, {"speaker": "Donald Specter", "text": " Well, the Prison Litigation Reform Act requires the court to give substantial weight to the public safety implications of its decision.   So under those circumstances, it's -- under those hypothetical circumstances, there is always the possibility that in those cases, the degree of public safety problems might outweigh the harm.   That -- as you said, that's not this case.   They found that we could do it and they -- the three-judge panel found that the State could reduce the population safely.   And there was no suggestion then in the record that this 2 or 4-year period would make that much of a difference.   You have to put the 40,000 or 35,000 figure in context.   California releases 120,000 prisoners every year on parole.

Okay, that seems to be the gamut.   Is there any evidence, statistically or otherwise because it used to be that States did rely on halfway houses, it relied upon, they relied upon -- they relied upon certain camps -- prison camps, for example -- and some of them were pretty tough and there were a whole range of what used to be called intermediate punishments.

What is the State supposed to do in that situation? "}, {"speaker": "Donald Specter", "text": " Well, my simple answer to your question, Your Honor, and I don't mean to be flippant, but they're -- they have an obligation to follow the Federal law, the constitutional law, and other laws and if they are not, then the Federal court has an obligation to impose a remedy.   In this particular case, the State has a choice.   It can either incarcerate 140,000 prisoners in a system built for 80,000, or it can incarcerate a lesser number.   If it chooses to incarcerate 148,000 prisoners in a space built for 80, it's going to incur certain obligations and we believe, as I said in the answer to Justice Breyer's question, the State could choose to use less restrictive punishments, alternative punishments, get a better bang for their buck, have more public safety, but that's -- if we -- if the court imposed that kind of a rule, then the State would be here saying it's -- it's violating comity provisions and making policy choices for the State which it shouldn't.   I believe in this case, the court gave the State the maximum degree of flexibility to make all the policy choices surrounding -- surrounding the incarceration of these prisoners.   You just -- the Constitution prevents the State from incarcerating somebody and then not providing them the basic medical care they need to escape from the prison and not die before their sentence is out and that's what we have here.

The 5-year -- the 5-year period is longer and the 5-year period is longer because it takes time to construct the facilities that the -- that State wants to construct.

The other point I want to make with respect to Justice Kennedy's question is that there is not a shred of evidence that 137.5 makes any sense whatsoever.   That is a pulled out of the air number.   Theirs was aspirational.   None of that is based on what is the constitutional violation that exists at the time you adopt that particular percentage.
