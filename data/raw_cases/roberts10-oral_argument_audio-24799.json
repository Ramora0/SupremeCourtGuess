"}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the wake of the nation's failed experiment with prohibition, the Twenty-First Amendment restored to the states the powers that they previously had under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts.   In exercising those powers, both before prohibition and in its immediate aftermath, states enacted residency requirements, like Tennessee's, to regulate the sale of alcohol within their territory. All along the way, this Court recognized the states' power to do so as part of their virtually complete control over how to structure the liquor distribution system. Under Granholm, that unbroken and undisputed history is dispositive.   Residency requirements like Tennessee's are protected from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny because they were authorized by the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts and uniformly considered constitutional at the time of ratification. Respondents offer -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could I ask you to clarify for me your position? Justice Sutton, in his dissent, basically said, if your legislature came and said we don't want out-of-state wholesalers, distributors, or retailers to be in our chain of distribution, because they're going to take business away from our local enterprises, period, end of story -- are you saying that the state can do that? Are you disagreeing with Justice -- with Judge Sutton? Or do you think that there's an economic protectionism -- protection against what a state can do? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " So I don't think that there is an economic protectionism exception to the Twenty-First Amendment, but even if there were one, as Judge Sutton recognized in applying his test to the two-year residency requirement in this case -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The problem is -- "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " -- we would still prevail.

It was written as a whole.   It's one paragraph that says two years, plus 10.   So it's really 12 years because -- and he said there's no economic justification for a 10-year residency requirement.   So what you have to look at is not whether it's two years but whether there's any reason for a 12-year residency requirement.   I mean, if he said no to 10, then it's no to 12.

But my fundamental question is the -- you believe the Twenty-First Amendment permits states to discriminate against out-of-state interests, then does that mean Bacchus, Granholm, all our jurisprudence that has invalidated certain state laws was wrong? Is that -- are you suggesting we should just disavow all those cases and forget them? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " No.   No, we're not.

"}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " No, it's not, and -- and let me explain how to harmonize it. Granholm -- Granholm mandated a historical test.   The question in Granholm, which all nine justices agreed upon, was what were the state's pre-prohibition powers.   Now the disagreement in Granholm was about whether states could discriminate against out-of-state products pre-prohibition, but the framework was not an economic protectionism framework; it was a historical question.

"}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " There would not be a dormant Commerce Clause problem with a 10-year residency requirement.   There might be some other constitutional challenge to that, but it would be immune from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny as long as it treated in-state and out-of-state products the same. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   Suppose if it was a -- a grandparents requirement.   So you can't -- you can't get a liquor license in Tennessee unless your grandparents were Tennessee residents.   That would not create a dormant Commerce Clause problem? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " It would not create a dormant Commerce Clause problem because the whole point of the Twenty-First Amendment was to constitutionalize the pre-prohibition powers, which included the power to discriminate against out-of-state interests. If you think about the -- the three-tier system and the in-state wholesaler requirement, for example, that this Court in Granholm itself said was unquestionably legitimate, that discriminates against out-of-state interests. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   Just -- I mean, just to understand the contours of your argument, so the -- to pick up on -- on something else Justice Sotomayor referred to, suppose you have a state statute that says for the exclusive purpose of protecting in-state retailers, no -- you must be a resident of the -- of the state for two years, five years, in order to get a license. Would that be -- would that be constitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " I still don't think there would be a dormant Commerce Clause problem with that. Now, under Bacchus, if you're looking at the language in Bacchus, Bacchus does talk about economic protectionism, but it does so in the context of a case that was discriminating against out-of-state products. If the rule from Bacchus -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Wholesalers. Bacchus -- Bacchus is -- "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Well, it -- it involved wholesalers, but it involved a tax -- it involved a tax exemption that applied only for in-state products rather than out-of-state products.   And that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, under your theory -- "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " -- the tax was collected through the wholesalers. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yeah, that's the problem.   I don't know why, under your theory of the dormant Commerce Clause, if the state can do what it wants within its borders because it's regulating liquor, I don't know why our cases would be right under your theory that they can't put a different tax on different products? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Because, under Granholm and under the history pre-prohibition, states could do virtually what they wanted within their borders but not everything.   And -- and one important carveout -- and this is reflected in the text of the Wilson Act itself -- is that they had -- had to treat in-state and out-of-state products the same. The Wilson Act itself says -- this is in the blue brief at page 26; it's 27 U.S.C. 121 -- that states have the power to ban the importation of liquor as long as they treat -- in violation of laws in the exercise of its police powers within the state, as long as they are treating liquor to the same extent and in the same manner as those such liquors had been produced in the state or territory.   So the pre-prohibition powers -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Then Ziffrin -- then Ziffrin was wrong? One of the cases you rely on.   Because Ziffrin was really the counter to Bacchus, wasn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Uh -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And -- and Ziffrin basically said you can discriminate in terms of taxes basically. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " But not based on products.   And the -- the key point from Bacchus was that it was about discrimination based on products. If the rule that came out of Bacchus were just a straight economic protectionism test, Granholm would have been a much easier case.   Granholm could have been written by saying the question is, do the Michigan and New York laws at issue -- are they meant to protect in-state producers or not? That wasn't the analysis that Granholm used.   Instead, again, Granholm set forth this historical test that required the court to look back at the pre-prohibition powers. And the -- the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts, first of all, empowered states to regulate interstate shipment of alcohol so long as they treated in-state and out-of-state alcohol the same.   And then, second, at that time, pre-prohibition, states also had the inherent authority to regulate in-state sales. So, combined, that meant that states, pre-prohibition, were free to structure the in-state liquor distribution systems free from Commerce Clause scrutiny, again, as long as they treated in-state and out-of-state products the same. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Does it apply the Commerce Clause? I mean, if you go back to 1920, maybe they said you can only be sold on the basis of race or the basis of gender or some -- I mean, it can't be 100 percent whatever they did in 1920. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Well, that's right, but that's because the Twenty-First Amendment and the pre-prohibition powers that we're talking about are -- are powers related to overriding the dormant Commerce Clause specifically, not other constitutional provisions like the First Amendment or -- or partially these others. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So now, in other words, your position, your view is all the other amendments apply, okay, the Commerce Clause applies too as long as it wasn't part of the distribution system in the Wilson Act. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " And -- and that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But, if it's part of the distribution of the Wilson Act, then it's free of Commerce Clause, but, otherwise, it's subject to it, and it's also subject to everything else. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Well, I -- I wouldn't quite -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Is that -- is that basically -- have I got it basically right? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " No.   I -- I wouldn't quite say we're looking at the distribution system pre the Wilson Act.   But the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts, which were constitutionalized in the Twenty-First Amendment, were all about permitting states to act in ways that did restrain commerce, but they weren't about permitting states to act in ways that violated the First Amendment or other, you know, individual rights, for example. And so -- and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So that's where you're wrong because the law then did provide for racial discrimination, and there's nothing in the provision that limits itself to the Commerce Clause. It just says: The transportation or importation into any state, territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors in violation of the laws thereof is hereby prohibited. I don't actually see in that any reference to the Commerce Clause or to any other limiting principle.   Yet we have cases that have found limiting principles. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Yes.   But this Court's cases, including the ones that have found limiting principles, and Granholm itself, all explain that the Twenty-First Amendment has to be understood in light of what it was trying to achieve, which was constitutionalizing these statutes.   And these statutes were dealing with commerce, notwithstanding their broad language. The problem that they were trying to solve and the state powers that they were trying to protect were related to powers because -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   Let me -- let me ask something about that.   I do understand that the Twenty-First Amendment was geared towards giving states greater freedom in controlling the distribution and sale of liquor in their jurisdiction. But I'm having a hard time understanding how the residency requirement does when it comes to a person's pre-existing residency.   So, yes, we understand that having someone there who's responsible to the community is necessary.   That was inherent in the three-tier system. But why is it inherent in the three-tier system that you have to have someone who's only a local do it? There are many states whose three-tier system doesn't require that.   They function fairly well. I -- I don't understand the necessity of that. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " So, first, I don't think the question is whether it's necessary or not.   The point of the Twenty-First Amendment is the courts aren't supposed to impose that kind of scrutiny.   States get to decide what distribution system works within their state. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, we just -- "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " There's no one size fits all solution. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I agree.   But there are some parts of the discrimination part of the -- of the Commerce Clause that we -- today still affect this. You're saying they can't use it to violate the First Amendment.   We've said you can't use it to discriminate against products, although nothing in here says you can't do that. I'm -- I'm having a hard time understanding.   Explain to me why it's necessary. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Let -- let -- let me make two points.   One, just quickly going back to your earlier question about the text of the Twenty-First Amendment, the text does refer to the delivery or use of alcohol.   So that -- that is invoking the sort of Commerce Clause concern that the history confirms. But, to get to your other question about the purposes of a durational residency requirement, everybody agrees that a residency requirement of some sort is constitutional, notwithstanding that it would otherwise raise Commerce Clause concerns. And the durational component of a residency requirement serves very much the same interests.   For example, residency requirements are important because they allow states to conduct background checks.   Having somebody be a -- a resident for a longer period of time allows the -- those who decide whether to issue licenses to actually observe the person and to observe the person's character and give the -- the state a better ability to decide whether to issue a license and to conduct the background check.   Likewise -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, now you're -- you're arguing that they serve a public health and safety purpose, and -- but I thought you -- you answered my previous question by saying it doesn't matter.   If the only purpose of the -- of the regulation -- and this is spelled out right in the statute itself -- is economic protectionism, that does not create a dormant Commerce Clause problem because the Twenty-First Amendment gave the states that authority. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " So -- so I think that's right.   I think there's no historical pedigree for an economic protectionism sort of exception.   If the Court were to engage in that, it would essentially be a standardless inquiry that would -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I think you're turning -- maybe you're turning it around, and maybe my understanding of history is wrong, so you'll correct me, but I thought that the purpose of the Eighteenth Amendment was a determination by those who adopted it and ratified it that alcohol created a public health and safety problem. And I thought the purpose of the -- the -- the Twenty-First Amendment and Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment was to say this is a determination, the public health and safety determination is not going to be made on the national level.   It's going to be made by the states.   But none of that seems to me to have anything to do with economic protectionism. But where am I wrong in that? What is the -- what is the -- the basis for thinking that the purpose of or a purpose of Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment was to authorize the states in this one area, dealing with alcohol, to engage in protectionist activities that wouldn't be permitted with respect to any other commodity? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " I -- I don't think the purpose was specifically to allow protectionist activity.   But I do think that the purpose was to shield state laws from scrutiny under the dormant Commerce Clause. And for sure, one way that states might exercise that authority would be economic protectionism.   But there's no historical pedigree for that kind of a carveout from what is otherwise virtually complete authority for states to legislate in this area free from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny.

Kavanaugh", "text": " When you say virtually complete authority, and you've said several times the point of the Twenty-First Amendment, the purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment, the problem that I'm having in thinking about this is the text -- the text of the Twenty-First Amendment does not support that, as I read it. You mentioned delivery or use, but it doesn't just say the states have complete authority over delivery or use.   It's talking about the transportation or importation into any state. And why isn't that most naturally read to allow states to remain dry and, therefore, ban transportation or importation, but not to otherwise impose discriminatory or, as Justice Alito says, protectionist regulations? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Two points in response to that, Justice Kavanaugh. First, the Twenty-First Amendment has to be read against the backdrop of the inherent authority that states already had to regulate the distribution systems within their system. The Twenty-First Amendment didn't need to say that expressly because it was understood at the time. Second, this Court in Midcal said -- and this is -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Wait.   I'm going to stop you there.   I'm sorry.

But it also restored to the states powers that they previously had to regulate -- regulate authority within their borders. I'd also direct the Court to Midcal, this is at 445 U.S. at 106, which said that although the Twenty-First Amendment on its face gives the states control over the transportation or importation, such control logically entails considerable regulatory power not strictly limited to importing and transporting alcohol. That too is referring to the Court's -- to the state's inherent power to regulate the systems within their states. If I may reserve the remainder of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

We know that, for example, from the Vance case in 1898.   The -- the Court's discussion there is very instructive.   Vance involved the South Carolina dispensary law, but the Court there said the dispensary law was comparable to a situation in which a state required for a retail license that the retailer be a resident of that state.

And is there anything in your argument that would give us a way to say, you know, when there's a 12-year residency requirement, when there's a 100 percent shareholder requirement, these have stopped being public health and safety measures; these are clearly protectionist and we should not allow those to occur?

It would be at odds with the broad regulatory discretion that's -- that's conferred by the Twenty-First Amendment. But -- but it's -- I think it's important to note also that the Respondents' approach -- which is not that approach, right? Their approach says no discrimination of any kind under the Twenty-First Amendment. And that approach really would leave the Twenty-First Amendment with no meaningful role to play in our modern constitutional order. Think about the three-tier system for a moment.   This Court described it in Granholm not only as unquestionably legitimate but also as involving sales to and purchases from an in-state wholesaler. Now that arrangement disadvantages out-of-state business interests.   It wouldn't fly if we were talking about milk or trash. But this Court has treated it as unquestionably legitimate because it's part of the state's choice about how to structure the in-state sale of this particularly dangerous product that has distinctive constitutional treatment under the Twenty-First Amendment. In the end, Respondents are asking this Court to treat alcohol like any other article of commerce.   But it's not.   It was actually 100 years ago today that the Eighteenth Amendment was -- was finally ratified.   And 14 years after that failed experiment, the Twenty-First Amendment restored to the individual states their broad police powers over delivery and sale of this product within their borders so long as they treated out-of-state and in-state products the same. And that proviso comes directly from the text of the Wilson Act, which was Congress's instruction as to how and to what extent to overturn this Court's original package doctrine case law from the late 19th Century.   That was the line Congress drew and no further. Granholm drew the same line.   It said we're not going to import all of the dormant Commerce Clause's non-discrimination principles into the Twenty-First Amendment, but we are going to import so much of it as the historical analysis and the Wilson Act require. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

"}, {"speaker": "David L. Franklin", "text": " Well, if I can quote from Midcal in the way that my colleague was beginning to do, what the Court said there is very instructive.   It said yes, in terms, the amendment gives states control over transportation and importation.   But, of course, such control -- I'm quoting still -- logically entails considerable regulatory power not strictly limited to importing and transporting alcohol.

Granholm and -- and Bacchus are not to the contrary.   What they do is undertake a historical analysis and recognize a proviso to that.

And the language of the Twenty-First Amendment speaks directly to exactly what the purpose of this entire exercise was. The problem that the two federal statutes were designed to deal with was the fact that states had complete authority to say we're not going to allow any use or sale of alcohol within our states and had absolutely no authority to stop the import from other states of -- of alcohol. In the first instance, in the original package doctrine, they could sell it to retailers, and then, ultimately, beyond that, they could sell it directly to consumers.   And the statutes were passed to stop that specific practice. And -- and then we go to the prohibition, which, as somebody already noted, is exactly 100 years ago today.   And then we come back and we repeal the prohibition.   And the language in Section 2 tracks very closely the language and the intention.   It's not designed -- it's not a grant of authority.   It's a protection against allowing out-of-state operators to come in and sell directly liquor under certain circumstances. That was the entire purpose of it. that's what the Court held in Bacchus, and that's what the Court held in -- in Granholm. Bacchus said it was not the -- I'll quote it -- \"doubts about the scope of the amendment's authorization, Section 2, notwithstanding, one thing is certain, the central purpose of the provision was not to empower states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.\" Candidly, I don't know that the Court had to go past Bacchus when it decided Granholm because those statutes were clearly just as economically protectionist as this one is, but the principle from Bacchus is, if a statute has no purpose, and this statute has no purpose except to be protectionist of the local industries, it's unconstitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Is that your standard? Because you seem to slide back and forth a little bit between standards in your brief -- or -- or I thought that you did maybe. If -- if a state can come forward with any purpose other than protectionism, the state wins? "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " No, no.   It's when the state doesn't come forward with anything except protectionism, the state loses.

And that's -- that's where -- I mean, Granholm, I think, could have concluded anyway that the statutes involved there were really just economic protectionism and not gone beyond it, but it did go beyond that. And what it said is, if, in fact, the state is engaged in discrimination under the -- under normal Commerce Clause standards, it's presumptively unconstitutional, and the state must come forward and justify the discrimination on the basis of non-discriminatory, less restrictive means of achieving the same objective. And under that standard -- and that's -- I'm perfectly comfortable with the standard, because there's no doubt that what we're talking about here is rank discrimination on the basis of commerce.

"}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " I do not challenge that whatsoever. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So now the challenge seems to me why is a pre-registration or pre-licensing residency requirement of the normal length, one or two years, because I think even the dissent below thought the 14 was too -- the 12 was too long, all right, but let's concentrate on the two.   Let's do the severability your adversary wants. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " Right.   Sure.

So the -- the core principle that's embedded in here, right, is the -- is that there's a non-discrimination principle.   And so adopting a durational residency requirement is, by definition, discriminating against out-of-state interests. And unless you're going to limit it just to producers, which is an irrational limitation this Court's never adopted with respect to any Commerce Clause analysis, we are being discriminated against.   And, therefore, it's the state's burden to come forward and to justify that discrimination. There is no rational basis for the two-year ban that they've put in place here. The Tennessee attorney general himself has twice looked at this ban and said it doesn't remotely serve any purpose that's designed under the Twenty-First Amendment when we're dealing with alcohol or public safety or public health or anything else.   It's only designed to exclude us. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Except for the attorney general may -- may represent the government, but the legislature gave a reason. "}, {"speaker": "Carter G. Phillips", "text": " And -- and the reason it gave was, because this is alcohol, we're protecting the public interest.   That's fine. But that doesn't remotely explain the two-year durational residency requirement. That just explains all of the other regulations that were adopted at the same time, including the 12-year residency requirement. So that -- it's their burden, and they should come forward not just in making statements to the legislature, they can come into court -- and that's what Granholm says. Look, you discriminate against out-of-state interests.   That triggers a burden on the state to justify the limitation -- the discrimination that it's imposed.   And what does it say? In this case, it said absolutely nothing. It didn't -- it didn't file a single affidavit.   It didn't put forward any kind of a witness.   It didn't put on any defense whatsoever.   And the reason is pretty clear. The sole purpose of this statute was, as my friend here who -- who represents the retailers association proves beyond any question, what this is designed to do is be exclusively protectionist, which is why in some places we say that's a basis for the Court to reach the decision, because this is exclusively protectionist, but, if you don't accept that, our fall-back position is Granholm requires them to come forward with more than they have come forward with.

The case that, it seems to me, speaks directly to this really is Walling versus Michigan.   It predates the Wilson Act.   It predates Webb-Kenyon.   It specifically says categorically that you cannot -- states cannot discriminate against out-of-state sellers by imposing a tax on them. And I guarantee you that under the -- under the approach offered by my friends on the other side, they read the Twenty-First Amendment to say: Of course, you can impose a tax on them because you're regulating the sale of alcohol, and if you regulate the sale of alcohol on a wholesaler, under those circumstances, you can put a billion-dollar tax on him as long as it's within the Twenty-First Amendment, and that's constitutional. And that predates all of these things. And nothing in the Wilson Act, nothing in the Webb-Kenyon Act, and certainly nothing in the Second Amendment -- Second -- or the Twenty-First Amendment was designed to overrule Walling. And, indeed, this Court said in Granholm, Granholm specifically, that that case and Scott -- and the third case whose name is going to escape me -- Tiernan, all three survived Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. So while it is true that they can -- they can -- they have virtual control -- virtually control -- virtual control is something else -- they have the ability to control the structure, that's simply a recognition of the three-tiered system. And just to go back to the history, what's the -- what's the purpose of the three-tiered system? It's to avoid the tied sales arrangement that gave rise to the prohibition in the first place.

That's one of our employee requirements. So, when they passed Webb-Kenyon, did they mean all of them except that one?

The second one is, if you want to take up the question and say, you know, what -- why is -- why is brick-and-mortar more important, well, brick-and-mortar is fully consistent with the three-tier system.

That's the issue before this Court. That seems to me so clearly beyond what the Twenty-First Amendment was designed to achieve that the Court simply should declare it unconstitutional.

"}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Respondents offer no administrable rule that would support even the basic presence requirement that this Court recognized in Granholm was unquestionably legitimate, and no account of the history. First, Respondents concede a residency requirement. A durational residency requirement follows from that: first, because states get to define what residency is, and, second, because the same interests that serve a presence requirement also serve a durational -- durational residency requirement. Duration facilitates background checks.   It facilitates investigation and enforcement of the law because somebody who's been there for a while is more likely to have substantial assets that can be enforced -- that can be seized, and is less likely to flee at the first sign of trouble. Once you concede that residency requirements are okay, courts shouldn't be second-guessing the extent to which those very same interests are served by durational residency requirements.   The whole point of the Twenty-First Amendment was to take that out of the hands of courts. With respect to the history, Mr. Phillips referred to Walling and to Scott. Both of those were cases like Granholm and Bacchus that involved taxing out-of-state product more heavily than in-state product. That is the exception that Granholm recognized to the state's virtually complete authority. But, when we're talking about purely in-state regulation, like a durational residency requirement for a liquor license, that is what the Twenty-First Amendment is concerned with. There's no economic protectionism test that is either consistent with the history or is administrable.   If the Court were to go down that road, there would be challenges to dozens of state laws. And how do we draw a line about whether 30 days is protectionist, a year is protectionist, two years is protectionist? At that point, the inquiry just becomes the same as any other dormant Commerce Clause challenge. And the one thing we know from the Twenty-First Amendment is that alcohol was to be treated differently for dormant Commerce Clause purposes.   Respondents' rule allow no room for that. Lastly, even if there were an economic protectionism test, for the reasons given by Judge Sutton in his dissent below, and for the reasons I said earlier, Tennessee's law satisfies the necessary level of scrutiny, which is not a searching sort of strict scrutiny but just is there a plausible reason for the law that makes it survive.
