[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in case 13-316, Loughrin v. United States.   Mr. Russell. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   This case presents the question whether to commit Federal bank fraud, a defendant must intend to defraud a bank, or whether, as the Tenth Circuit held, it's enough that the defendant intended to defraud someone in order to obtain money the victim keeps in a bank account.   Applying the Tenth Circuit's interpretation, the government has prosecuted people whose only relationship to a bank is that they tricked a third party into issuing them a perfectly valid check, which the defendant then cashed at a bank.   Such a broad interpretation of the Federal bank fraud statute threatens to sweep in a garden variety State law crime -- a broad sweep of the sort that this Court has refused to give to Federal criminal statutes absent a clear statement of congressional intent.   And that-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " If it's -- if it's the words Congress used,   \"obtained funds owned or controlled by financial -- a financial institution by means of false representation. \" "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Well, the problem is there is an ambiguity in Subsection 2 about to whom the false representation must be directed.   Now, I acknowledge that ordinarily, you would construe that silence in favor of breadth that -- in favor breadth that a false statement to anyone would do.   But there are compelling reasons not to give that ambiguity, that interpretation in this case.   And one is the breadth that I mentioned.   It enabled the government to bring cases like United States v. Rodriguez where the government prosecuted a bookkeeper who filed false invoices with her employer that led the employer then to issue perfectly valid checks to people who didn't do the work. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but the breadth is confined -- given the development of the banking system, it may not seem as significant a limitation today as in years past.   But, nonetheless, the definition of a financial institution is -- in 18 U.S.C. 20 is limited to institutions with a particular Federal nexus.   Federal Deposit Insurance, Federal Home Loan Bank, Small Business Investment Act.   It isn't any financial institution, but institutions in which the Federal Government has a particular interest. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " That's true.   But nonetheless, for precisely the reason you identified, it -- it covers an awful lot of banks.   And if you read the statute-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How about in this case, and that's where I'm having difficulty.   Why is it illogical to think that a falsehood rendered through a third party that might affect a bank, a false check, as your client was charged with, that that would be the very case Congress would have wanted covered? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --So that's a question about, I think, whether intent to defraud a bank could be satisfied in a case like this.   And I think that the answer to that is possibly it could.   So the government, I think, tries to put you into a false choice between saying you either have to accept the Tenth Circuit's interpretation that sweeps in cases like United States v. Rodriguez, perfectly valid checks that don't implicate either of the core interests in a bank fraud case, which is protecting the bank from financial harm or protecting the bank from being lied to.   You either have to accept that or you have to leave unprosecutable cases like this one.   But that's not true. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " How would that -- how would that work?   Would the jury have to be instructed about the U.C.C. and be asked to determine whether the bank or Target, in this case, would be liable for the funds if the bank had honored a forged check? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " So that gets the -- we have two theories.   We have the theory that intent to defraud a bank is required and under that theory, the U.C.C. doesn't matter.   We also argue, though, if you don't require intent to defraud a bank-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why would it not matter? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Because under the government -- it doesn't matter under the government's view or ours, so-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No, under your view.   Under your view that there has to be an intent to defraud a bank.   Why would it not matter from -- who would ultimately be liable for the -- for the money -- for the amount of the check? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Under our view, all the government has to show is that the defendant intended to deceive a bank in order to obtain property that is owned by or in the custody of a bank.   So in a bank account.   So a traditional altered check case-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I think on anybody's theory, you -- you have to show that -- that the monies, funds, credits, assets, securities or other property was owned by or under the custody or control of the financial institution.

Russell", "text": " That's correct.   So the point of departure is to whom the false statement has to be directed. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But -- but the jury has to be instructed that the money's coming out of the bank. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " That's correct.   That's correct.   And so that's -- to the extent you think the U.C.C. is implicated in that inquiry, that -- that is true under either one.   I don't think that it is.   I think it's just going to be a question of, you know, whose money are you trying to get and is it in a bank account. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Two of the -- two of the six checks involved were paid by the drawing bank.   Isn't that so? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " That is correct.   And so -- but under our principal view that the problem here is that the government -- that the jury wasn't instructed that Petitioner had to intend to defraud a bank as opposed to Target.   And so it doesn't matter whether the checks were cashed or not.   And it doesn't even matter under the risk of loss theory because it only has to be a risk of loss, not an actual loss. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I think you have a -- you have a credible textual argument, but you run into the problem that your interpretation makes Section -- Subsection 1 surplusage.   How do you get around that? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " I don't know that we do, but the Tenth Circuit's interpretation doesn't either, because under the Tenth Circuit's interpretation, one is rendered surplusage because any prosecution that could be brought under (1) could also be brought under (2).   If it's enough under (2) that you intend to defraud someone, it's surely enough that you intended to defraud a bank. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, under the alternative, there is certainly overlap, but (2) reaches a much broader category or it reaches a broader category.   So it's not useless. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " No, that's true.   And-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Representation doesn't have to be made to the bank under (2).   (2) covers those instances where the representation is made to somebody else.   (1) would be limited to those, perhaps, in which the representation is made to the bank.   But under your interpretation where (2) requires that the representation be made to the bank, there is no point in having two subsections.   You might as well just have one. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Well, I have two things to say to that.   One is Congress may have thought that what they were doing in (2) is making clear that the statute encompasses the broad range of particular kinds of property interests that are unique or -- or at least common in the banking context.   And in that way it serves the same function as the second clause in the mail fraud statute upon which this statute is premised. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It doesn't have the two subparts.   But here you are essentially asking us to read the word \u2036 or \u2033, \u2036 (1) or (2) \u2033 to mean (1) including (2). "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Well, that's the same way that this Court has repeatedly read the two parallel clauses of the bank fraud statute.   The only difference being, you know, the difference in hardware terms and numerals.   But I don't think-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What this Court did after the -- after -- or before this statute -- this statute was passed before the Court's interpretation of the mail fraud statute. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Every court that had looked at it at the time the statute was passed had determined there were two separate provisions.   So why would Congress have any reason to believe they were passing a singular case, a singular charge? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " I think what Congress would have intended is simply that when it uses the identical -- materially identical language and structure in two statutes, that they would have the same meaning as determined by this Court.   The interpretive principle that the government relies on that identically-worded statutes can mean very different things depending on the state of the circuit law at the time Congress copies the language is really untenable.   And it requires a criminal defendant, for example, to know what that circuit precedent was and not be able to simply rely on this Court's decisions interpreting the identical language in another statute. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But it's not identical because in the bank court statute, Congress broke out and separately numbered (1) and (2) and they didn't do that in the mail fraud. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Now, I understand that.   But I don't think that if Congress intended this statute to operate dramatically different from the mail fraud statute, the only change it would have made was as those sort of typographical changes.   I don't think that's the way Congress conveys that kind of intent.   But again, even if you think that Subsection (2) creates an independent offense, it's susceptible of the interpretation that we give you, which avoids having to federalize the kinds of cases that are at issue in United States v. Rodriguez. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " One understanding of what led to this statute is this Court's decision in Maze, which actually seems on all fours with this case, right?   Use of a fraudulent credit card to a merchant who then asks for money from the bank.   Essentially the same case as this with a fraudulent credit card as opposed to a fraudulent check.   So if we understand this statute as arising from Congress's desire to make that bank fraud, why should we rule for you here? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Well, I guess I have to just dispute the premise.   I think Congress was reacting to the rule, the principle of law that Maze adopted, which made it impossible to use the wire fraud statute and mail fraud statute to prosecute a case even when somebody goes into a bank and cashes a counterfeit check because the then use of the mail to settle the account afterwards wasn't good enough.   And that's what Congress was concerned of.   In this Court's own decision in Maze, the Court noted that Congress had dealt with the specific factual problem in Maze through an amendment, then recent amendment to the Truth-in-Lending Act, which prohibited credit card fraud.   Congress added to those remedies in another section of the same statute that enacted the bank fraud statute and then dealt with the parallel problem with respect to altered checks in Section 513, which is part of that same statute, which criminalizes any use of an altered check to deceive anyone without regard to whose property the defendant is intending to obtain.   So when you're worried about altered check cases here, and we need to not just be worried about these cases because this decision will implicate a whole host of other cases.   But if you're thinking just about altered check cases, Congress dealt with altered check cases in Section 513.   And that's important because the penalties under 513 and 31 -- and the bank fraud provision are very different.   It's a 30-year sentence for bank fraud and a 10-year sentence for a Section 513.   And more importantly, the bank fraud statute is a predicate for aggravated identity theft, which imposes a mandatory 2-year minimum sentence that must be served consecutive to any other sentence.   And so in a petty case like this, the difference between somebody being charged for bank fraud and being charged under 513 for a first-time offender can be the difference between zero to 6 months and 2 to 2 and a half years.   And that gives the government enormous plea bargaining leverage.   So you can understand where the government wants a broad interpretation here.   But it's equally understandable that Congress would have thought that cases in which somebody's using an altered check in a way that negligently or knowingly poses some risk to a bank is -- warrants less punishment than when somebody directly targets the bank itself for deception in order to obtain bank property. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Why -- why is that?   Why would Congress have wanted to make that difference? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Well, because I think Congress-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I agree with you that the disparity in -- in punishment is quite substantial. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Yeah.   I think that Congress would have thought it's more serious for somebody to target a bank than it is for somebody to use an altered check that has a risk to a bank.   Because as this case illustrates, using an altered check doesn't necessarily impose a financial cost on the bank.   Here Target intercepted most -- most -- we have a disagreement with the government whether it was three or four of the checks, but -- and the bank itself made -- discovered the alteration and refused to honor the check.   But when you are intending to defraud the bank, that's -- the Congress could think that's a much more serious thing.   And I do think that, you know-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It does -- it does seem to me that this case can be distinguished from the example you gave in your yellow brief of the person that sells a magazine subscription and he gets the check and he never intends to deliver the magazines.   In that case, the bank will -- will honor the check, I assume. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And must.   And must do so. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " That's correct.   And so-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And that's quite different than this case. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --So the question is how to get rid of those cases while preserving the government's ability to prosecute. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, you can do so, I suppose, through the government's proposed fallback position. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " --at page 40 of its brief which talks about a risk of loss. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " So there are -- there are several things wrong with the government's fallback position and it leads in most cases to the same result as intent to defraud.   So in paradigmatic bank fraud cases, both our rule and their fallback rule permits prosecution.   The only real difference is that their rule is -- is designed to permit prosecution in third-party check fraud cases like ours.   Because if it's an altered check that's presented to the bank, we acknowledge that shows intent to defraud the bank.   So we're only talking about cases like ours where an altered check is presented to a third party and the government's rule permits them to continue to prosecute those cases.   Now, even if you agree with them that those kinds of cases fall within the scope of the statute, that -- all you need to do then is to say, look, those cases aren't materially different than when you submit the check to the bank in the first place, that the altered check shows intent to defraud the bank in third-party cases just like it does in a first-party case.   Now, we think that they're wrong about whether or not these kinds of cases are covered.   And if we're right about that, then there's obviously no reason to adopt, you know, a rule that they made up just to deal with those kinds of cases.   And maybe I could turn to that argument just for a second. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, could I ask you this question?   Suppose the defendant testifies and suppose the jury believes the defendant.   The defendant testifies as follows: I never intended to defraud the bank.   I knew that the cashiers at this particular retail establishment were incredibly careful -- careless and so I got these checks and they were made out to my neighbor John Doe.   I stole them from his mailbox.   I crossed out his name and I wrote in the name of the retail establishment and I knew these cashiers were so careless that they would honor the check.   However, I never thought any bank would do that.   So I didn't intend to defraud the bank.   I intended to defraud the retail establishment.   Now, under your theory that -- that if the jury believed that, the person would not be guilty of the offense. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " That's right.   And I don't think that those cases are covered for an additional reason as well.   And that is, the fraud there is not intended to obtain bank property.   Under Subsection (2), it's not any fraud that implicates bank property.   The object of the fraud must be to obtain the property that is owned by or in the custody or control of the -- of the bank.   And in a case like this, what my client obtained was DVD players and groceries and a printer, and those were not property owned by or in the custody or control of the bank. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, why doesn't that principle cover most of the cases you're worried about? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Well, it doesn't cover the cases like Rodriguez, because the government can argue there that -- so, I don't know if I've finished the description of Rodriguez, but in that case, a bookkeeper submitted false invoices to her employer.   The employer issued valid checks to a third party, who then cashed it.   And the government can say in a case like that, cashing the check results in you obtaining money in the custody or control of the bank.   That's what you get in exchange for the check.   And you obtained it by means of a false statement to someone, i.e., the false invoice submitted to the employer.   And so it doesn't -- adopting our view of what bank property is doesn't completely eliminate the problem.   We would win the case.   But it doesn't-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Why -- why wouldn't your view have enabled you to win this case? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --It would -- it should have.   I mean, we've brought a sufficiency of the evidence challenge with respect to whether -- whose property this is.   And the jury-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So if we think that was wrong, there's a lot less to this case than meets the eye. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --There is -- that could be the end of this case.   It doesn't resolve the circuit conflict, which there is still a circuit conflict about whether intent to defraud a bank is required in cases not involving this circumstance of a third party.   But we do think that you shouldn't believe that just because -- if you agree with the government that third-party altered check cases fall within the scope of the statute, that's not a reason to forego requiring the government to prove intent to defraud the bank.   It's just a reason to say that, as a number of circuits have, that use of that altered check shows intent to defraud a bank.   The government has been able to prosecute altered check cases, including altered third-party check -- altered check cases to third parties, in circuits that require intent to defraud the bank.   The other thing that's wrong-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What's the theory behind that?   Why would presenting an altered check to a third party constitute sufficient evidence of intent to defraud a bank? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Well, I think the theory is that the use of an altered check shows intent to deceive the bank.   And then these courts simply view obtaining the property of a third party using that check as materially identical to obtaining that property directly from a bank, I think is the theory. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Usually there won't be evidence, direct evidence of the defendant's intent.   So the defendant's intent will be inferred from objective evidence -- will be inferred from other evidence, and then you will get into the question of whether the retailer who initially accepts the check or the bank is ultimately going to be liable for the amount of that check.   If you're -- if you're in a situation in which the -- the retailer is going to be liable, that -- maybe that supports the -- the inference that the defendant never intended to defraud the bank.   If you're in a situation where the bank is going to be liable, it supports the inference that the defendant intended to defraud the bank.   So won't you get into this somewhat complicated UCC question about who is ultimately going to be liable for the amount?   I think that's a problem with your argument, but maybe there's an answer to it. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Well, I think that there is and maybe I'm not explaining it very well.   So there's two pieces of intent to defraud the bank.   There's intent to deceive the bank and intent thereby to obtain bank property.   With respect to intent to deceive the bank, I think the courts have uniformly found in -- in cases, at least first party cases, that use of an altered check is sufficient evidence to show that you intend to deceive the bank.   And when you intend -- whether you intend to deceive the bank, it doesn't matter who's going to end up bearing the cost at the end.   It's just a question-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Doesn't -- doesn't that U.C.C. question arise anyway under the requirement that you have to -- you have to obtain bank property? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --It -- it potentially does if you're willing to-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Doesn't it require you to ultimately decide who's -- who's going to be stuck with the -- with the empty bag? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --It -- it potentially could if you're willing to say that somebody who obtains property from Target potentially is obtaining bank property because of reasons relating to the U.C.C. We don't think you even need to go that far.   We think it's sufficient to say that in these third-party cases, what you're obtaining is the property of somebody else.   And that doesn't mean that it's not a crime, and it doesn't even mean that it's not a Federal crime.   It simply means it's a Section 513 crime. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I understand that.   But -- but if you accept the government's view-- "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --of how these third-party cases ought to -- ought to be resolved, you have to get into the U.C.C., don't you. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " I don't know.   I mean, maybe they can -- they're the better people to answer that question for you.   But I think that, at least to finish the answer to Justice Alito, use of an altered check which says -- when you've written, you know, your name on the check rather than the person who authored it, is an attempt to deceive a bank.   We don't disagree with that.   And so then the question in these third-party cases is: Are you attempting to obtain property of the bank?   And we don't think that the U.C.C. comes into that.   It's just a simple common sense thing that a DVD player on Target's shelves is not property owned by or in the custody or control of a bank.   And so-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " How does it work -- how does it work if you have Mr. Crook, Mr. Crook has a bank account at Bank of America, he has $32 in it.   He writes a check for 5,000.   He sees somebody on the street whom he vaguely knows and says, here, take my check; go to the bank; give me $200 or give me 1,000.   Now, he's got the money from Mr. Smith.   He didn't obtain money from the bank.   It was Mr. Smith who did or did not go into the bank to get the money.   Does that fall within the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --No.   I mean, what that is is a typical bad check case.   It's the equivalent-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It wouldn't fall within the statute at all.   In fact -- in other words, have we got some cases on that? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --We don't have this Court's cases.   I mean-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, no.   This is not good, but I mean, you know, what you tried -- you didn't get the money from the bank.   What you did was just write a false check, knowing that in all likelihood the guy you give the check to is going to go right to the bank and get the money.   Now, I just wonder is there some authority as to whether that falls within these statutes or not. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --So the government has brought those kinds of not-sufficient-funds cases.   Ordinarily, it goes down somewhat differently, that you've presented the check that you know is going to bounce to a merchant, not to some guy in the street.   And the government's theory is that thereby you're obtaining bank property.   But most of the cases say that that's not actually bank fraud because you're not intending to deceive a bank.   And that's perfectly fine. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It wouldn't matter.   Look, I don't think you have to -- when you say \u2036 intend \u2033, \u2036 intend \u2033 can encompass a known but undesired consequence of an intentional act.   And so you may not care -- you couldn't care less when the money comes from the bank or not, but you know that the bank is likely to pay it. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " But-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So therefore, you have the requisite intent.   But what I'm trying to figure out here is what's the case law on what should be a very common situation.   If you give it to a third party, your fake check, insufficient funds.   You just want the money from the third party.   But you know the bank is likely to honor it. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Well, if -- if I can quibble with that last piece of the sentence.   Ordinarily, if you give a check that goes to a bank and there's not sufficient funds, they bounce the check.   They don't honor it.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   Try two-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " That's certainly been my experience.   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --Try two -- two different paths here.   Path A, he believes that the bank will honor Smith's, his check, when presented by Jones.   I got my names mixed up. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Mr. Crook believes that the bank will honor his check when Mr. Smith presents it.   And the second is the one Justice Scalia said, is being sophisticated about these matters, Mr. Crook believes that the bank will never own -- never, never pay the check when presented by Smith.   I just want to know the state of the law on those two situations. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " So the state of the law -- and there's only a handful of these not-sufficient-fund cases is that most of the circuits have said they do not fall within the statute.   The ones that have said that they do, it's usually because the defendant has some -- told some additional lie to the bank.   They've opened the account under a false name, for example.   And so that's the state of law.   This Court in United States v. Williams, though, said we should go to great lengths-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What is the thinking of those courts? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --What's that? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What's the thinking of those courts?   What's the rationale? "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " So the rationale is that in a case where you submit -- I guess they have two.   Some of them are applying the risk of loss test and say that there's not a sufficient risk of loss.   I believe some of them are saying that there's no intent to defraud the bank there because the target of the fraud-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And the courts don't hold this way, but hold, as the court did below, that it's an intent to deceive anyone so long as the scheme is-- "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K. Russell", "text": " --Yeah.   Those -- I don't know that this case has come up in those circuits, but I think the answer is quite clear that those circuits would say they're covered.   But in United States v. Williams, this Court said we should go to great lengths to avoid interpreting a Federal criminal statute to criminalize Federally every insufficient funds check case. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You come back to those general statements, you do have the language of the statutes which favors you this question.   But I guess the theory would simply be where Mr. Crook gives him a bad check, to Mr. Smith, he couldn't care less whether Smith presents it to the bank, and he, as far as he's fairly sophisticated, thinks probably Smith won't present it to the bank.   He may to an insurance company or something and, therefore, he did not either obtain or try to obtain or believe he would obtain money from the bank. "}, {"speaker": "Kevin K.

Yang", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Congress drafted Section 1344 with two separate clauses, each of which serves a distinct function.   The first clause targets schemes to defraud a bank.   That requires intent that the scheme have the purpose of defrauding a bank.   Clause (2) -- and this is at page 5a of the government's brief, you can see the structural difference quite plainly.   Clause (2) targets schemes to obtain property that's either owned by or under the custody or control of a bank.   And Congress enacted these broad disjunctive clauses in response to this Court's decision in Maze as well as in Williams, which had curtailed the Government's ability to prosecute precisely these types of fraud. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Mr. Yang, your interpretation of the statute goes far beyond Maze.   Maze was something with a fraudulent credit card or forged check or something like that, but if I understand your interpretation of the statute, you know, if I sell a painting to somebody and I represent it to be by a famous artist and in fact I've just made it in my kitchen, and that person pays me with a check and it's a perfectly valid check, it's a good check, the fraud is obviously as to the person who's just bought the painting.   It has nothing to do with the bank.   But your interpretation would cover that case as well. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " That is correct.   Our understanding of the text, and the reason why that is the case is because Congress specified in clause (2) that the scheme to obtain money or property from the bank has to be by means of a false or fraudulent pretense, but it doesn't specify to whom that false or fraudulent pretense must be made.   Now, we understand that that sweeps in broader than what Maze-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And it's just a little bit peculiar, right?

Yang", "text": " --Well, we think that the text suggests that what Congress was doing was enacting a broad prophylactic, because what Congress was addressing, remember, were situations where this Court had construed narrowly statutes which addressed situations like this where banks were the inherent second-line victims, and so what Congress wanted to avoid is-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But here the bank is not the victim.

Congress was trying to get away from that type of inquiry.   They said, look, if the scheme has the intent of obtaining property either owned by or in the custody or control of the bank, so that means it can either be controlled by the bank, its own property or custody, property it's holding, or it's in the custody or control of others, but it's owned by the bank, a very broad coverage.

You could read, in light of the history and in light of what Congress's main intent was here, to read the statute as saying, ah, Congress actually in clause 2 was concerned with the specific type of means, that is the means that are directed to the bank.   And the reason I think this is far superior than what Petitioner suggests is because we are at least construing silence in the statute.   Congress specifically addressed intent already in clause 1, that is intent to defraud a bank, which is what Petitioner says clause 2 does.   But clause 2 says there's intent to obtain money or property from the bank.   There's no reason to run over Congress's choice about what types of schemes have to be intended in order to achieve this result.   Again, this is our fallback position-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --If -- if we adopt your fallback position, does (2) do anything that (1) doesn't do?

Yang", "text": " --Both clauses, actually, under our fallback or our main position cover things that the others will not.   And I'll give you two examples.   On clause 1, clause 1 covers what's called bare check kiting, where you write a check, it hasn't sufficient funds, you withdraw the money, then you write another check to cover it and another check and you play the float.   Nine courts of appeals have addressed this question.   All of them have concluded that it falls under clause 1.   Six of them have concluded it doesn't fall under clause 2, and the additional three court of appeals that have criminal jurisdiction in either unpublished or in dictum have suggested agreement.   So it's pretty well established check kiting falls under (1), not (2).   With respect to (2), it covers schemes like this, where you can argue maybe you didn't intend to defraud the bank itself, but you used false or fraudulent means that would inherently go to the bank because of the nature of the means themselves.   Here where you direct a check, it's a financial instrument.   It is ordering a bank to pay money.   It goes to the bank, and one normally intends the natural consequences of their acts.   It goes to the bank in the ordinary course. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Which part of the statute are you interpreting with this limiting principle, the \u2036 obtain \u2033 part?

Yang", "text": " Right.   And I think that there are very sound reasons for doing that and I'll explain why.   First, when you look at the statute, Section 1344, this is on page 5A in the bank frauds -- or the mail fraud statute is 1341 on 2A, they are quite different.   I mean, even when we just look at the statutory structure alone, Congress broke these clauses up, put them on different lines, numbered them, indented them equally.

Congress modeled -- it's certainly true that Congress modeled the bank fraud statute on the mail fraud statute.   But that doesn't mean that Congress wanted the two statutes to be coterminous.   In fact, Congress not only expressed its understanding that these were dysjunctive for the various structural reasons, which I think are inescapable from the text.   But also Congress modified the text itself.   Congress didn't simply say a scheme to defraud.   It requires a scheme to defraud a financial institution.   Congress did not say a scheme to obtain money or property.   It specified that it's not only property of the bank, owned by the bank; it is property under the bank's custody that the bank doesn't own and bank -- property that the bank owns, but is not even under its custody or control, it's under the custody or control of others.   This is a different statute, of course modeled on the mail fraud statute, but it's different.   And Congress I don't think in 1984 could have been more clear about its intent to make these two provisions, that is the intent to defraud and the intent to obtain provisions, distinct based on the choices that it made in text.   It's just, I think, impossible to read the text and come away with the conclusion that in 1984 what Congress intended, regardless of what happened in the mail fraud statute in 1987, that Congress intended that, or notwithstanding the only reading of \u2036 or \u2033 in this context that makes any textual sense, since it's not even defended in the textual argument on the other side, that Congress meant that \u2036 or \u2033 in that structure to mean anything but \u2036 or \u2033.   That is, a dysjunctive, two separate clauses having independent meaning.   In fact, it would be anomalous to do so because Section (2) covers, for instance, bank-owned property that's not under the custody or the control of the bank.   So why would you intend to defraud the bank when you're trying to really get it from the custodian of the bank's property?   The idea would be that the means obtained, at the very least, would probably be directed to the custodian of the property, not -- which is not always the bank under clause 2.

If you look at the checks here, the ones that he got caught for, not the ones that he might have washed and dried, weren't artfully done.   But some still go through.

I mean, we cited a case in our brief in which the government actually succeeded in prosecuting someone for an altered check under Section 513.   I don't understand the argument that checks aren't encompassed within 513.   We've reproduced the language at 10-A of the blue brief.   And what it says is that it criminalizes the use of a forged security.   And it defines \u2036 forged \u2033 to mean altered.   It defines \u2036 security \u2033 to mean check.   And then it has to be a forged security of an organization.   And it defines \u2036 organization \u2033 to mean any legal entity other than a government established or organized for any purpose and includes any corporation, company, association, firm, et cetera.   I just don't understand what the argument is that Section 513 doesn't cover some species of altered checks.   But at the very least, if you thought that Congress must have intended to Federally criminalize use of all altered checks, it's an easier interpretation to say that 513 covers it than the bank fraud statute.   The government's argument here today makes utterly clear how broad the Federal bank fraud statute will be if you adopt their interpretation.   They're going -- it encompasses the fake Renoir example and all of the ones in our briefs and it includes every not-sufficient-funds case.   And -- and the government acknowledges-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could you please tell me why -- what your objections are to the \u2036 by means of limiting principle \u2033 the government gives as an alternative?

It is a limitation on what the -- the statute says.   Any false representation, then they say no, only those false representations that would foreseeably go to a bank and might fool them into paying a check.   Second, it doesn't do any useful work because all it does is -- the only difference between their fallback position and intent to defraud a bank is two things.   One is it permits them to bring cases in these third-party altered check cases, and we've argued we don't think that those fall under the statute anyway.   But even if you think that they do, the much easier thing to say is they fall under the statute.   Intent to require -- you know, defraud a bank is required, but the use of the altered check is sufficient evidence. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

So if you're choosing between our test and their test, both tests allow prosecutions of paradigmatic fraud cases.   Both cases, both tests eliminate the Renoir example.   But their test permits -- the only difference, practical difference, is their case facilitates prosecution in these third-party cases that we don't think are covered by the statute anyway, but even if there are, you don't have to adopt this extra textual interpretation.   Instead-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But I don't understand how, if the falsehood is made to Target, who gives the person the DVD off the shelf, how you prove that that's an intent to defraud the bank as opposed to defraud Target.

And the government raises -- you know, the government never likes to have to prove intent.   But the government raises these theoretical difficulties in proving intent, but it hasn't shown that this actually ever arises.   In fact, the government routinely convicts people in circumstances like this case, even in circuits where intent to defraud a bank is required.   It's just they didn't try to do that here because they didn't ask the jury to make that finding.   In addition, the difficulty of their test is it's just plain strange.   They say you should adopt their test because Congress didn't care about intent to defraud a bank.   Then they adopt a rule that looks very much like the kind of rule you would adopt if you thought Congress cared about intent to defraud a bank.   It's simply substituting some circumstantial evidence that one could argue to a jury shows intent to defraud a bank and saying that's all the government has to prove. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

We say that you can read the statute to require intent to deceive the bank because there's a statutory silence.   And then the government has to prove intent to obtain bank property.
