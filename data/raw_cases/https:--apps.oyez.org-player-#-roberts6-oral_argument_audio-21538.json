[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-5683, Dorsey v. United States, and 11-5721, Hill v. United States.   Mr. Eberhardt. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen E. Eberhardt", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:   The judges of the Seventh Circuit are unanimous in their belief that this case raises a good question.   And, of course, that good question is: Why would Congress want district courts to continue to impose sentences that were universally viewed as unfair and racially discriminatory?   My colleague sitting on the other side of the podium, I submit to the Court, does not answer that question.   Petitioners feel that the answer to that question can be found in the text of the Fair Sentencing Act.   And while we admit that there is no express answer, the text gives us the required fair implication.   The text in section 8, the text in section 10-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me.   Is a fair implication enough?   You're talking here about a repealer, essentially, of an earlier provision, section 109.   And our cases uniformly say that it -- it has to be clear implication, unquestionable implication.   Do you think this is really clear and unquestionable? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen E. Eberhardt", "text": " --No, it is not, but the standard from this Court, Justice Scalia, is fair implication, and it has been ever since Great -- the Great Northern case.

Eberhardt", "text": " But, again, ever since 1908, that's a standard that this Court has not accepted.   And this is based on the provision, the well-settled provision, that an earlier Congress cannot bind a later Congress. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Oh, and I understand that.   But presumably -- we also have the proposition that Congress, when it enacts legislation, knows the law.   They would have known section 109 required an express statement if they wanted to apply the change retroactively.   So why shouldn't we hold them to that standard? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen E. Eberhardt", "text": " The answer is no, I don't believe that Congress felt that that was the standard.   Again relying on this Court's jurisprudence that said you give us text and if we are able to find that the fair implication and the intent of Congress through that fair implication is that this new statute applies, because an earlier Congress cannot bind the newer Congress-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

You're correct, a clear or a necessary, but Petitioners contend that not only do we meet the fair implication standard-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, that's a different question.

And, therefore, whatever it said about what is necessary for repeal of 109 was purely dictum, because it held that 109 was not repealed.

"}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --So that's true of all of the cases that you -- the cases -- you pointed to two or three that use \"fair implication\".   The Court in all those cases found that there was no fair implication, so that 109 governed.   Isn't -- isn't that so?   That was true in Marrero.   It was true in Northern Securities. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen E. Eberhardt", "text": " In Marrero, the primary holding was based on the fact that there was a specific provision for nonretroactivity. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But in none of the cases that used the fair implication language did the Court say: And, therefore, the old statute no longer governs.

It said it a few times.   But in application, it always came out the same way. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen E. Eberhardt", "text": " Well, in application, when the Court applied this in Marcello, when they were weighing the language of the Administrative Procedure Act as opposed to the language of the Immigration and Nationality Act, I think the Court made clear, as it went through the statute there, that there was a fair implication.   And then once you get to the point of fair implication, it necessarily means that there is some kind of an ambiguity.   And then the Court followed up saying that we then did look to the legislative history, and the legislative history backs up the implication that we did find. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But that was not true of the 109 cases.   You don't have a 109 case that says the standard is fair implication, and, therefore, the old statute is not enforced. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen E. Eberhardt", "text": " Directly?

Section 8 is all over the briefs, but I have it in the government's gray brief at page 10a.   This is the section that directs the Sentencing Commission to promulgate new guidelines and to exercise its emergency authority -- and I'm going to quote here --   \"to make such conforming amendments to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines as the Commission deems necessary to achieve consistency with other guidelines provisions. \"   --and here's the critical phrase -- \"applicable law\".   That phrase, 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act, which are the provisions that increased the thresholds of quantities necessary to trigger the mandatory minimum sentences. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " That's fine.   But -- but it -- they apply that applicable law to those, as you say, admittedly few people who have been prosecuted, convicted, and are now being sentenced under that applicable law.

"}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " --Well, Justice Scalia, I want to put this in the structural context of the Sentencing Reform Act.   The Sentencing Reform Act directs courts to apply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines that is in effect on the day of sentencing.   It's not a time of offense rule; it's a time of sentencing rule.   And there -- that means that everybody who comes before the sentencing court after the date of the Fair Sentencing Act when the new guidelines are in place will have those guidelines applied to those defendants.   Those guidelines are supposed to be conformed to applicable law.   The only applicable law that there could be is the new mandatory minimum standard.

The -- the law applicable to pre -- pre-statute offenses continues to be the prior law, and the applicable law to offenses that have occurred after the enactment date is -- is the-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " But that would mean, Justice Scalia, that the guidelines would not be conformed to applicable law for the defendants who are sentenced after the FSA.   They would be conformed to inapplicable law.   And Congress knew when it set up section 3553(a) that the guidelines that would be applied are the ones that are in force at the time of sentencing. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So why -- why 90 days?   I mean, the Commission basically just took the ratio under the new Act and applied it, didn't they, throughout?   They took the mandatory minimum formula that had been changed and changed it throughout the -- the sentencing provisions? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R. Dreeben", "text": " Well, it was a little bit more complex than that, because what -- what the FSA did was two things: it lowered of the mandatory minimums by increasing the crack thresholds, and it targeted role in the offense of the defendant for increased sentencing and mitigating factors for decreased sentencing.   And the Commission had to translate that into new guidelines.   It acted quickly.   It was told to act as soon as practicable.   It was entirely possible under the statute, and probably would have been desired by Congress, that new guidelines would have gone into effect on August 4th.   At that point the only people in front of the sentencing court would have been pre-FSA offenders. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes, but how -- how many are we talking about?

And it wanted those guidelines to be conformed to applicable law.   And it is very strange to say that it wanted new guidelines in effect to be conformed to inapplicable law such that there would be the incongruous result that the new guidelines that finally fixed this egregious problem in the criminal justice system would be irrelevant for many defendants because they would still be living under the 100-to-1 racially disparate effect of the guidelines, of these-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Dreeben, almost any law that repeals a prior penalty is doing so because the legislature determines that that prior penalty is unjust in some way, because why do you eliminate a penalty unless you think it is necessary to do so and that it is injust or unjust in some way?

And once you do that, give us emergency authority so that we can put new guidelines into place that will work hand-in-glove with the new mandatory minimums, as the Chief Justice explained, so that all defendants who come before the Court will not be subject to the discredited crack policy that Congress had repealed.

The Sentencing Commission, as the government points out, went to Congress again and again and again to say we don't agree with this, this makes no sense.   And for 20 years, Congress could not bring itself to change it because there was no agreement on the part of the lawmakers that the public policy was that easy.   And the fact is you have a whole assortment of bills that were considered by Congress in the last several sessions.   For people who believe legislative history is significant, they're all very instructive.   Most of them did a variant of the same thing.   Most of them have very identical language, even some of the language that's at issue here.   They had different proposals.   There was one for 24: 1, another one -- there were many one to one.   It was clear that Congress couldn't bring itself to an agreement as to what the right answer was.

And what everybody understood was that if that were the case, if the new guidelines and the old mandatory minimums sort of -- both applied together, it would lead to ridiculous disparities in the way people were sentenced.   And so the question is, once having decided to do this, can't we assume that Congress decided to do it? "}, {"speaker": "Miguel A. Estrada", "text": " No.   Let me give three answers to that.   I think, you know, one of the fundamental points here is that a premise of the law is to treat like people alike.   And people who committed the same offense on the same date and may have done so with each other we would expect to get comparable punishment if they were comparable situated as to criminal history, and the -- that the solution that's being urged undermines that even though that is exactly what section 109 says.

But the point about the guidelines and statute working together, wasn't there a time when the Sentencing Guidelines -- they wanted to do away with this distinction and Congress said, no, Sentencing Commission, you can't do it, you can't do it to the guidelines when we don't do it to the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Miguel A. Estrada", "text": " There are two points about the guidelines that I think we have to keep in mind, Justice Ginsburg.   The first one is that they are guidelines, especially in the world after Booker, which is the world that confronted Congress in 2010.   They are guides that must be considered by the judge to inform judicial discretion.   So in the nature of the guidelines there is nothing inherent in saying that we must have new ones that also implies a new obligation of statutory law to people whose offense conduct occurred earlier.   The second aspect of it is that it has been part of the nature of a guidelines system for two decades that it has been consistent with the decision by Congress in some areas to constrain the exercise of discretion with mandatory minimums.   And this Court has recognized that in multiple occasions in Kimbrough, in Neal, in DePierre, any number of cases, and the guidelines themselves in section 5G1 recognize that the mandatory minimum may trump a lower guideline.   So when you have a long history in 2010 of rulings from this Court acknowledging, as you said in your opinion in Kimbrough, that this may lead to cliffs, et cetera, and you also have a recognition by the Commission itself that they have to integrate this reality of sentencing law into their own guidelines, there is very little basis for an inference that Congress in providing new guidelines would have contemplated that the effective date of the law would change-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But Congress did say: Sentencing Commission, you conform your new guidelines to applicable law.   The applicable law has got to be the new law, because if it were the old law, there is nothing to conform.   There is nothing that they need to change.   It's only that this section (a)(2) makes sense only if the applicable law is the new law.   Otherwise the Commission doesn't have to do anything to achieve consistency. "}, {"speaker": "Miguel A. Estrada", "text": " --Justice Ginsburg, I am prepared to admit for purposes of this case, and I think it's probably the right answer, that Congress intended that the guidelines had to line up with the penalties of the FSA.   The question is cui bono: For whose benefit.   And Congress clearly contemplated for some of the reasons that you outlined that the system in the change in the statute would not do any good for people coming to be sentenced 6 months later if they still had higher guidelines.   But much has been said here today about the 90-day window.   The 90-day window is irrelevant.   The really relevant window is the comparison of what the new guidelines would have been and when they would have come out absent the emergency authority.   Absent any emergency authority, new guidelines would have come out November 1, 2011, which would have been a good 15 months after the passage of the FSA.   And even under the government-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Mr. Estrada, even without the guideline amendment, for those defendants who committed crimes after the effective date of this Act, they would not have had -- new offense, not old offense -- if the day after this Act they committed the offense, they wouldn't have had a mandatory minimum that required their imprisonment for a certain amount of time, because the Act had already done away with the mandatory minimum, correct?

So those people would not have been bound to a mandatory minimum.

I mean, one of the interesting aspects about these cases is that one of the Petitioners, for example, got the benefit of being sentenced at the time that the post-FSA guidelines, the new emergency guidelines, provided a sentencing range of him of 110 to 137.   That's -- that's Mr. Hill.   These are the new guidelines.   He was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 10, which is on the lower end of that guideline.   The only reason that case is in the U.S. Supreme Court is because, even after the new statute, the judge was of a mind that he wanted to use a one-to-one ratio.   And that's why there is a controversy There.   But that highlights, you know, the point that I am trying to make and that the Court made in Kimbrough, which is that the mandatory minimums tend to enforce a species of uniformity in a world in which the guidelines are advisory, and they do help uphold, you know, the principle that people that committed comparable offenses will have some lost comparability.

Breyer", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Miguel A. Estrada", "text": " It had to be -- you know, the penalty that deals with supervised release.   And Congress had gone from a world in which a violation of supervised release had to be subject to a mandatory sentence, to a world in which the statute had been changed, to say that it was up in the discretion of the judge.   By the time the offender came to court, he had violated his supervised release.   And his argument, which was actually a lot more plausible than this one, was that before he violated, the law had changed, and he was now in effect now coming to the court for a new sentencing.   Which is exactly analogous to this.   The Second Circuit had no trouble in saying that a routine application of section 109 killed that claim because the offense was considered completed at the time it was committed.   And, therefore, this was a -- a claim that simply was not tenable in light of the language of section 109.   And that, too, is a -- is a case where somebody could have said the law that now applies is the one that applies to my new sentencing under the new applicable guidelines.

There's a person who has 4.99 grams of crack cocaine.

And the Court accepted that that was the case.   It said, yes, this leads to cliffs.   It leads to a lack of a straight line in between all of the possible penalties.   We accept all of that.   It is an artifact of the fact that Congress at certain points, but not on a continuous line, has chosen to constrain sentencing discretion with the rough tool of a quantity threshold.   It is all set out in the Kimbrough case. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Now, when Judge Easterbrook talked about this anomaly -- and he, of course, adopted the position that you adopted.

I guess the question I would ask you is: Can you do better than Judge Easterbrook?   Can you find an earthly reason for why Congress would have wanted to create this weird halfway system in which you if you have 4-1/2 grams of cocaine, one rule applies, but if you have 5 grams, another rule applies?

One of the reasons why I think, you know, the Court should accept that Congress contemplated new guidelines but not necessarily take up, you know, the government's view that this is actually called for by the very end of that section, applicable law, is that the government looks at this as a world in which Congress has now intervened and in effect compelled a -- a more linear function of sentencing.   So that, henceforth, I guess the Commission has to conform to the 18-to-1 ratio, and it would no longer be open to the Commission, for example, to do what it did in 2007, which is we changed our mind; there's a mandatory minimum that constrains us, but in light of the most recent scholarship, we think the ratio should be 16 to 1.   And -- and one of the reasons why I am reluctant to urge you to accept, you know, the government's construction, which I can see how they would be helped by in future cases, is that I think it's very implausible for Congress to have considered this, as they say, the centerpiece of the statute and have -- have it be the last depending clause of section 8. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Wait, wait.   This is -- just tell me if maybe the light is dawning, and maybe I'm just at the same question Justice Kagan asked.   Think of before the statute.

So they were tough amendments, so the law didn't require it-- "}, {"speaker": "Miguel A. Estrada", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --to produce consistency.   Now the statute's passed.   Now we have some of the pre-Act offenders.   Because of the two sets of things, section 8 on the one hand and the 3553(g) on the other, in respect to those people who were not governed by the mandatory minimum previously but were subject to the then-conforming amendments, now will have to be subject to new conforming amendments that conform to the new thing.   And that -- because that'll have to be because of the combination of the two sections that Mr. Dreeben read, the -- all right.   Now, if that's so, we get to the cliffs that Justice Kagan is talking about.   And if I'm right so far, we're now back at the probation officer example, and it's so odd and so peculiar that it is not just a fair -- do you see where I'm going? "}, {"speaker": "Miguel A.

And so whereas there are mandatory minima that are troublesome and give rise to cliffs, there are also occasions in which the Commission is able to do things that are not consistent with the statute.   Let me give one example that was mentioned by the Court in DePierre.   As the statute was interpreted in DePierre, cocaine base is cocaine base; it gets you a mandatory minimum if it's chemically based.   The Commission thinks that you only get the enhanced penalties if the cocaine base happens to be crack.   Similarly under the Neal case, you get to weigh the carrier medium for the LSD, but, you know, the Commission thinks that you give it a presumed weight that is probably lower than the actual medium.   In both of those cases, the Commission comes up with guidelines that are lower than the methodology that is contemplated under the statutory analysis.   Were you to adopt the applicable law on the assumption that the Congress has now dictated that these things have to line up and never to have cliffs again because they are bad, you could end up having untoward consequences as to what it is that the Commission can do in the future in order to deal with other inequalities-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Mr. Estrada, I'm not sure I follow-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

It is possible that the judge would intervene and use Booker discretion, but not necessarily so.   And the alternative world which Congress did give us is you change the guidelines as soon as you can; if you come to the bar of the court with a pre-FSA offense, it doesn't matter, because the new guidelines, like every guidelines book since the beginning, say that if a mandatory minimum applies, that controls over the then-current guidelines, which is one of the fundamental reasons why the alternative view of the world and the alternative rule of construction the government proffers makes no sense.   As a prosecutory construction matter and for those members in the Court who give weight to legislative history, I will point out that the emergency authority section that the government thinks is dispositive on this point was in every version of this bill -- Senate 1711, Senate 1383, you know, the House versions that they cite -- even when those statutes, as Justice Scalia pointed -- I'm sorry -- as Justice Alito pointed out earlier, provided an effective date for the new statute of 6 months hence.   It is-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, along those lines, could I -- could I ask you this question, which is intended to explore the -- the issue whether the argument about bringing the guidelines into consistency with applicable law doesn't assume the -- the answer that is -- that one attempts to get from it.   Suppose the -- the -- the Fair Sentencing Act said expressly, this applies only -- the new mandatory minimums apply only to post-Act offenders, but it also contained a provision that says the Sentencing Commission has to bring the guidelines into consistency with applicable law.   I assume there what they would have to do would be to say that the new guidelines apply only to post-enactment offenders, so that the Fair Sentencing Act would trump this previous provision in the Sentencing Reform Act.   Wouldn't that be correct? "}, {"speaker": "Miguel A. Estrada", "text": " --Correct.   And I think that that would be true here as well.   And the reason why I was highlighting the earlier bills is because each and every one of them had the same, almost word for word, \"conform with applicable law\" emergency authority.   All of them uniformly said the new mandatory minimums will not apply for another 6 months after the enactment.   As a logical proposition, if Congress thought that the identical language made sense to bring the guidelines into conformity with a law that would not take into -- that would not kick in for another 6 months, having it kick in sooner does not have any more logical import in saying that therefore, you know, the guidelines now mean that previous offenses get a different sentence. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But could I understand what you are saying, Mr. Estrada?   Because if Justice Alito is right, then the new guidelines that the Sentencing Commission has in fact promulgated should not be being applied right now to those who committed crimes before the enactment date.   And that's not what's happening now on the ground, is it? "}, {"speaker": "Miguel A. Estrada", "text": " Justice Kagan, it is not happening in that manner, because the guidelines, every book of the guidelines, I believe since 1987, which is the first one, has had, like, 5G1.1, which says these are the guidelines, but 5G tells you if a mandatory minimum applies, for whatever reason, you apply that and that becomes the mandatory sentence.   And so there has never been any reason to have two sets of guidelines to account for cliffs or andatory minimums, because every guidelines book has had a built-in solution to that problem, which is we understand that there are cliffs, we understand that there is a world of mandatory minimums; we can't fix those, this is our guideline sentence.   If somehow, for some reason -- because it occurred, you know, before or whatever -- there is a mandatory minimum that applies, the guidelines say the mandatory minimum becomes the guideline sentence.   So in that sense, a Congress that knew the law would understand that saying you have to have new guidelines had no logical force in saying that therefore the effective date of mandatory minimums or any other factor that bore on the application of mandatory minimums would be changed.
