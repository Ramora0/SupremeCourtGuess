[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1036, Henderson v. Shinseki.   Ms. Blatt. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The Federal circuit's decision in this case forecloses judicial review when the very disability for which a veteran seeks benefits prevents the veteran from filing a timely appeal with the Veterans Court.   That decision is wrong, and for three reasons the court of appeals erred in holding that the deadline at issue in this case is jurisdictional.   First, the statute contains no clear indication that the deadline is jurisdictional.   Rather, the text and structure points away from a jurisdictional reading.   Second, the deadline that applies to disabled and largely uncounseled veterans seeking their first day in court is not the type of deadline that Congress would be expected to rank as jurisdictional.   And third, a jurisdictional reading would render some of the most disabled of veterans the least likely to obtain benefits and would treat veterans worse off than almost all litigants in our federal system. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Ms. Blatt, you do have a substantial hurdle to contend with in this Court's decision in Bowles v. Russell, which seemed to say if you have a time limit and it's statutory, it is mandatory and jurisdictional.   So here, we have a time limit set by statute, not by rule, and why doesn't -- why isn't that dispositive? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Because neither this Court's decision in Bowles nor any other decision by this Court holds that this type of an appeal from a pro-claimant and non-adversarial proceeding to a court of first review clearly speaks in jurisdictional terms, notwithstanding the lack of a jurisdictional label. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Gee, I thought Bowles was a nice, clear case.   I mean, you could always find some distinction in the next case, and I thought the object of Bowles was to say if it's a limit on appeal, it's jurisdictional.   That would -- and that's, I gather, what the Federal circuit took it to mean.   And I would have done that if I was down there, probably. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " I can understand why maybe the Federal circuit did it, because of the one statement that the Court, I think, took out of context.   But this Court's decision in Bowles didn't purport to extend to any statute, no matter what the statute said or what the context it arose in, and the most closely analogous context of an appeal of agency action to a court of first review is a Social Security context.   And even if you don't think that that context is directly on point, then the historical backdrop at most would be inconclusive, and that hardly would rise to the type of-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Doesn't the Social Security context -- it doesn't speak of an appeal, does it?   It talks of a civil action. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --That's right.   I mean, it-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I mean, you're right that there is -- you know, there is a parallel in what's going on, but the statute does not call it an appeal.   It calls it bringing a civil action to challenge the decision. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Right, and there is nothing inherently jurisdictional about the word \"appeal\".   And Justice Scalia, if Congress that passed this statute wanted to pick up on the jurisdictional rule under 28 2107, presumably it would have written a statute that looks something like that statute with the safety valves.   Of course, when a -- all litigants, civil litigants who are appealing a district court judgment to a Court of Appeals, they have a jurisdictional deadline, but the district court can extend it for good cause or excusable neglect or when the party lacks notice of an adverse judgment or, importantly, the Federal rules of appellate procedure.   Here's a situation when a litigant timely files his appeal, but does so in the wrong form.   In this statute Congress knew how to incorporate the jurisdictional rule of Bowles.   It did so in a separate provision of the statute in 7292(a).   It said when a litigant wants to go from the Veterans Court and appeal that decision to the Federal circuit, the litigant has to follow the time and the manner prescribed for appealing district court judgments to Court of Appeals. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And that is jurisdictional, 7292? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Yes.   And interestingly, it also goes on to say if you want to appeal to this Court, you have to apply for certiorari.   So Congress-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm not sure why Congress would have actually known the difference that we established in Bowles, because when it passed this statute, it was before Bowles, wasn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what to read of its knowledge of Bowles, whether it meant jurisdiction or not, is a bit of a fiction, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " No.   I think what's important is that Bowles is relying on a series of decisions that had nothing to do with the word \"notice of appeal\", of course, because they were dealing with cases involving writs of error and petitions for a writ of certiorari.   It was all in the context of court-to-court appeals.   Bowles doesn't even mention agency appeal of agency action to a court of first review. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what's the rule?   Justice Scalia said those seem to establish a sensible, clear rule, which is if Congress uses the word \"notice of appeal\", it intends a jurisdictional restriction.   That appears to be the rule that Justice Scalia articulated.   What would be your rule or test now to determine Congress's purpose?   What -- what of our cases would you point to that establishes different-- "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " The rule of Reed Elsevier, which was a unanimous decision which says -- and it was written by the same author of Bowles -- that all the decisions are consistent.   You require a clear statement of jurisdictional intent, and in Bowles, this Court had read the type of limitation that was at issue in Bowles as to clearly speak in jurisdictional terms, notwithstanding a label.   Here, you have-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --I'm not sure what that distinction is.   I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --You had a century-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What we wrote on was the word \"notice of appeal\" in Bowles, within a historical context. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --I don't think this Court said the word \"notice\".   Notice of appeal is not jurisdictional in the criminal context and Congress used the word \"appeal\" throughout this particular statute in a non-jurisdictional meaning in all the proceedings that go in the agency.   It used the term \"appellant\" and \"review on appeal\".   It's actually called the board of veterans appeal, substantive appeal.   None of those words have \"jurisdictional\".   And if Congress was just thinking of the word 7252(a), and that makes no reference to the 120-day deadline.   And I think in terms of the context, let's -- this is exactly the type of deadline that Congress would be expected to be subject to equitable tolling.   Let me just give you the three reasons-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You would have us make a statute-by-statute determination as to what we think Congress intended whenever it uses the term \"notice of appeal\".   And perhaps that's not a big problem, if there are not a lot of other statutes like this one that use the term \"notice of appeal\" and with respect to which it is not settled whether it is jurisdictional.   Do you have any sense of how many others there might be? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Yeah.   I think I found four that used the term \"notice of appeal\", and it was in connection with the district court, and they weren't even reported cases.   They were very esoteric situations, like an order from the Department of Agriculture.   I mean, maybe the government has different.   What you mostly see is the Hobbs Act context, where you are talking about either an organic statute or 28 U.S.C. 2344, which is just a simple petition for review.   That doesn't even use the word \"notice of appeal\".   So this case is not going to dictate a whole lot, except for the veterans context, where not only do you have the standard lack of indication that this is not a jurisdictional, but you have the unique features in that Congress established this Court to open the door to veterans seeking disability benefits, and it would just conflict with that purpose to, at the same time, shut the door when the veteran's disability prevents him from getting to the courthouse. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Although that -- although that would happen when he appeals from the -- from the veterans' appeals court, right? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Yes, but that points out the irony: He's in better off shape if he appeals to the court of appeals, because there, there's -- at least there's important exceptions.   The government's position assumes that no matter what the circumstances were -- and remember, a lot of these cases, the veteran is actually timely filing his appeal; he mistakenly files in the Veterans Administration rather than the Veterans Court -- and the government assumes that these uncounseled veterans are simply out of time and out of luck with no exception. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " How much time does 7292 give to go from Veterans Court to the Federal circuit? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " It says you have to follow the exact time and procedure that is set forth in the process for appealing a United States District Court decision to the United States courts of appeals, so it is the procedures under 28 U.S.C. 2107. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But this one to get to the Veterans Court is 120 days, which is a lot of time.   Do you know of any other time limit that is that long? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, sure.   I mean, the statute of limitations in Zipes, which is 180 days to file a charge with the EEOC.   But in the veterans context-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " No, for appeal.   For appeal.   Do you know of any other appeal statute-- "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Yes, the veteran's context.   This is a blink of an eye in the veteran's context.   The veteran is given an entire year -- not 120 days, a year -- after an initial decision comes down from a regional office to decide whether to appeal to the boards of veterans' appeals.   And you have to keep in mind that this is the type of extra time we are talking about.   An extra 30 to 60 days would be an extremely poor and unlikely means for Congress to address the type of situation where equitable tolling might be needed, which is either because the secretary has held onto the notice of appeal until after the 120 days and then tells the veteran, or the veteran has some devastating mental illness and has difficulty with processing deadlines and dealing with concepts. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --Well, the latter I can understand, but I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for -- I mean, when he loses below he gets a notice that says specifically he has to file an appeal with this Court, doesn't it?   Doesn't it say that? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Yes, and it says-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So he sends it -- he sends it to the VA instead of to this Court? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Well, it is a -- you can look it up-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Would equitable tolling even cover that situation?   It would seem to me -- I'd say it told you where to file; you simply didn't follow the instructions. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Not only has the Federal circuit ruled en banc that it does, but this Court's decision in Irwin and in United States v. Young specifically recognized that a classic equitable tolling situation is when there is no prejudice to the other side and the litigant files in the wrong forum.   And you have to keep in mind, there is a Federal rule of appellate procedure on point.   Rule 4(d) says when a litigant mistakenly files his notice of appeal in the court of appeals, that is presumed to be correctly filed in the district court.   And whatever you think about what your -- what an average-type person might see when they see a two page single-spaced form with a lot of legalese, this form is difficult for a lawyer to read, and to expect -- the vast majority of the claimants reading this form are uncounseled and I urge you to read the form.   It doesn't just say: You have 120 days to appeal.   It goes on and on and on telling-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Is that-- "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --It's cited in the Government's brief.   It's got the VA form, and I had to look it up just by punching it in on the Internet.   But whatever you think about the clarity of someone -- of your statute that might be able to understand it, time and time again, veterans file in the wrong forum.   And it's not always just the veterans' fault.   Sometimes the secretary is giving the veteran misleading advice.   We cite cases in our brief, and so do the amici, where the Veterans' Administration is giving the veteran just misleading advice. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Ms. Blatt, you are making -- you said that the closest comparison is in the Social Security, because there's disability benefits in both cases.   Apart from one is commenced by a complaint of -- in the district court, the other, notice of appeal, is there any difference in the brand of rebuke that is -- as I understand, the Social Security review, although it is by the district court, is also on the administrative record. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, it's purely appellate, and district courts always say when they get these things: This is an appeal of the Social Security decision.   But I think the three reasons that I'm trying to get on why this is precisely the type of deadline that Congress would not rank as jurisdictional and would want to be subject to equitable tolling are the -- pretty much the reasons that apply even more so in the veterans' context.   And that is the first: This is an extremely favored class of litigants.   These are veterans who have fought for their country and who are seeking service-connected disability benefits.   This is also the veterans' first opportunity to get to a court, which is true in the Social Security system.   And importantly, the vast majority of veterans go to the court without counsel.   The numbers are over 50 to 70 percent.   And that was true in the Social Security system.   I don't think that-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I appreciate all those points, but counting -- cutting, perhaps, the other way is that it's not a real adversarial system before you get to that stage.   It's a collaborative effort, the Veterans' Administration and the -- the individual. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --That's right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Which seems to me may counterbalance a little bit the fact that the veterans are uncounseled. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, I mean, up until 2006 they were actually barred from having lawyers.   But this is the same thing as the Social Security context, which is what this Court relied on unanimously in Bowen, in holding that it is not jurisdictional, and it is also what this Court relied on in Zipes, is that you wouldn't expect Congress to enact an inflexible, harsh, no exceptions whatsoever jurisdictional deadline when Congress presumably knew that the vast majority of people who would be navigating this system, coming out of this extremely informal adversarial system where the secretary had a duty to actually assist the veteran and then hitting what is then an adversarial system, and you would think that you would want equitable tolling. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --They don't navigate it entirely on the system.   I mean, isn't there usually assistance from a nongovernmental organization such as the American Legion or-- "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Yes, in the Veterans' Administration, not in Veterans' Court.   So 50 to 70 percent. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --That's right.   Do they drop them like a hot potato once the VA portion is over?   They don't counsel about how to file an appeal? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " That's correct, but I wouldn't say they drop them like a hot potato.   These are people who are sitting in the VA and they -- remember, like in this case, it's three years later -- they don't even get notice of the final decision, which is just sent to the veteran.   They don't have any kind of lawyer relationship.   It's like someone at one of the VA offices says: Let me help you, tell you what to do, and then that's it.   So no, they don't practice in Veterans' Court.   They don't say, you know, Here's my card, let's keep in touch.   And it might be three to four years later that a notice is sent to the veteran. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " And you think normally he is not assisted -- he is not assisted by one of these people? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, I know that.   The Veterans' Court's statistics says it's 70 percent.   Pro se.   No lawyer.   And-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I'm not talking about a lawyer.   I'm talking about advice from somebody that's in the American Legion. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --They are still not lawyers, but the veterans' assisted organizations who filed in this case are telling you they don't participate in Veterans' Court.   That's not what they do.   They are set up in the VA system.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I think -- unless I am missing the point of my colleague's question, it's two different issues.   Of course they don't participate in the court.   They are not lawyers.   But it's not clear to me why they wouldn't participate at least in the process of saying, you've got to file your notice and here's where you file it.   Are you saying they don't do that? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --They by and large don't do that, and the veterans' organizations that filed an amicus brief say they also make the same mistake.   They were not lawyers and they often file the wrong forum, too.   But again-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " They do it regularly and they -- every now and then they file it in the wrong place? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Yes.   I mean, half the cases that we end up talking-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I don't see how that works.   You've got somebody there and he has been telling them where to file it and file it and file it, and all of a sudden he tells him to file it someplace else? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Again, as far as I am aware, they don't counsel veterans after they make their final decision. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Earlier you said that they wouldn't even know. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So they don't get notice, only the veterans? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Right.   They wouldn't get notice.   It would be -- someone would have to have some sort of relationship and call that person.   But in this case -- I mean, I can tell you there was no -- the veteran just had his wife and there was no one else involved in the process other than his doctors.   But-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What happens if the veteran doesn't get notice? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Well, he's out of luck, according to the Government.   That's just tough.   But again, thinking about -- and remember that not only is there a clear statement rule in types of jurisdictions, but we have an equally strong canon that veterans' statutes have to be construed liberally in the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What clear statement rule are you talking about? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Just the rule of Reed Elsevier and Arbaugh, that unless a statute clearly speaks in jurisdictional terms-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Yes, I remember that.   I remember that.   I thought that that was a prospective bright-line rule.   It's kind of hard to apply a new bright-line rule retrospectively.   I understood what we said in those cases to be: Look, Congress, we are tired of trying to sort out this ambiguity.   From now on, if you want it to be treated as jurisdictional, tell us it's jurisdictional.   It makes sense prospectively, but it doesn't make sense to do that to statues that were passed before we announced our bright-line preference. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Well, it doesn't sense to say in 1988 Congress was trying to map onto some preexisting structure that didn't exist.   Bowles didn't exist. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No.   I understand changing the subject, but in my question, you invoke the bright-line rule of Arbaugh that the statute should say \"jurisdictional\".   And I'm just saying that only makes sense prospectively. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " I can see your point.   I don't think that that's what Arbaugh intended.   I think it said that when you have a statutory requirement and when it doesn't speak to the jurisdiction of the court, there is no reason to think that it should restrict the jurisdiction of the court.   This doesn't say anything about the court's power. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You have -- in Bowles itself it was from the district court to a court of appeals, and then we have from the court of appeals to this Court, and those two provisions were cited in Bowles, 2107.   And what is the provision for-- "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " 2101(c). "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --2101.   Those, as far as I remember, were the only provisions that were cited. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, and the predecessors called writ of error.   Right, they were -- I mean, this couldn't be further from it.   Congress, when it passed this statute, said: You have 120 days to file your appeal, and then in a whole -- didn't say anything about the jurisdiction.   And a separate version said: Here's the jurisdiction, and we will incorporate some procedural requirements, but we're not even going to mention the 120-day deadline.   And then it goes to great pains to say: 2107 will apply when you appeal from the Veterans' Court to the Federal circuit, and you will have to apply for certiorari.   But to think about what the Government's position is, is that, notwithstanding that criminal defendants and Social Security claimants do not face jurisdictional deadlines, all the civil litigants in our system who do face jurisdictional deadlines can get an extension for good cause, excusable neglect when they don't have notice of an adverse judgment, and the situation is cured when they actually timely file but they mistakenly file with the wrong court. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So whenever we have time limits in the future that do not contain any explicit provision for waiver of failure to meet those time limits, you are asking us to find that all of those are non-jurisdictional? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, all statute of limitations are not jurisdictional.   So there is no question-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, is it a filing requirement?   It's -- it's-- "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --It's an appeal.   It's a requirement for appeal.   Whenever there is an appeal deadline that does not have an exception for -- you know, you -- you can get it extended for 10 days or what-not -- whenever there is no exception, you want us to hold it's not jurisdictional? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --No, of course not.   Like I just said, I don't know of any that even come up, except for -- I think I found four that say \"notice of appeal\".   All these types of cases that you see are dealing with a petition for review of agency action, a la the Hobbs Act context.   So what I'm asking you to hold is that when you have a -- this particular statute, which the text and structure certainly say it's not jurisdictional, it is exactly the -- it is not the type of deadline you would expect it, and it would undermine all of the purposes that Congress set up this court, which was to ensure they have their day in court, they get the benefits they are entitled to, and importantly, to cure the perception that veterans were be -- not being treated the way all other claimants seeking Federal benefits were.   This would completely counter that purpose, to say: Here's a court; we have built it for you, but if you can't get up the courthouse steps, that's too bad.   If your very disability prevents you from filing or you have been abused by the VA -- the VA bureaucracy, you were out of luck and out of court. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Although you are willing to -- to have that happen when there is an appeal from -- from the first appeal, right? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " And here's why, Justice Scalia.   The veteran has had a day in court.   Once he is out of the Veterans' Court, he is like every -- or she is like every other litigant in our Federal system, which -- the deadline applies to the government; the deadline applies to the party -- to any party.   That's 2107, which applies to all civil litigants equally.   They have had their day in court, and if it's in the Hobbs Act context, usually they have had some sort of adversarial court-like proceeding in the administrative agency.   But no decision -- and again, keep in mind there were three decisions in the Social Security context -- no decision has ever said: Pro-claimant, non-adversary appeal to a court of first review is jurisdictional.   So Congress was acting against that backdrop.   And-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And that was -- that was the Federal Circuit's position until Bowles, right?   This was an en banc decision and it overruled two prior cases. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " --Right.   And they did go back and forth, so there was a period of 6 years that they held it was jurisdictional, and then a period of 11 years, the last 11 years, where it has been non-jurisdictional and there has been equitable tolling. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If the veteran is so profoundly disabled that the veteran can't file the notice of appeal within 120 days after the notice of the decision, at what point after the 120-day period would the right to file a notice of appeal be cut off?   Would this go on potentially indefinitely? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " No.   I mean, in adopting equitable tolling by the Federal Circuit for mental disabilities -- that case is Barrett v. Principi on page 9 of our brief -- it goes through how all the sister circuits have dealt with the issue of mental disability in Title VII, in the Social Security system, and -- and how you would deal with that.   But let's take this case, because it's a good example.   The doctor said he was -- he's paranoid schizophrenic, so he is having periods, and to quote the doctor that was submitted to the Veterans' Court, he had episodes of what was basically called psychomotor retardation and total inability to function, and other times he was just simply disorganized, had difficulty with recall and memory.   So he wrote a handwritten note within 15 days saying: I have been on and off; and he was obviously -- he is extremely heavily medicated.   If I could reserve the balance of my time.

Russell, this Court reaffirmed its longstanding treatment of statutory time limits for the taking of appeals as jurisdictional.   Section 7266(a) imposes a 120-day time limit on the taking of an appeal to the Veterans' Court, and under the rule reaffirmed in Bowles, that time limit is a limit on the court's jurisdiction, and the judgment of the court of appeals should be therefore be affirmed.

Here, although we are dealing with an Article I court, there are characteristics of what you might call internal agency review.

But what Bowles emphasized was not just the historical treatment of the particular time limit in section 2107, but the historical treatment of statutory time limits for appeals in general, which is why the Court cited not only 2107 cases but-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It didn't mention -- Bowles didn't mention anything like an appeal from an agency where the district court is -- is sitting, essentially, as an appellate court.

And the fact that there are exceptions written into it lends some support to the notion that we, as a court, should not read other exceptions into it that weren't mentioned.   That's something the Court seemed to emphasize.   And here, when I looked at this statute, I noticed there are no exceptions written into it.

The first is that there are many statutes, including the Hobbs Act, the immigration statute, that have no provision for exceptions.

The extension provision that was specifically at issue in section 2107 in Bowles hadn't -- wasn't even enacted until 1991.

Now you have listed -- and Bowles, I thought, left that open.   But -- but if it does leave it open, and I'm looking to those factors.   You have mentioned one: That this is a long period of time, 120 days.   You are right about that.   Is there anything else? "}, {"speaker": "Eric D.

"}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Let me just point out on the Hobbs Act, the actual statute says the jurisdiction is invoked by filing a timely petition for review.   So there is an express jurisdictional hook.   And I think Justice Scalia points out an interesting fact on -- I think it's safe to say in 1988, Congress wasn't sitting down thinking: This is deadline jurisdictional; we're subject to equitable tolling.   What we had is a period where veterans were not given judicial review.   We had World War II and the Vietnam conflict and the Korean conflict, which made it just untenable that veterans were not being treated on par with other claimants seeking disability benefits.   And the sponsor of the bill points out, since Social Security disability benefits get judicial review, how can we not treat our nation's veterans the same?   Now-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

I may be wrong.   It sounds like we have a different understanding.   But if I can get back on to what is really before this Court, is that when there's no indication, all we have is the three words -- \"notice of appeal\" -- when we know that those three words are non-jurisdictional in the criminal context.   There is nothing jurisdictional about the words \"notice of appeal\".   It accurately describes that an appeal is going on.   It doesn't say anything about whether the deadline is jurisdiction.   And the question is: Was Congress thinking about the type of people who appeal district courts to courts of appeals?   Yes, they were, but they made separate provisions for that.   Or were they thinking about the Hobbs Act, which deals with licensing of the nuclear power plants and orders by the FCC, and has an express statement in the text that it is jurisdictional?   I doubt that -- I think it is safe to say that Congress was not thinking about any of those contexts.   They were trying to give veterans their day in court.   And this decision would say no matter what the circumstances were, they are deprived.   Now there was some discussion on the 120-day deadline.   I think another thing that is very safe to say is that time is not of the essence in the veterans system.   It never has been.   120 days is a blink of an eye.   It is true that Social Security are given 60 days and other appellants are given 30. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.
