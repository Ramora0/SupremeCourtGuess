[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 21-1333, Gonzalez versus Google. Mr. Schnapper. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 230(c)(1) distinguishes between claims that seek to hold an internet company liable for content created by someone else and claims based on the company's own conduct.   That distinction is drawn in each of the three sections of the statute. First, Section 230(c)(1) is limited to claims that would treat the defendant as a publisher of third-party content.   The statute uses \"publish\" in the common law sense.   The Fourth Circuit decision in Henderson correctly interprets this statute in that manner and concludes that it involves two elements: the claim must be based on the action of the defendant in disseminating third-party content, and the harm must arise from the content itself. Second, Section 231 -- 230(c)(1) is limited to publication of information provided by another content provider, which is often referred to as third-party content.   The statutory defense doesn't apply insofar as a claim is based on words written by the defendant or other content created by the defendant.   In some circumstances, the manner in which third-party content is organized or presented could convey other information from the defendant itself, as the government notes. Third, Section 230(c)(1) only applies insofar as a defendant was acting as an internet computer service.   Most entities that are internet computer services do other things as well.   This Court technically is an interactive computer service because of its website.   It does other things, as it is doing today. Conduct that falls outside that line of activity is outside the scope of this statute. A number of the briefs in this case urge the Court to adopt a general rule that things that might be referred to as a recommendation are inherently protected by the statute, a decision which would require the courts to then fashion some judicial definition of \"recommendation.\" We think the Court should decline that invitation and should instead focus on interpreting the specific language of the statute. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mr. Snapper -- Schnapper, just so we're clear about what we're -- the -- your claim is, are you saying that YouTube's application of its algorithms is particular to -- in this case, that they're using a different algorithm that -- to the one that, say, they're using for cooking videos, or are they using the same algorithm across the board? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " It's the same algorithm across -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " -- the board. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " -- so what is -- if -- if it's the same algorithm, I think you have to give us a clearer example of it -- what your point is exactly.   The same algorithm to present cooking videos to people who are interested in cooking and ISIS videos to people who are interested in ISIS, racing videos to people who are interested in racing. Then I think you're going to have to explain more clearly, if it's neutral in that way, how your claim is set apart from that. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Surely.   The -- if I might turn to the practice of displaying thumbnails, which is a major part of what's at issue here, the problem -- and the issue is not the manner in which YouTube displays videos.   It actually displays, as you doubtless know from having looked at, these little pictures, which are referred to as thumbnails.   They are intended to encourage the viewer to click on them and -- and go see a video. It's the use of algorithms to generate these -- these thumbnails that's at issue, and the thumbnails, in turn, involve a -- involve content created by the defendant. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " But the -- it's basing -- the thumbnails, from what I understand, is based upon what the algorithm suggests the user is interested in.   So, if you're interested in cooking, you don't want thumbnails on light jazz.   You -- so the -- it's -- it's -- it's neutral in that sense.   You're interested in cooking.   Say you get interested in rice -- in pilaf from Uzbekistan.   You don't want pilaf from some other place, say, Louisiana. The -- so the -- I don't see how that is any different from what is happening in this case.   And what I'm trying to get you to focus on is if -- if the -- are we talking about the neutral application of an algorithm that works generically for pilaf and -- and it also works in a similar way for ISIS videos? Or is there something different? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " No, I think that's correct, but -- but our -- our view is that the fact that a -- a -- an algorithm is neutral doesn't alter the application of the statute. The statute requires that one work through each of the elements of the defense and see if it applies. The -- the lower courts, in a couple of cases, have said that -- really disregarding the requirements of the -- of the defense, that as long as an algorithm is neutral, that puts the -- the conduct outside the -- within the -- the protection of the statute. But that's not what the statute says. The statute says you must be acting -- you must be -- the claim must treat you as a publisher. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but, I mean, the -- the -- the difference is that the Google, You -- YouTube, they're still not responsible for the content of the videos or -- or text that is transmitted. Your focus is on the actual selection and recommendations.   They're responsible that a particular item is there but not for what the item -- item says.   And I -- I don't -- I -- I think part -- it may be significant if the algorithm is the same across -- as Justice Thomas was suggesting, across the different subject matters, because then they don't have a focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities or -- or pilaf or something, and then I think it might be harder for you to say that there's selection involved for which they could be held responsible. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " The -- the -- the statute, I think, doesn't draw the distinction that way.   The -- the claim here is about the encouragement of -- of -- of users to go look at particular content.   And that's the JASTA claim that we'll hear about tomorrow. And the underlying substantive claim is encouraging people to go look at ISIS videos would be aiding and abetting ISIS.   More on that tomorrow. But, if that's an actionable claim, then the conduct here would fit within it, the -- because certain individuals would be shown these thumbnails, which would encourage them to go look at those videos. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So I think you're right, Mr. Schnapper, that the statute doesn't make that distinction.   This was a pre-algorithm statute.   And, you know, everybody is trying their best to figure out how this statute applies, this statute which was a pre-algorithm statute applies in a post-algorithm world. But I think what was lying underneath Justice Thomas's question was a suggestion that algorithms are endemic to the internet, that every time anybody looks at anything on the internet, there is an algorithm involved, whether it's a Google search engine or whether it's this YouTube site or -- or -- or a Twitter account or countless other things, that everything involves ways of organizing and prioritizing material. And -- and that would essentially mean that, you know, 230 -- I guess what I'm asking is, does -- does -- does your position send us down the road such that 230 really can't mean anything at all? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " I -- I -- I don't think so, Your Honor.   The question -- as you say, algorithms are ubiquitous, but the question is what does the defendant do with the algorithm.   If it uses the algorithm to direct -- to encourage people to look at ISIS videos, that's within the scope of JASTA. It's not different than if back in 1996 a lot of clerks somewhere at Prodigy did this manually and just had a bunch of file cards and they figured out who was interested in what. The statute would have meant the same thing there that it does now.   It's automated, it's at a larger scale, but it doesn't change the nature of what they're doing with the algorithm.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can I -- I'm sorry, finish. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " The -- the -- the brief -- I think the brief for Respondent points to a number of uses of algorithms, for example, to pick the cheapest fare or things like that. That's just outside the scope of the statute. The algorithm is being used there to generate additional content. So the question is what you do with the algorithm.   The fact that you did it with an algorithm doesn't give -- yield a different result than if you had a lot of hard-working people in a -- in an office somewhere doing the same thing. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " We seem -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I guess I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Oh. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- I -- I take the point -- if -- if I could just -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, no, go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You know, I take the point that there are a lot of algorithms that are not going to produce pro-ISIS content and that won't create a problem under this statute, but maybe they'll produce defamatory content or maybe they'll produce content that violates some other law. And your -- your argument can't be limited to this one statute.   It has to extend to any number of harms that can be done by -- by speech and -- and so by the organization of speech in ways that basically every provider uses. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Well, it -- if I might turn to the example of what you said, referred to, an algorithm that produces defamation.   I may be paraphrasing that wrong. If the -- if the -- let's say the algorithm generates a recommendation -- a -- a -- a face -- a thumbnail that on its face is -- is benign, it just says interesting information about Frank, you go there, and it's defamatory. The defendant's not responsible -- or excuse me -- the defense applies to the video itself that you saw.   The question would be whether the thumbnail was actionable.   And under -- in most circumstances, thumbnails aren't going to be actionable. In addition, the -- the thumbnails typically include a snippet from a -- a video or a text or whatever.   If the snippet itself were defamatory, again, the defense -- the statutory defense would apply because what was being displayed was third-party content.   And so the statute still applies there. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I suppose that Google could -- YouTube could display these thumbnails purely at random.   But, if it does anything than displaying them purely at random, isn't it organizing and presenting information to people who access YouTube? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Yes, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " -- that doesn't put it within the scope of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, does that -- does that constitute publishing? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Yes.   So they would -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It does? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " -- they would be publishing -- they would be publishing the -- the thumbnail. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " But -- but, if the -- if the thumbnail isn't itself -- if -- if the -- if the -- the way they're using it is -- is -- is encouraging people to engage -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, that's a different question, though, isn't it? I -- I don't know where you're drawing the line. That's the problem. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Oh, I see, I see, I see. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " That's the problem that I see. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Oh. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Unless you're -- you're saying that the publishing -- the publication requirement is satisfied under all circumstances, unless the thumbnails are presented purely at random. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " It's publication even if it's at random, but the -- but the -- the -- the injury in the hypothetical we're talking about about ISIS doesn't follow from the content of the thumbnail.   The thumbnail would typically be fairly benign.   The harm comes -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, but in every instance, in those instances where the thumbnail is benign, that's not a concern for purposes of this case, but in all those instances where some plaintiff might have some cause of action based on the content of the video that has been posted -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " There would have to be a cause of action, as we assert there is in JASTA, for encouraging people to go look at the video.   That's a fairly uncommon form of cause of action. The cause of action -- insofar as the plaintiff asserts a cause of action based on the video itself, that's within the -- that's -- that you've been sent to, that's within the scope of the defense. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And is that because of the way in which you're interpreting the statute? I mean, can we -- can we back up a little bit and try to at least help me get my mind around your argument about how we should read the text of the statute? I took your brief to be arguing and that of those who support you that the statute really is about one kind of publishing conduct -- conduct, and that is the failure to block or screen offensive content. Am I right about that? In other words, what you say is covered by Section 230 and that Google could, like -- could rightly claim immunity for is a claim that there was something defective about their ability to screen or block content, that the content is up there and you should be liable for it? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " I -- I think we -- we've -- I -- I think that's not our claim. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " I think we are trying to distinguish between liability for what's in the content that's on their websites that you could access and actions they take to encourage you to go look at it. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Yes, yes, that's your claim.   I'm just trying to -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " It's the encouragement that we're -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- understand how you read the statute.   Your -- the statute, you say, covers only scenarios in which the claim that's being made is that there's offensive content on the website, that you didn't take it down, that, you know, you failed to screen it out, but if you're making a claim that you're encouraging people to look at this content, that's something different, that's the claim you're making, and it's not covered by the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " That's our -- that's the distinction -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " -- we're trying to draw.   I mean, it -- the distinction is illustrated by the e-mail in the Dyroff case, which -- which is the precedent that -- that got us here in the Ninth Circuit. In that case, there was a, I think, 26-word -- 26-word e-mail from the website to an individual which read something like there's something new that's been posted to the question where can I buy heroin in Jacksonville, Florida. To access it, use this URL or use this URL. It's our contention that that is outside the protection of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But is that really different -- I guess I'm trying -- so they would argue, I think, that even assuming that the statute only covered the kinds of things that you say it covers, you know, defective blocking and screening, meaning there's still offensive stuff on your website and you should be liable for it, I think they would say that to the extent your claim is talking about their way -- their algorithm that presents the information, it's really the same thing, that you're -- that it reduces -- it's tantamount to saying we haven't, you know, blocked this information, it's still on the website, because algorithms are the way in which the information is presented. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " So, to try and make clear, as I may not have done that well, the distinction we're drawing the -- our claim is not that they did an inadequate job of block -- of -- of keeping things off their -- the -- their computers that you can access from -- from outside or from failure to -- to block it. It's that that's the -- that's the heartland of the statute.   What we're saying is that insofar as they were encouraging people to go look at things, that's what's outside the protection of the statute, not that the stuff was there. If they stopped recommending things tomorrow and -- and all sorts of horrible stuff was on their website, as far as we read the statute, they're fine.   It's the recommendation practice that we think is actionable. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can I break down your complaint a moment? There -- the vast majority of it is paragraphs after paragraphs after paragraph that says they're liable because they failed to take ISIS off their website.   I think, as I'm listening to you today, you seem to have abandoned that and -- and are saying they don't have to take it off their website. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " That -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Am I correct about that? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " That -- that's exactly right.   That -- that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Right.   So that can't be -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " -- is the way we've framed the question presented. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So that can't be -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " We did not advance that claim. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you're abandoning that claim, so that can't be aiding and abetting.   So I think I'm listening to you, and the only aiding and abetting that you're arguing is the recommendation, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You're not arguing that they're -- some of these providers create chat rooms or put people together, users together.   You're not claiming that that's part of what you're arguing about? The social networking, I want to call it. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Well, that's not at issue in this case.

It's not about -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " This is about content.   And I just want to focus your complaint so I understand it very clearly. You're saying the -- the YouTube or the \"Next up\" feature of the algorithm that says you viewed this and so you might like this, it's \"you might like this\" that's the aiding and abetting? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Uh -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What -- what part of what they're doing? Because, I mean, you -- you -- whoever the user is types in something, they get an ISIS video, you say that's okay -- they can't be liable for you, the -- me, the viewer, looking at the ISIS vehicle.   But the internet providers can be liable for what? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Okay.   So they're -- they're -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " For showing me the next video that's similar to that? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " All right.   They're -- they're -- it would be helpful perhaps if I distinguish between two kinds of practices that -- that go on at YouTube.   The complaint doesn't describe them in detail, but we're fairly familiar with them.   So what we can talk -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm glad, but I'm going to be to look at complaint because it can only survive if the complaint is adequate.   So you're going to have to tell me where in the complaint you're saying this if I'm going to think about holding them liable.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " I'm about three questions -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- you're going to have to separate out the two things then. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Okay.   I'm about three questions behind.   Let me --- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " -- let me try and do my best here.   So what we've been talking about up until now is the use of -- of thumbnails to encourage people to look at content -- people who haven't clicked on any video yet.   And our contention is the use of thumbnails is -- is the same thing under the statute as sending someone an e-mail and saying: You might like to look at this new video. Now the \"up next\" feature is a different problem, and the problem there is -- is that when you click on one video and you pick that one, YouTube will automatically keep sending you more videos which you haven't asked for. That, in our view, runs afoul of a different element of the statutory defense, which is that they be acting as an interactive computer service.   And when they go beyond delivering to you what you've asked for, to start sending things you haven't asked for, our contention is that they're no longer acting as an interactive computer service.   The difference -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So, even if I accept that you're right that sending you unrequested things that are similar to what you've viewed, whether it's a thumbnail or an e-mail, how does that become aiding and abetting? I'm going back to Justice Thomas's question, okay, which is, if they aren't purposely creating their algorithm in some way to feature ISIS videos, if they're -- I mean, I can really see that an internet provider who was in cahoots with ISIS provided them with an algorithm that would take anybody in the world and find them for them and -- and do recruiting of people by showing them other videos that will lead them to ISIS, that's an intentional act, and I could see 230 not going that far. I guess the question is, how do you get yourself from a neutral algorithm to an aiding and abetting -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- an intent, knowledge? There has to be some intent to aid and abet.   You have to have knowledge that you're doing this. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how do you get there? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " So the -- the -- if -- if the algorithm recommends an ISIS video or it automatically plays it, that -- as we'll see tomorrow, that with -- by -- in itself isn't going to satisfy aiding and abetting. Aiding and abetting requires knowledge that it's happening.   So the elements of the aiding and abetting claim, which we'll be talking about tomorrow, address the question you're asking. If -- if this was teed up, if they didn't know it was happening, and the other elements of an aiding-and-abetting claim were present, they would not be liable for aiding and abetting. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Just one short question.   Your -- your friend on the other side presented an analogy that she thought would be helpful, which -- a book seller that has a table with sports books on it, and somebody comes in and says, I'm looking for the book about, you know, Roger Maris, and the bookseller says, well, it's over there on the table with the other sports books. Isn't that analogous to what's happening here? You type in ISIS -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " I'm not sure -- I'm not sure where that -- that gets us.   I mean, it wouldn't be any different than sending an -- an e-mail saying that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, we'll figure out where we get -- it gets us in a minute.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, what lies ahead is the idea that you could look at that and say it's not pitching something in particular to the person who's made the request. It is recognizing that it's a request about a particular subject matter and it's there on the table, and they might want to look at that or they may not want to look at it. But it's really just a 21st-century version of what has taken place for a long time in many contexts, which, when you ask a question, people are putting together a group of things, not necessarily precisely answering your question.   I mean, if somebody said -- "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Yes -- no, I -- I -- all right.   I think -- I think I know where we're going here.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sure.   That's an easy case.   They give you a bunch of cat videos.   You don't have any complaint about something like that. In this case, if they put in something, say, show me ISIS videos, they would get a bunch of ISIS videos, and you don't have any objection to that given the way the search was phrased. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " It -- I have to answer that with precision.   If I say, play for me an ISIS video, and they just directly play the video, then what they've done falls within the language of the statute.   It's requested, it's purely third-party content, and I would try and be hold -- trying to be holding them liable for displaying that content. But what actually has happened -- and this is maybe analogous to what goes on to some extent at Twitter, where they might actually literally just show you the thing.   But what's happening at YouTube is they're not doing that. I type in ISIS video, and there are going to be a catalogue of thumbnails which they created.   It's as if I went into the bookstore and said, I'm interested in sports books, and they said, we've got this catalogue which we wrote of sports books, sports books we have here, and handed that to me.   They created that content. And -- and -- and if you publish content you've created, you're not within the four walls of the statute.   So a lot depends on exactly -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But you would not -- you would not -- under your theory, they would not be liable for the content of the books, they'd be liable for the catalogue? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " By -- by -- by providing the catalogue. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   Thank you. Justice Thomas, anything further? "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " What if the -- YouTube, instead of automatically providing this list, which is hard -- it's hard for me because I don't see this as -- I see these as suggestions and not really recommendations because they don't really comment on them. But what if you had to click on something like \"For more like this, click here\"? Would that also be, as far as you're concerned, aiding and abetting or outside this statute? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " It's -- so you -- you've played one video and they say click here to see another one? "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " No, click here if you want suggestions for more like this. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " No, suggestions are -- depending how it happens.   Let's say they say send me more -- show me more thumbnails.   It's outside the statute. And if I might come back to an earlier part of what's embedded in your question, we aren't asking the Court to adopt a rule that's about recommendations versus suggestions.

So you're on Facebook and certain items are prioritized on your news feed, or certain tweets are prioritized on your Twitter feed, all right, and that there's some algorithm that's doing that and that's amplifying certain messages rather than other messages on your feed.   That's the second. And then the third is just a regular search engine.   You know, you put in a search and something comes back, and in some ways, you know, that's one giant recommendation system. Here's the first item you should look at. Here's the second item you should look at. So are all three of those not protected, or what happens to my second and third?

The -- the -- there's a lot of discussion on search engines, but there's not a specific provision in the statute that says search engines are protected.

It's publishing third-party content. The third question is, could they be liable for the way they prioritize things? And the answer is I think so.   It's going to depend how -- what happened.

And, you know, every other industry has to internalize the costs of its conduct. Why is it that the tech industry gets a pass? A little bit unclear. On the other hand, I mean, we're a court.

I think that the task for this Court is to apply the statute the way it was written. And if I might return to a point that Justice Alito made, much of what goes on now didn't exist in 1996.   The statute was written to address one or two very specific problems about defamation cases, and it drew lines around certain kind of things and it protected those. It did not and could not have written -- been written in such a way to protect everything else that might come along that was highly desirable.   Congress didn't adopt a regulatory scheme.   They protected a few things. It will inevitably happen, it has happened, that companies have devised practices which are maybe highly laudable, but they don't fit within the four walls of the statute. That will continue to happen no matter what happens -- what you do.   And the answer is, when -- when someone devises some new -- some new practice that may be highly desirable but doesn't fit within the four walls of the statute, the -- the industry has to go back to Congress and say: We need you to broaden the statute because you wrote this to protect chat rooms in 1996, and we want to do something that doesn't fit within the statutes.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Schnapper, I just want to make sure I understand, as you say, the statutory language and how this case fits with it, and if we could start with Section 230(f)(4), which defines the term \"access software provider.\" It includes, among other things, \"picking, choosing, analyzing, or digesting content.\" And we might in another world in our First Amendment jurisprudence think of picking and choosing, analyzing or digesting content as content providing, but the statute seems to suggest that's not what it is, it's something different in this context, in this statutory context, and it's protected. Do you agree with that? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " No.   Let -- and I -- if I might explain why? "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Briefly.

But let's just take that as given, okay, that I think that what, say, Google does in picking, choosing, analyzing, or even digesting content just makes it an access software provider.   Let's take that as given, and so that that would normally be protected activity. But (f)(3) carves out a scenario where you become a content provider, and that's something different in my mind to picking, choosing, analyzing, or digesting content, okay? Let's just take those two premises as given. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " All right? You got to do something beyond picking, choosing, or analyzing or digesting content, which is what search engines typically do, even as I understand it.   You've got to do something beyond that. As I take your argument, you think that the Ninth Circuit's \"neutral tools\" rule is wrong because, in a post-algorithm world, artificial intelligence can generate some forms of content, even according to neutral rules. I mean, artificial intelligence generates poetry, it generates polemics today. That -- that would be content that goes beyond picking, choosing, analyzing, or digesting content.   And that is not protected. Let's -- let's assume that's right, okay? Then I guess the question becomes, what do we do about YouTube's recommendations? And -- and as I see it, we have a few options.   We could say that YouTube does generate its own content when it makes a recommendation, says \"up next.\" We could say no, that's more like picking and choosing. Or we could say the Ninth Circuit's \"neutral tools\" test was mistaken because, in some circumstances, even neutral tools, like algorithms, can generate through artificial intelligence forms of content and that the Ninth Circuit wasn't sensitive to that possibility and remand the case for it to consider it -- that question.

It can create a catalogue of ISIS videos, which would be analogous to a compilation under Section 101 of the Copyright Act. A compilation is a distinct entity, it's copyrightable, even if the elements of it were not.   So, yes, absolutely, the software could create something like that.

And the statute does refer to organization, and the definition, as he was saying, of interactive computer service means one that filters, screens, picks, chooses, organizes content. And your position, I think, would mean that the very thing that makes the website an interactive computer service also mean that it loses the protection of 230.   And just as a textual and structural matter, we don't usually read a statute to, in essence, defeat itself. So what's your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " My response is that the text doesn't apply here.   Let me explain why.   The -- the element in -- the -- the list in -- in (f)(4) refers to only one of the three kinds of interactive computer services in (f)(2). In (f)(2) -- and this is -- this is on page 267 of the petition appendix. (f)(2) says \"an interactive computer service means\" -- and there -- it gives you three candidates, you've got one of them -- \"an information service, a system, or an access software provider.\" Now YouTube is one of the first two. It doesn't -- it's not a software provider.   The definition in (f)(4) only delineates who is an access software provider.   It doesn't apply to who's an information system or service.   And that was Congress's choice. Congress didn't say you're an interactive -- you're a service, an information service or a system if you do those things.   It said you're only -- those things only bring you within the four walls of interactive computer service if you're -- if you're a software provider.   And -- and that made sense in the context of what was happening in 1996. In 1996, if you wanted to go online, you would typically sign up with CompuServe or Prodigy and they would literally give you diskettes.   They would sell -- they would be selling you software. And -- and this provision in (f)(4) is about that activity.   That's not what's happening here. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, just -- just to go back to 1996 and maybe pick up on Justice Kagan's questions earlier, it seems that you continually want to focus on the precise issue that was going on in 1996, but then Congress drafted a broad text, and that text has been unanimously read by courts of appeals over the years to provide protection in this sort of situation and that you now want to challenge that consensus. But the amici on the other side say: Well, to do that, to pull back now from the interpretation that's been in place would create a lot of economic dislocation, would really crash the digital economy with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you, and those are serious concerns and concerns that Congress, if it were to take a look at this and try to fashion something along the lines of what you're saying, could account for.

"}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " So I guess -- I guess I'm thoroughly confused, but let me -- let me try to -- let me try to understand what your argument is.   I think that the confusion that I'm feeling is arising from the possibility that we're talking about two different concepts and conflating them in a way. I thought that Section 230 and the questions that we were asking in this case today was about whether there was immunity and whether Google could claim the defense of immunity and that that's actually different than the question of whether whatever it does gives rise to liability.   That is, is there liability for aiding and abetting? That's tomorrow's question. And to the extent that you keep coming back to this notion of creating content or whatnot, I feel like we're conflating the two in a way that I'd like to just see if I can clear up from my perspective. Your brief says that the immunity question, Section 230(c)(1)'s text is most naturally read to prohibit courts from holding a website liable for failing to block or remove third-party content. And I read the arguments in your brief and I read what you said about Stratton Oakmont and the sort of background, and so I thought your argument was that the -- that you can only claim immunity, Google, if the claim that's being made against you is about your failing to block or remove third-party content. To the extent we are making a claim about recommendations or doing anything else, any of the, you know, hypotheticals that people have brought up, that's outside of the scope of the statute because, really, the statute is narrowly tailored in a way to protect internet platforms from claims about failing to block or remove, right? I mean, that's what I thought was happening. All right.   So, if that's true, then all the hypotheticals and the questions about are you aiding and abetting if Google, you know, has a priority list or if there's recommendations, maybe, but that's not in the statute because we're just talking about immunity.   We're just talking about whether or not you've made a claim for failing to block or remove in this case today related to Section 230. Am I doing too much of a separation here in -- in terms of how I'm conceiving of it? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Well, let me articulate what -- what the contention is that we are advancing, and I think it's not quite the way you described it.   The contention we're advancing is that a variety of things that we're loosely characterizing as recommendations fall outside of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Why? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Because, in some of them, the defendant's not being treated as the publisher; because, in some of them, third-party content's being -- content is being created by the defendant; because, in some of them, the defendant's not acting as an interactive computer service. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " I see.   So I -- I thought -- I thought you were -- the answer to why was because the statute is limited, because the statute only focuses on certain kind of publisher conduct, and to the extent that -- that they're doing anything else, recommending or whatever, that's not going to be covered by this statute. But you're sort of saying, well, let's look at what they're actually doing and it may fit in or it may not.   You're not sort of hewing very closely to the understanding of the original scope of the statute in terms of what it is trying to immunize these platforms against. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " I -- I -- I think we're trying to do that in somewhat more of a particularized way, that is, to -- to identify -- to work our way through each of the three specific elements of the statute, each tied to particular language, to -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But I've got to tell you I don't see three elements in this.   I mean, part of me -- part of this is all the confusion, I think, that has developed over time about the meaning of the statement in the statute, right? I don't see three elements.   I see literally a sentence, and the sentence in my view reads as though they're trying to actually direct courts to not impose publisher liability, strict publisher liability, against the backdrop of Stat -- of Stratton Oakmont. So there's like some -- somehow we've gotten to a world in which we've teased out three elements and we're trying to fit it all into that, when I thought there was sort of a very simple, sort of straightforward way to read the statute that you articulate in your brief, which is this is really -- this statute, (c)(1), is really just Congress trying to not disincentivize these platforms for blocking and screening offensive conduct. And so what they said is let's look at (c)(1).   Let's have (c)(2).   Let's have a system in which a system -- a platform is not going to be punished, strict liability for just having offensive conduct on their website, and, if they try -- if they try to screen out, we're not -- we're going to say you won't be responsible for that either.   That's (c)(2). But it really doesn't speak to whether you do a recommendation or whether you have an algorithm that does priorities or any of these other things.   That's how I thought that -- that at least I was looking at the statute in light of its purposes and history and -- and -- and Stratton Oakmont and all of that, in which case I think you would win, unless your recommendations argument really is just the same thing as saying they are hosting ISIS videos on their website. "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Well, I -- I think -- I think we do have to be drawing that distinction. But, with regard to your question about the three elements, the -- the text does take you there.   It says, if you track the briefs probably of either side, the -- part of -- we're arguing about the meaning of \"treat as a publisher\" because that's the first couple of words of the statute. Then we're arguing about did they create the content because \"publisher\" has to be of -- has to be of information provided by another content provider.   So we have to parse out the meaning of that. And then it refers to the defendant as an interactive computer service, and we have to parse out the meaning of, well, what does that mean? So we -- we are forced to -- this -- this -- the language of the statute has those three components, and it -- it -- although the overall purpose is I think as you described it, the language is more complex and particularized. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by addressing the Roger Maris hypothetical because I -- I think it illustrates our position and the limits on our position. Imagine in -- in a particular state there was an unusually protective law that said no booksellers shall be held liable on any theory for the content of any book that it sells, and then the scenario that the Chief Justice described occurred, the person was asked where is the Roger Maris book and said it's over on that table with the other sports book -- books. Now, if the bookseller was sued for making that statement, our position would be there's no way textually that the immunity statute would apply.   This is a statement about the book, not the contents of the book. Now the statement \"the book is over there\" is so obviously innocuous that it might seem like pedantry to quibble about should the dismissal of the suit be based on immunity or for failure to state a claim.   But a court, in thinking about the possibility of harder cases down the road, should distinguish carefully between liability for the content itself, liability for statements about the content. And the other one other thing I would say is, if the consequence of saying \"it's over there\" was that the bookseller lost its immunity for the content of the book, that would be a big deal.   But our position on 230(c)(1) is nothing like that. Our position is that the internet service provider can be sued for its own organizational choices, but the fact that it makes organizational choices doesn't deprive it of the protection it receives for liability based on the third-party content. I -- I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I'm still confused, but, what if the bookseller said, \"it's over there on the table with the other trustworthy books\"? "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I mean, I think at that point you would be asking could it conceivably be an actionable tort to describe the book as trustworthy. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, we're putting a lot of weight on organization.   But doesn't it really depend on how we're organizing it and on what the basis of the organization -- for example, we could say this set -- you could organize it on the basis of what's more trustworthy than -- than something else. "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I think that might matter with respect to whether there was substantive liability under the -- the underlying cause of action.   It -- it shouldn't matter for purposes, either of the hypothetical immunity I -- statute I described, which focuses exclusively on the contents of the books, or for 230(c)(1). Now Mr. Schnapper said in a colloquy earlier that he thought the allegations in his complaint are basically the same as those in the Twitter complaint.   And the government is arguing in Twitter that those allegations are not sufficient to state a claim under the Anti-Terrorism Act. So our -- our interest in 230(c)(1) is not in allowing this particular suit to go forward.   It is in preserving the distinction between immunity -- protection for the underlying content and protection for the platform's own choices. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I -- I just think it's going to be difficult.   How would you respond to Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical about the artificial intelligence creating content organizational decisions? "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I mean, I think the organizational decisions could still be subjected to a suit.   Whether you think of them as recommendations or simply as the platform -- the -- the operation of the platform, it's still the platform's own choice. And if you ask how did a particular video wind up in the queue of a particular individual, it -- it could be some -- some sort of artificial intelligence that was making that choice, but it would have to do with the -- YouTube's administration of its own platform. It wouldn't be a choice made by any third-party who had posted it because third parties who post on YouTube don't direct their videos to particular recipients. And -- and I -- I do want to emphasize this -- this theory, this rationale applies even in the most mundane circumstances.   For instance, if you do a Google search on the name for a famous person and you misspell the name slightly, you still get lots of content about that person.   Google knows that it's smarter than we are and it knows that -- more about what we want than the literal terms of our search might suggest. I went to the Court's website and used the docket search function and typed in Google and left off the -- the final E and I got a message that said no items find -- found.   In order to call up the docket for this case, you have to spell Google exactly right. Now the choice between those two modes of operating the platform, it's extraordinarily unlikely, almost inconceivable that it could ever give rise to legal liability, but those are choices made by the platforms themselves.   They are not choices made by any third party.   They just don't implicate 230(c)(1). And the choice -- the -- any conceivable lawsuit about the decision to use one mode of operation rather than the -- another, presumably, would be dismissed on the merits.   But -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I -- I think the problem, Mr. Stewart, with minimizing what your position is is that in trying to separate the content from the choices that are being made, whether it's by YouTube or anyone else, you can't present this content without making choices.   So, in every case in which there is content, there's also a choice about presentation and prioritization. And the whole point of suits like this is that those choices about presentation and prioritization amplify certain message -- messages and thus create more harm. Now I appreciate what you're saying is like, well, that doesn't mean that you're going to have liability in every case, but -- but -- but still, I mean, you are creating a world of lawsuits.   Really anytime you have content, you also have these presentational and prioritization choices that can be subject to suit. "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " Let -- let me say a couple of things about that.   The first thing I would say is you could make substantially the same argument about employment decisions.   That is, in order for YouTube to operate, it has to hire employees. But Ms. Blatt acknowledges in the -- the brief that employment decisions wouldn't be shielded by 230(c)(1) if there was an allegation of unlawful discrimination, for instance. So the fact that the platform has to make some sorts of organizational choices doesn't mean it's immune from suit in the rare instance where it might make a choice that violates some other provision of law. The second thing is the -- the concern we have in mind are things like imagine a hypothetical job matching service like Indeed, where job applicants can post their qualifications and potential employers can post their own listings and the website will match them up. And suppose it came to light that the job -- the job search mechanism was routing the high-paying, more professional jobs disproportionately to the white applicants and the lower-paying jobs to the black applicants even when the qualifications were the same. At -- at a general level, you could describe that as choices about which content would go to which users.   But, when we saw that kind of stark impropriety in the criteria that the platform was -- was using, I think we would say there has to be -- assuming it violates applicable law, 230(c)(1) really shouldn't be protecting that.   That's not -- the complaint we have here is not to the content itself or the presence of the -- the third-party job postings on the platform.   The complaint is about the use of illicit criteria to decide which users will get which content. And -- and our point is, in the more innocuous cases or in the borderline cases where the criteria seem a little bit shaky, but it's not clear whether they violate any applicable law, that that choice ought to be made based on the law that the plaintiff invokes as the cause of action.   And the Court ought to be determining, does the use of those criteria violate that law? And it -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I was just going to say your -- the problem with your analogies is that they involve -- I don't know how many employment decisions are made in the country every day, but I know that whatever it is, hundreds of millions, billions of responses to inquiries on the internet are made every day. And, as Justice Kagan suggested, under your view, every one of those would be a possibility of a lawsuit if they thought there was something that the algorithm referred that was defamatory, that, you know, whatever it is, exposed them to harmful information.   And so that may be the analogy doesn't fit the particular -- particular context. "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I mean, I -- I think it is true that many platforms today are -- are making an enormous number of these choices.   And if Congress thinks that circumstances have changed in such a way that amendments to the statute are warranted because things that didn't exist or that weren't on people's minds in 1996 have taken on greater prominence, that would be a choice for Congress to make. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but choice for Congress to make -- I mean, the -- the amici suggest that if we wait for Congress to make that choice, the internet will -- will be sunk.

Stewart", "text": " I -- I think the main thing I would say is most of the amici that are making that projection are making it based on a misunderstanding of our position; namely, they are misunding our -- misunderstanding our position to be that once YouTube recommends a video or once YouTube sends a video to a particular user without the user requesting it, that YouTube is liable for any impropriety in the content of the video itself. And that's not our position.   Our position is that YouTube's own conduct falls outside of 230(c)(1).   It's unlikely in very many instances to give rise to actual liability.

And so, if Google had posted a message that said we recommend that you watch this video, now the recommendation would be its own content.

And our understanding is that at least under the common law the answer to that would be no, that simply saying you should read this book that turns out to be defamatory would not be a basis for defamation liability. I think the same would basically be true of intentional infliction of emotional distress.   That is, unless you could show that the platform was acting with the intent to cause emotional distress by circulating the video, there would be no liability.   And the fact that the third-party poster may have met the elements of that offense wouldn't carry the day. With respect to antitrust, if you had a claim that a particular search engine had configured its results in such a way as to boost its own products or to diminish the search results for products of the competitor and if that were found to be a viable claim under the antitrust laws, there would be no reason to insulate the provider from liability for that.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Stewart, I -- I just again kind of want to make sure I understand your argument, and so I'm going to ask you a question similar to what I asked Mr. Schnapper, which is the Ninth Circuit held that any information a company provides using \"neutral tools\" is protected under 230.   That's at 34a of the -- of the -- of the petition. And your argument is that this \"neutral tools\" test isn't in the statute.   What is in the statute is a distinction on the one hand between interactive computer service and access software providers and on the other hand content providers. And when we look at that, the access software provider is protected for picking, choosing, analyzing, or even digesting content. So 230 protects an access software provider, an interactive computer service provider, who does any of those things, whether using a neutral tool or not.   They -- they can order, they can pick, they can choose, they can analyze, they can digest however they wish and they're protected, even those -- even though those editorial functions we might well think of as some form of content in our First Amendment jurisprudence, but, here, they're shielded by 230. And then your argument, I think, goes that none of that means that they're protected for content generated beyond those functions. And it doesn't matter whether that content is generated by neutral rules or not.   That content is actionable whether the -- and one could think of content generated by neutral rules, for example, by artificial intelligence. And another problem also is that it begs the question what a neutral rule is.   Is an algorithm always neutral? Don't many of them seek to profit-maximize or promote their own products? Some might even prefer one point of view over another. And because the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong test, this \"neutral tools\" test, rather than the content test, we should remand the case for reconsideration under the appropriate standard.   Is that a fair summary of your position? And, if not, what am I missing? "}, {"speaker": "Malcolm L. Stewart", "text": " I -- I think the thing -- the aspect of that we would disagree with is we don't think that the definition of \"access software provider\" means that an entity is immune from liability for performing all of those functions. The statute makes clear that even if you perform those sorting, arranging, et cetera, functions, you still fall within the definition of \"interactive computer service,\" and you are still entitled to the protection of (c)(1). But the protection of (c)(1) is protection from liability for the third-party content.   And so, if you perform those sorting functions in a way that was otherwise unlawful, you could be on the hook for that. And that -- that takes me back to the -- the hypothetical about the job placement service that discriminates based on race.   The -- the allegation of the job placement -- of that job placement service is not that it created any of its own content.   The allegation would be that with respect to third-party content provided by the firms that were looking for employees, it had used an impermissibly legal -- a legally impermissible criterion to decide which content would be sent to which users.   And that wouldn't be protected by (c)(1) because imposing liability wouldn't hold the platform -- wouldn't treat the platform as the publisher or speaker of the third-party content.

I get that. I guess what I'm trying to understand is whether you say and plaintiff says, Petitioner in this case says, well, what they're really doing in the situation in which they display it under a banner that says \"up next\" is more than just providing that content and failing to block it.   They are promoting it in some way. And I -- I'm really drilling down on whether or not there is actually a distinction in a world of the internet where, as Ms. Blatt and others have said, in order to be a platform, what you're doing is you have an algorithm, and in the universe of things that exist, you are presenting it to people so that they can read it.

Just back on the 230 piece of it, in terms of Congress's intent with respect to the scope of immunity, I'm -- I -- I guess I just want to understand why Google or YouTube, when they have a box that brings up all of the ISIS videos and tees them up and, if you don't do anything, they just keep playing, why that's actually different than the newspaper publisher who gets the offensive -- content and decides to put it on page 1 versus page 20.   It seemed like Congress in its -- in -- in 230 was saying, if you -- if -- if under the common law a newspaper publisher would be liable for having put it on page 1 or whatever and given it to people, we don't want that to be the case for these internet service companies.

And the situation we're concerned with is what if a platform is able through its algorithms to identify users who are likely to be especially receptive to ISIS's message, and what if it systematically attempts to radicalize them by sending more and more and more and more extreme ISIS videos, is that the sort of behavior that implicates either the text or the purposes of Section 230(c)(1), and we would say that it doesn't.

(c)(1) forbids treating websites as \"the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another.\" Publication means communicating information.   So, when websites communicate third-party information and the plaintiff's harm flows from that information, (c)(1) bars the claim. The other side agrees Section 230 bars any claim that YouTube aided and abetted ISIS by broadcasting ISIS videos.   So they instead focus on YouTube's organization of videos based on what's known about viewers, what they call targeted recommendations.   They say that feature can be separated out because it implicitly conveys what viewers should watch or that they might like the content. But accepting that theory would let plaintiffs always plead around (c)(1).   All publishing requires organization and inherently conveys that same implicit message. Plaintiffs should not be able to circumvent (c)(1) by pointing to features inherent in all publishing. (c)(1) reflects Congress's choice to shield websites for publishing other people's speech, even if they intentionally publish other people's harmful speech. Congress made that choice to stop lawsuits from stifling the internet in its infancy.   The result has been revolutionary. Innovators opened up new frontiers for the world to share infinite information, and websites necessarily pick, choose, and organize what third-party information users see first. Helping users find the proverbial needle in the haystack is an -- existential necessity on the internet.   Search engines thus tailor what users see based on what's known about users.   So does Amazon, Tripadvisor, Wikipedia, Yelp!, Zillow, and countless video, music, news, job-finding, social media, and dating websites.

Now, when you have that situation, the claim is fairly treating the website for publishing its own speech, and you can separate that out from the harm that's just coming from the information provided by another. And the danger which your hypotheticals has raised with express speech is where on that continuum any express speech may go because, unlike Google and YouTube, which are the two world's largest sites, we don't have a lot of endorsements and that kind of stuff, but other websites and other users use a myriad of topic headings and emojis that have different meanings that I'm not prepared and you would have to know what they mean, like kinds of checkmarks and, I don't know, high fives and all kinds of things. But the basic features of topic headings, \"up next,\" \"trending now,\" those kinds of things we would say are core, inherent -- the -- they're no different than expressing what is implicit in any publishing, which is we hope you read this. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, it seems to me that the -- the language of the statute doesn't go that far.   It says that -- their -- their claim is limited, as I understand it, to the recommendations themselves.   In other words, this -- this is the list of things that you might like. But that information, the recommendation, is not provided -- under the words of the statute, it's not provided by another information content provider.   It's provided by YouTube or -- or Google. And so, although whatever the liability issue may be, there's some issue tomorrow and there are a lot of others, the presence of an immunity under 230(c), it seems to me, is just not directly applicable. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, that's incorrect because of the word \"recommendation.\" There is no word called \"recommendation\" on YouTube's website.

That's not the -- the -- the provider of the underlying information. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S.

If you say I think my readers would all be interested in this or I think the readers in ZIP code 2005 would be interested in it or if you walk up to someone and say I'm going to defame someone because I thought you might be interested in it, it's still publishing. And the other side gives you no line and no way to say in some way that would be workable or give websites or users any clarity of how you would organize the world's information.   Just think about search.   There are 3.5 billion searches per day.   All of those are displays of other people's information.   And you could call all of them a recommendation that are tailored to the user because all search engines take user information into account. They take the location, the language, and what have you. And I can give the example of football.   Football -- the same two users will enter the word \"football\" and get radically different results based on the user's past search history and their location and their language because most of the world thinks of football as soccer, not the way we do. And so, if you go down this road of did you target it, then you have to say how much? Was the topic hitting too much? Was it okay to have a violence channel? Was it okay to have a sex channel? Was it okay to have, you know, what have you, some other channel about skinny models that you could say, well, that just kept repeating the -- the channel and that made me crazy.

And he posits that that wouldn't happen very often. But we don't know. My question is, isn't there something different to what Congress was trying to do with 230? Isn't it true that that statute had a more narrow scope of immunity than is -- than courts have, you know, ultimately interpreted it to have and that what YouTube is arguing here today and that it really was just about making sure that your platform and other platforms weren't disincentivized to block and screen and remove offensive conduct -- content?

And let me give you an example.   A website could put something alphabetical in terms of reviews, and every Young, Williams, and Zimmerman, i.e., X, Y, Z, could say, well, that was negligent because you should have rated it somewhere else.

There's only two arguments on the table for what you could think that (c)(1) does. And that is it simply says, you know, no internet -- interactive computer service shall be treated as a publisher.   And you could think, well, there are two -- two ways of looking at that.   One is that you need an external law that has publication as an element, and then, second, which I think that your question may be going to, is it only directed to eliminating forms of strict liability across all causes of action? And so both -- both of those ways are highly problematic and also inaccurate given what was happening in -- in 1996. In terms of just looking at this as is this just talking about defamation, it plainly can't be because the statute would be a dead letter upon inception because any defamation cause of action can -- can be replead as negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress. So we think the word \"treat,\" which means to regard, applies whenever the claim is treating the -- or imposing liability because -- by virtue of publishing.   In other words -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But what -- what do you do with the -- what do you do with the title and the content and the context, right?

So what you have is (c)(2) is -- and -- and they work together, and if you -- every time you weaken (c)(1), you make (c)(2) useless and defeats the whole point of this statute at least in terms of cleaning up the internet. (c)(2) is just a safe harbor and directs what happens when you take stuff down. It says nothing about what happens to the content that's left up.   And so the more any website removes material, it perversely is showing that it has knowledge or should have known or could have known about the content that was left up. And so you have one of two things happen -- that -- that would happen and would have happened then and would happen now.   The first is websites just won't take down content. And that just defeats the whole point, and you basically have the internet of filth, violence, hate speech, and everything else that's not attractive. And the second thing which I think a lot of the briefs are worried about in terms of free speech is you have websites taking everything down and leaving up -- you know, basically, you take down anything that anyone might object to, and then you basically have -- and I'm speaking figuratively and not literally -- but you have the Truman Show versus a horror show. You have only anodyne, you know, cartoon-like stuff that's very happy talk, and otherwise you just have garbage on the internet.

Now, in my example, you're not being held responsible for another person's defamatory remark.   You're being held responsible for your choice in broadcasting that defamatory remark to millions and millions of people who wouldn't have seen it otherwise through this pro-defamatory algorithm.

And if you decide to run reruns of the most sexually explicit and violently explicit, you could say that's a bad thing, and it may be, but on your choice -- but -- but it would be protected under 230. In terms of what was happening in 1996, I strongly disagree with the notion that algorithms weren't present based on targeted recommendations.   The Center for Democracy and Technology has this wonderful history lesson of what was happening in '92 through '94 on how targeted recommendations developed. And you had something called news groups, which were for anyone using the internet, that was sort of what people did. They signed up for a news group, and those news groups adopted the technology that is the technology that is alleged in this case. They looked at what the user was looking at.   Say the user was looking at science news.   And they thought, oh, that also user is looking at some other kind of news, maybe on psychology or something.   And so they would make recommendations based on your user history and that of others. Amazon two months into 1997 introduced its famous feature, if you buy X, you might like Y based on that technology.   So this technology was present starting in '92. And '92 through '96, the internet was definitely different, but it was kind of a mess. You still had to organize it.   So there were search engines.   There was all kinds of features that were organizing content because even then it was massive.   It's just now on, like, an exponentially greater scale.

Yet, if we take Justice Kagan's example, you're saying the protection extends to internet platforms that are promoting offensive material.   So it suggests to me that it is exactly the opposite of what Congress was trying to do in the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S.

You -- you don't -- you don't disagree that Congress was focused on offensive material, that that's sort of the basis of the whole statutory scheme. So, if we take as a given that we're talking about offensive material, it looks to me from the text of the statute that Congress is trying to immunize those platforms that are taking it down, that are doing things to try to clean up the internet. And in the hypothetical that we just -- that was just presented, we have a platform that is not only not taking it down in the way that the statute is focused on, it is creating a separate algorithm that pushes to the front so that more people would see it than otherwise the offensive material. So how is that even conceptually consistent with what it looks as though this statute is about? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, so just a couple things.   And, again, I -- we're on this defamatory material.   The website itself does something defamatory that's not -- it's independent of the third-party content.   It's not protected. But that same hypothetical could be said if it was on the front -- the -- the home page as opposed to you had to do a search engine first.   And I don't see anything in the statute that protects it. In terms of what I think your deeper section is -- deeper concern is, the reading of the statute, I don't think it's coterminous with (c)(2), which is dealing with the type of offensive material, which, by the way, doesn't mention defamation. In terms of (c), we talked about how they work together.   We talked about how it could be easily overrode if it had just publication.   The one thing we didn't talk about was the structure in Section (e). (e) is a laundry list -- a laundry list of a variety of exceptions under federal law to which (c)(1) does not apply as well as (c)(2).   And those exceptions make very little sense if (c)(1) is read the way you're reading it.   It would almost never apply to (c)(2). And let's just take federal criminal laws.   It would make very little sense because those laws -- almost none of them have strict liability as an element, and vanishingly few would have publication or speaking as an element.   It's in there for no other reason other than that (c)(1) would otherwise apply to the -- the -- the -- the information provided by another. And in terms of just the pure text, when you keep saying its failure to take down, I'm hearing you say what Congress wrote was treatment as a publisher.   That means dissemination.   That means publishing. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Except Congress didn't say that. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " You cannot be held liable for publishing. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " If you look at the statute, it says, \"Protection for 'Good Samaritan' blocking and screening.\" If you take into account Stratton Oakmont, if -- those things I thought were like a given, what -- what the people who were crafting this statute were worried about was filth on the internet and the extent to which, because of that court case and -- and perhaps others, the platforms were not being incentivized to take it down, because if they were trying to take it down like Prodigy, they were going to be slammed because they were going to be treated as a publisher. And so the statute is like we want you to take these things down, and so here's what we're going to do.   We're going to say that just because they're on your -- your -- your website, it doesn't mean you're going to be held automatically liable for it.   And that's (c)(1). And to the extent you're in (c)(2), you're trying to take it down, but you don't get them all, we're not going to hold you liable for it. That seems to me to be a very narrow scope of immunity that doesn't cover whether or not you're making recommendations or promoting or doing anything else. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, I mean, that -- that is -- what I understand the government and the Petitioner to be saying is that disseminating -- even 24/7 disseminating of ISIS videos is protected.   The only thing that's not protected is whether you can tease out something about the organization and call it a recommendation when there is no express speech recommending it. It's just the placement of where in the order in which content appears. And that same complaint could be made about search engines.   So I think, under your view, search engines would not be covered because they are taking user information, targeting recommendations in the sense of they're saying we think you would be interested in the first content as opposed to the content on, you know, 1,000,692 sections.   I mean, they have millions and millions of hits for any search result. And if you think those are recommendations and the other side gives you no basis for distinguishing between search engines, then the statute is just very different than I think the one that Congress was talking about, because, again, if you're going to look at findings and history and policy, this is about diversity of viewpoints, jump-starting an industry, having information flourishing on the internet, and free speech.

The law is indifferent to what the content is.   It's just very unhappy about any kind of status-based distinction.

Blatt", "text": " -- here's our test, and it's the test the Fourth Circuit recently took in Henderson, and it's the test the Ninth Circuit took. Let me give you an example that I think may help with the ad revenue sharing.   So this was an allegation that YouTube was giving money to ISIS.   Now this was in connection with third-party videos, third-party information. But the court said, no, that is not within Section 230 because that's independent of the information, that's giving money to ISIS.   That kind of, whatever you think about its validity under the statute, you're not treating them as a publisher; you're treating them as a financer. And it's just -- and that's the test of the Fourth Circuit too.   The Fourth Circuit is looking -- in that case, it was about -- you know, all kinds of things were happening with third-party information, and they were trying to tease out is it the credit report, did they contribute to the credit report, was it based on the website's failure to -- to notify the employee. And what the Fourth Circuit said is the exact same thing we said, and it's the exact same thing the plaintiff has said on four pages of its brief or four times in its brief, that you're looking for the harm.   What is the harm caused? And this case is the perfect example. The plaintiffs suffered a terrible fate, and their argument is it's because people were radicalized by ISIS. And if you start with the concession that the dissemination of those ISIS videos are -- and a claim based on that is barred, the question is, is what additional comes from the way it was organized? The government just says, I don't know, let some state figure it out.   That's not very helpful to internets that have to work on a national level and are posting and sorting and organizing billions upon billions upon billions of piece of -- pieces of information. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So, just -- just to clarify, this is my last point, you're happy with the Henderson test, the Fourth Circuit test? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Yes.   I would say Henderson is like 96 percent correct.   I got a little lost when they were going down the common law on publication, but the result was great.   I just thought they got a little weird on the publication. But, yeah, no, their test is correct, and it's also the Ninth Circuit's test on the ISIS revenue.   It's the exact same test we quote in our brief, and it's the exact same test Petitioner did. And what that harm test is doing, if I could just explain it because it sounds kind of shorthand, but if you take the -- which I'm not sure Justice Jackson agrees with, but if you take the underlying notion that this bars treatment as a publisher, and you're saying, well, can they get around it by the way they're pleading it, you're just looking to the harm, so you're saying you can't really say that's negligence or intentional infliction because the harm is coming from the publishing of the defamatory content. And so what I think all these cases where the courts are correctly saying 230 does not apply to the claim is they're isolating the harm and saying that's independent of the third-party information.   It's either based on the website's own speech or it's website's own conduct that's independent of the harm flowing from the third-party information. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   So if -- but then, if I do a search for today's news in YouTube -- in fact, I did that yesterday -- and all the top hits were very well-known news sources.   Those are not recommendations.   That's not YouTube's speech? The fact that YouTube put those at the top, so those are the ones I'm most likely to look at, that's not YouTube's speech? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Right.   But, I mean, all search engines work the same way.   If you type in whatever you type in, there is a algorithm that's deciding what content to display.   It has to be displayed somehow. And what I think is going on on YouTube or it's certainly going on on Google Search is they're not going to -- they're looking at what did other users look, how popular was it, that kind of thing.   You know, is it -- is that news source, you know, from Russia? Probably not going to get on the top list. So, yeah, they're having to make choices because there could be over a billion hits from yours, and there are a -- a billion hours of videos watched each day on YouTube and 500 hours uploaded every minute, so it's a lot of content on YouTube.   So some of it's based on channels, and some of it's based on searches. But they have to organize it somehow. But that is what's going on, I think, on your top searches, is they're -- in most search engines too, and you can look at the Microsoft brief, they're basing it on what -- time spent on those news sites, how many users are looking at them, how relevant it is, if it's -- if you're -- if you're typing in the Turkey earthquake, they might be elevating some stuff that's featuring that because it's, you know, seems more relevant. If there's a recent election, they might feature that.   So all these kinds of decisions are being made by websites every day. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Would -- would the -- would Google collapse and the internet be destroyed if YouTube and, therefore, Google were potentially liable for posting and refusing to take down videos that it knows are defamatory and false?

I mean, you do have that situation in Europe, but there -- there's not class actions. There's not plaintiffs' lawyers.   There's just not the tort system.   So what you would have is a deluge of people saying, you know, my -- that restaurant review was -- you know, you say my restaurant review, I didn't like it. I think Yelp! does an amazing job on this, about how much they got hit and had to spend, you know, almost crushing litigation because they were being accused of being, you know, biased on reviewers.   And everyone -- no matter what -- they couldn't win for losing or lose for winning, whatever the phrase is, because whoever they -- whoever got reviewed, somebody was upset.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Ms. Blatt, it -- it -- it -- I -- I kind of want to return to some of the questions I asked earlier.   It seems to me inherent in (c)(1) is a distinction between those who are simply interactive computer services and those who are information content providers. And so, when we flip over to (f), the distinction I -- I -- I glean from that is that if you're picking, choosing, analyzing, or digesting content, which is the bulk of what you -- how you describe Google's activities in -- in the search engine context, are -- are protected and that content must be something more than that, providing content must be something more than that. Is -- is that right in your view? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " I -- I thought you were absolutely correct.   And I think some of the amicus briefs do this.   In terms of if you're looking at what is information being created or developed, there is that distinction.   It can't be that you -- by sorting, you created or partially developed the information. So I think you had it exactly right. I got a little upset when you talked about a remand that somehow the Ninth Circuit got it wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, let's -- let's go there next then, because it -- it seems to me that even under that understanding of the statute, there is some residual content for which an interactive computer service can be liable. You'd -- you'd agree with that, that that's possible? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Not on this complaint because -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " No, no, no, of course, not on this complaint, but in the abstract, it -- it's possible? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Absolutely correct. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   And then, when -- when it comes to what the Ninth Circuit did, it applied this \"neutral tools\" test, and I guess my problem with that is that language isn't anywhere in the statute, number one. Number two, you can use algorithms as well as persons to generate content, so just because it's an algorithm doesn't mean it doesn't -- can't generate content, it seems to me. And third, that I'm not even sure any algorithm really is neutral.   I'm not even sure what that test means because most algorithms are designed these days to maximize profits. There are other examples -- Justice Kagan offered some, the Solicitor General offered some -- where an algorithm might be -- contain a -- a point of view and even a discriminatory one. So I -- I guess I'm not sure I understand why the Ninth Circuit's test was the appropriate one and why a remand wouldn't be appropriate to have it apply the -- the test that we just discussed. "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Because it's not -- I don't think that was the Ninth Circuit's test. It was one sentence that -- maybe I think it mentioned it twice -- that's basically, you know, almost making fun of the complaint. The complaint doesn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Oh, oh, okay.   Okay. So we're just disagreeing over how we read the Ninth Circuit's opinion, but if I read it that way, then would a remand be appropriate? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " Well, I'm -- I'm going to say no because I don't understand how -- how somehow that they have a bad complaint means the Ninth Circuit's worse off when the Ninth Circuit said over and over and over you haven't -- this is just the way you're organizing it. And the complaint never alleges there was something independently wrongful about the content.   It never says these were colloquial recommendations.   It just says because you previously liked this content. And one other thing.   The complaint never even alleges that the -- YouTube ever recommended to any -- in terms of even displaying an ISIS video, to anybody who wasn't looking for it.   I don't even know how you could get ISIS on your YouTube system unless you were searching for it.   And the one -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I -- I certainly understand your -- your -- your complaints about the complaint.

Blatt", "text": " I'm defending it with respect to Justice Kagan's question, absolutely, because she's concerned about biased algorithms, and she doesn't have to worry about that in this case because they have neutral algorithms they don't allege.

The owner -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " So I'm sorry, inherent to publishing, it's covered? "}, {"speaker": "Lisa S. Blatt", "text": " The home page.

So, if I -- if I disagree with you and I -- and I'm -- about the meaning of the statute, all right, focusing in on the meaning of the statute, you say, if you're making editorial judgments about how to organize things, then you're a publisher and you're covered. If I think that the statute really only provides immunity if the claim is that the platform has this ISIS video there and it can be accessed and it hasn't taken it down, do you have an argument that the recommendations that they're talking about is -- is tantamount to the same thing?

Blatt", "text": " Yes, because the only basis for saying recommendations are not covered is -- that I saw is the government saying is it conveys a distinct implicit message that you might be interested.

Those could just be a product liability claim or a negligence claim.   You negligently went alphabetical or you negligently featured whatever you featured that made my, you know, kid addicted to whatever it was.   And that -- those kind of claims happen because they're publishing.   And the whole point of getting this statute was to protect against publishing.   So whatever is publishing, inherent to publishing, yeah, has to be covered. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Schnapper? "}, {"speaker": "Eric Schnapper", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I might start with my colleague's reference to things inherent in publishing, I would just offer a cautionary note, and review of the transcript will support this.   That -- that has been given an extraordinarily expansive account here. So topic headings were characterized as inherent in -- in publishing.   You know, a topic heading could be how Bob steals things all the time.   That's not -- shouldn't be protected. She mentioned \"trending now\" as inherent in publishing, but that's like \"featured today.\" You could run -- you could have a site that didn't use the words \"trending now.\" Autoplay certainly isn't inherent in publication. And -- and she mentioned home pages, and you have to have a home page, and that's fair, but you don't have to have on the home page selected things that you're drawing people's attention to.   The home page that I have on my desktop for Google is a box and those charming little cartoons, and there isn't anything featured there.   One could have a -- a website home page for YouTube that wasn't promoting particular things.   That's just how they've chosen to do it. With regard to neutral tools, and this goes back to a point a number of you made about race, a neutral algorithm can end up creating very non-neutral rules.   It's not hard to imagine that an algorithm might conclude that most people who -- who went to Spelman and Morehouse now live in Prince George's County and, therefore, in showing you videos, people who ask for videos about places to live near Washington, if they're black, they'll be shown Prince George's County; if they'll be -- if they're white, they'll be shown Montgomery County. The algorithms can create those kinds of rules.   Whether -- characterizing that as neutral loses its force once the defendant knows it's happening.   You know, to some extent, algorithms and computer functions can run amok, but you can't call it neutral once the defendant knows that its algorithm is doing that.   And this runs a little bit into the issue that we'll be talking about tomorrow. Two short points and then one closing item.   With regard to Rule -- Section (f)(4), I said this before, I just want to reiterate it, Section (f)(4) does not apply to systems or to information services.   It only applies to software providers.   The language of the statute is very specific. And with the question about the possible implications of the decision in -- in Taamneh, it -- it is fair -- it is normal practice in the district court when there's a motion to dismiss to permit the plaintiff to amend to deal with the relevant standard, and that's exactly what we ought to be afforded an opportunity to do.
