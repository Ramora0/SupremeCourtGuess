[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 21-1326, United States ex rel. Schutte versus SuperValu Inc., and the consolidated case. Mr. Singh. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The False Claims Act establishes three independent ways to prove scienter for a defendant who presented legally false claims. First, if the defendant correctly interpreted the law and then chose to break it, that's actual knowledge.   Second, if the defendant didn't bother to honestly assess what the law required before improperly presenting claims or presented claims as if they were definitely true despite knowing that they might well be false, that's either deliberate ignorance or recklessness.   And, third, a defendant may have adopted an interpretation of the requirement that was so unreasonable as to be objectively reckless. On the other hand, if the defendant attempted to discern and follow the correct interpretation of the law and was transparent with the government about how it resolved ambiguities, there's no scienter.   This rule is not easy for plaintiffs, but it is a fair rule that follows the plain meaning of the text, tracks more than a century of the common law of fraud, and achieves the fundamental purpose of scienter, which is to accurately separate culpable mind sets from innocent ones. Respondents' rule, by contrast, holds that contemporaneous scienter can be negated retroactively if the defendant's conduct falls within a wrong but reasonable interpretation of the law.   It treats the defendant's subjective beliefs about the lawfulness of its conduct as irrelevant. This would permit some of the worst offenders to escape liability.   Indeed, Respondents would -- would allow a defendant who presented false claims to admit that he wanted to break the law and yet simultaneously deny that he acted with scienter. That outcome alone shows how extreme their rule is and ought to discredit it.   But the problems don't stop there.   Across the board, Respondents would replace existing incentives for companies to determine and then follow the law with an incentive to plunder every ambiguity for all it's worth.   That flies in the face of the statute's text, the common law, and common sense. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mr. Singh, the -- if there was no guidance as to what \"usual and customary\" meant, do you think that an employee and -- sorry -- the Respondent here would also -- could also be accused of having made false statements? If there was no guidance whatsoever as to what it meant. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, I -- I do think that the -- the words themselves have a meaning, \"usual and customary\" -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So what -- what would you say it is? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " So I -- I think, at a very minimum, if you had to find the sort of irreducible core of it, it's the price you're normally charging to cash customers.   That's how it's always been understood since it was enacted.   And -- to a majority of the cash customers. And so, if you're charging a price only to a small fraction of cash customers, I think calling it your usual and customary price has always understood -- been understood to be a false statement. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " What if you could show that in Nebraska, which is a part of this, that you had -- it was read one way, but in Iowa, it was read another way, and there was still no guidance, or disparate ways in different places? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Could you -- would you still say that you could find that -- they -- these statements were false or representations were false? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   I think that falsity is generally understood in an objective sense.   That is, a statement either is true or is false.   Now it may be the case that \"usual and customary\" is interpreted different ways in different states by their Medicaid programs, and so the same practice may be okay in one state and not okay in another.   That's a possibility. But what I would say is, even when you have -- let -- let's just take a slightly different example.   Let's say that there are different courts that interpret a statute a couple different ways.   You know, one is right and one is wrong.   There's a true one and a false one. The next question, which is really what's before the Court, is about can -- can it be knowingly false.   And, there, we think the answer turns on subjective beliefs. But, in response to the frontline question, can it be false, I don't actually think that there is a dispute about that question.   That is, there is a right answer, and if you don't get it right, that's false. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I'm just -- normally, you have a baseline from which you deviate, and I'm trying to establish whether or not there is a baseline from which you can objectively deviate before you -- or whether that's necessary before you can say it's false. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " So, if -- if everything were totally indeterminate, if there was no -- no statute, no regulation, literally nothing -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " No, I'm looking at these words, \"usual and customary.\" "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah.   So, in this case, the question of whether the Respondents' claims were false is really not before the Court.   In the Schutte case, the district court granted summary judgment to us on that question, and the Respondents didn't contest that on appeal.   In the Safeway case, the court didn't reach it because it got to scienter first. But I think, as the case comes to this Court, as you think about how to understand the issues here, the way I would do it is I would start from the premise that they presented false claims.   They took money they weren't supposed to take.   And now the question is, did they do so with the sort of mental state that would allow the imposition of the False Claims Act's remedies? And I think that that's been the crux of the debate between the parties. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, that's the only reason I'm asking that, is shouldn't -- you said they -- they took money they shouldn't take. So, in order to determine that, we have to know what they should have taken and they have to know what they should have taken. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes.   So the definition adopted by the lower courts was it's the -- so the definition in the regulations is the cash price charged to the general public.   And so -- so, also, I guess I should back up.   You know, I took your question to be premised on a hypothetical world in which there was no guidance. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " In this world, there was guidance.   There -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, isn't the argument, though, about how much guidance you need in order for there to be -- a deviation to be false? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " No, Your Honor, I don't think that is the argument at all.   In this case, I -- I take it as a given that the claims were false.   They have not argued otherwise either on appeal below or here.   And so the question is just, what did they know? Now that does get to the second part of the question that you just elucidated.   Well, what did they have to know? How could they have known? And what we would say is that under the common law of fraud, which is incorporated into the False Claims Act, it's enough if you correctly believe your claims are false.   That is, based on the guidance that was available, Respondents -- if Respondents formed a view that said, okay, you know, when we start charging these prices to a majority of the cash customers, we've got to report them -- and we have evidence in the record that that's exactly what they thought -- then we've got to also pass those discounts on to the government.   But you know what, let's not do that.   Let's instead charge the government more because we would take a huge hit to our margins if we did the other thing. We think that that would count as actual knowledge under the False Claims Act or, at a minimum, when you know there's a real substantial risk that that's how it's going to be interpreted, which, again, they would have known because pharmacy benefit managers, Medicaid states, and others were reaching out to them and saying, hey, you have to report all of your discounts, how are you reacting to Walmart's program? Walmart had started charging $4 for all of the generics, and it passed that discount on to the government.   And so, naturally, these intermediaries -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What -- "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " -- for the government, Medicaid agencies wanted to know.   Oh, I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What -- what if there's a situation where \"U&C charges,\" there are three different ways you can interpret that. Let's say A, B, and C, and A is clearly in the safe zone, B is a little more aggressive, and C is, you know, pushing the envelope, but, you know, we -- we still think it's a reasonable interpretation, and we're going to go with C because our job is to make money, and so we're going to go with C because we think that's objectively reasonable interpretation. It turns out later on that's ruled wrong.   You're using the word \"false.\" So that's false.   Why liability in a situation like that, or is there liability in a situation like that? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " There well might be.   And, here, I just want to clear -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " There well might be? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Liability, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Even -- even though it's objectively reasonable, that A, B, and C are all objectively reasonable? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " So let me work through why I think the answer is yes. In the hypothetical, I'm assuming that the company has said we think A is the best interpretation, but B and C are also possible, and we're going to go with C. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yeah, which happens every day in the executive branch too. We'll get to that. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Sure.   And so the government -- the -- the company has chosen in this instance to abide by an interpretation of the law that it thinks is wrong or probably wrong, right? "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " We think that that is culpable -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- no, no.   I mean, it's not the -- to be wrong or probably wrong means that it's outside the scope of a reasonable interpretation of the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " So there I think is where perhaps the disagreement is.   You know, as -- as you posited before, it's false.   And so maybe I'll use that word.   They've chosen to abide by an interpretation -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " That's a loaded term here, but go ahead with it. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " But I think that that's how this statute is meant to work.   That is to say, I agree with you, Your Honor, very strongly that left to their own devices, companies believe our job is to make money, and they will do the thing that -- that will make the most money.   And it would be naive to expect them to follow a different interpretation if there weren't some incentive to do so. I think Congress understood that as well when it enacted the False Claims Act.   The False Claims Act is designed not to allow a company to identify every possible reasonable interpretation or every interpretation it thinks it could get a judge somewhere to pick and then choose the one that's most profitable. The False Claims Act is designed to create that economic incentive to actually follow the best interpretation. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I -- I guess I'm -- I'm -- I'm a little bit surprised by your answer to Justice Kavanaugh, because I thought that this case comes to us on the understanding that they thought that this interpretation was wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Not, like, possibly permissible but possibly not the best one, that they thought that this interpretation was wrong, they knew it was wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, that is what we've argued in this case, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, not -- not you've argued. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " -- I don't think liability is limited to that circumstance. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I thought that that was a given, and the question was what's the effect of that. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That that's a given and then the question is, well -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And they -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- does -- does that count under the statute if you can find somebody else later to say, well, they knew it was wrong, but, in fact, it was objectively reasonable even though it was wrong.   So that's what the case comes to us as -- that's the question, right? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, that is the question.   And so I guess maybe I'll split the world again into two sets of facts. One is where contemporaneously the sentences were not doing the right thing, but it's possible, you know, you hire the best lawyers later after you get sued and they come up with a rationalization and say, oh, but maybe it could have been reasonable.   You know, it's -- it's arguably defensible. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I thought that that's the question before us -- "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- at time A -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And I'm asking about a hypothetical.   That's what I was trying to do. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah.   But, Your Honor, I would say even in the situation in which the timing is different from this case -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Right.   We're at the time -- so let's -- I'm asking -- this is a hypothetical. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.   At the time, you have three different interpretations possible, and one's clearly safe, one's a little more aggressive, and the third's really aggressive, but you still think it's reasonable, and you go with that third one, and it's later -- they don't agree later on, so it's \"false.\" And you said you're still liable even in that circumstance, and I find that -- now Justice Kagan correctly says that's not this case.   I just want the answer to the hypothetical so I can figure out how to think about all this. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   So I think there are circumstances in which that could be culpable.   And so, here's -- you know, the first one is, as I said, if the view inside the company is this is probably wrong, we're going to do it anyway, that is -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, I doubt -- I mean, probably wrong, so you're loading the hypothetical, I think, for how attorneys -- this is aggressive.   This is pushing the envelope, but we think we can defend it.   It could be a stretch.   It's not out of the bounds. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah.   So one other factor that we -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " We've got to -- we're trying to make money. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " -- think would be relevant, just to populate the hypothetical with -- with a few more facts that might be relevant, you know, the -- the statute also includes, for example, deliberate ignorance, and that places an onus on companies when it's available to seek clarification. And so, in many of these programs, there are avenues to seek clarification to say, hey, we have these three interpretations, we think this one is good, tell us. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel, I -- I would have thought the answer to the question, if -- if you think there's a material risk, but you think it's reasonable, that that's a recklessness question and that, therefore, the objective inquiry that -- that your friend on the other side's arguing for might be appropriate in those circumstances but that your case just simply isn't that case. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, that's true, but I guess I would say I -- I do agree that in the objective sense of recklessness, a reasonable interpretation can be.   Right, so I'll -- I'll -- I'll go with that. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I -- I think that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " That said, there, in the common law of fraud, recklessness is used also in a slightly different way, which is you are subjectively aware of a substantial risk and you choose to ignore it. And so I think that does cover this potential hypothetical as well, which is to say, when you have the three interpretations, you know that one's a -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " You might be reckless. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " -- a little out there, you may be reckless to simply pursue it, especially if -- and I -- I want to point this out.   As I said in the introduction, it's important to ask whether companies are being transparent with the government in what they do.   So, if you were to say to the government -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But I -- counsel, just -- just -- just so I -- I -- I -- I understand where -- where we're at, we're not asked to address those circumstances.   We're asked to posit that there is indeed a falsity, and we're asked whether, in addition to recklessness, one might proceed under the statute according to its plain terms to show actual knowledge or intent to deceive. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And all we're asked about is the mental state here. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, absolutely right. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And -- okay. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " And so -- and we think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I've never heard anybody -- "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " -- that mental state can be -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- I've never heard an attorney fighting people trying to help him. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " And I'm not trying to.   I promise. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " This is what -- well, you -- you're -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " It happens all the time here. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, it certainly happens right now. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Can I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Oh, go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- the -- the bottom-line question, I think, that we're asking is, however we define \"reckless,\" we're not being asked to define \"reckless\" today.   We're being asked whether the intent of someone to make a false statement is actionable even if later they come up with a different -- an objectively reasonable argument, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So the only -- "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " But your -- your question -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- the only issue then might -- may be different in terms of recklessness if someone is proceeding on an understanding they had at the time and it turns out to be wrong.   That's where recklessness would come in. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And how we define that we can leave for later, right? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes.   So objective recklessness is not really before the Court. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " So we can leave the hypothetical of the person who at the time thought about these different options as opposed to the person who only later came up with the legal interpretation? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " So I think that you -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Because your case, as Justice Kagan pointed out, is only the latter. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Well, I -- I suspect Respondents are going to disagree about that characterization of the case and say that they have factual -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, I agree with Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " -- points to present. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " That's how the case came to us. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And we should decide the case as it came to us and leave for another day, I think, the question of if at the time you considered these various options. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Sure.   So, in -- in that -- in that mode of deciding the case, the question before you is the straightforward one of was the Seventh Circuit correct to say subjective understanding and beliefs are irrelevant and we think always irrelevant if the interpretation can be shown reasonable after the fact. We think that's the easy case.   No, they're not, because actual knowledge is in the statute because it's a false statute. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, that's this case. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes.   Yeah, and so you could decide -- you could reverse, going no more broadly than that. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why are you arguing all these hard cases? (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Because I -- I asked him.   I asked him. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I know, but your -- your case is the easy case, isn't it? You need to tell us why it's different from the hard cases. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Well, sure.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " He wants to win the hard case here too, but you don't need to. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Well, that's -- that's correct, Your Honor.   And so I -- you're right that I don't need to win the hard case.   I was trying to address the hypothetical on its own terms.   But, of course, we believe this case is quite different. At the time, the Respondents had ample evidence in terms of guidance from the government, guidance from their own attorneys, industry consensus that if you are offering 80 percent of your sales for a certain drug at a particular price, 80 percent of the cash sales at a particular price, that also had to be the usual and customary. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, that sounds like you're arguing that it wasn't a reasonable interpretation.   I find it easier to apply the scienter requirements to facts than to law, so let me give you this hypothetical. The law could mean X or it could mean Y, and a -- an entity that ends up being the defendant in a False Claims Act case says, we think there's a 49 percent chance the courts will say it's X, which is good for us, and a 51 percent chance that they will say that it's Y, which is bad for us, and, therefore, we think it really means X -- I mean, I'm sorry, really means Y, the unfavorable interpretation.   But there's a 49 percent chance that the court will adopt the more favorable interpretation. What would -- would there be liability there -- "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- because they turn out to be accurate.   The court says, you know, this is a tough question.   We think it's 51 percent for Y, 49 percent for X.   Therefore, we're going with X -- with Y. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah.   So, again, this is one of these hypothetical hard cases that isn't this case, but I'll -- again, I'll try to -- to tilt it -- it and see how -- how it goes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I mean, we do take these cases -- "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- to decide legal questions and not just to decide the particular case. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes.   And so, again, I believe that if the company affirmatively believes we are probably wrong in our interpretation and yet presents a claim with no qualifications, no transparency about the ambiguity, but does so in a way that the government couldn't tell from the face of the claim that they're following interpretation X and not Y, right, then, yeah, that's either actual knowledge or recklessness, we think, and it could be deliberate ignorance if there are avenues for clarification that they did not seek. We think that's certainly a possible frame for liability.   And let me just offer you -- and I know I'm over my time, so I can also come back to it. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Briefly. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Sure.   I actually think it's not harder to do this for law than for facts.   You could posit a situation in which the facts are really, really hard to determine. Let's say it was based on whether a majority of your sales happened.   And there was a computer virus.   You lost a lot of your data.   But an employee says internally, you know, I'm pretty sure that more than half of our sales were at this price.   I can't be a hundred percent sure. I'm pretty sure.   And then you submit the claim as if that weren't true. Again, I think that the scienter standard works the same way for facts and law. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, when you allege fraudulent or filing of false claims, is that something you have to allege with particularity? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Okay. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Does this difference matter mostly for purposes of summary judgment, how many cases are going to be disposed of at summary judgment? Does it matter so much if the case gets beyond summary judgment? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " So I think it certainly could.   In this case, if you rule in our favor, this case will go forward to a trial.   And, to be clear, I don't think we can move for summary judgment and win right now.   I think the Respondents will put up a fight at trial.   And could they win? Sure. And so, yeah, I do think the rule matters beyond because I do think -- and this goes to some degree to the question of why we get into the harder hypotheticals, is because, in certain cases, there's going to be questions that need to be resolved.   So, yeah, I do think it matters beyond summary judgment. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, there could be a case where an interpretation of the law is really objectively reasonable, very, very reasonable, but there's some evidence, you know, some email or something to suggest that the -- the company thought it was not right.   So, in that case, you know, that may have to go past summary judgment, right? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " It may be.   You know, without understanding the factual record in more detail, I -- I couldn't say, but, you know, generally speaking, the existence of one email somewhere in the company is not necessarily going to be enough to defeat summary judgment. I would refer the Court back to -- this Court's decision in Omnicare gave an example of a -- a CEO who says, we believe our conduct is lawful, and the -- the premise was, well, you know, that would be misleading if you -- you hadn't consulted a lawyer, if you honestly didn't think your conduct was lawful. On the other hand, if, you know, seven lawyers told you it was lawful and one junior lawyer said, oh, maybe it's not lawful, that wouldn't be enough to make it misleading.   So it's going to be fact-intensive.   But, yes, there are situations where I think, at the margins, this could matter. The big question is, do we want to adopt a legal rule, like the Seventh Circuit, which would allow all of the evidence inside a company to say we think we're doing the wrong thing, but then a court to say, well, it doesn't matter because there was an objectively reasonable sanctuary that you weren't thinking about at the time, that you weren't relying on, but that somehow saves you. And quite similar to what this Court did in Halo Electronics, we think that's an unreasonable application of any scienter rule. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Two things.   One, in response to Justice Alito, he asks a hypothetical, you know, we think we're going to lose 51-49, and you changed that into we are probably wrong.   Those are two different things. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Oh, sure.   So, yeah, if you think -- we think we have the best interpretation of the law.   We think a court should decide it this way.

To begin, we -- we lay out in the briefs, I think, as comprehensively as we can why Safeco is just decided in an entirely different context.   A moment ago, I referenced the Halo Electronics case, and Safeco's, in its Footnote 20, were the basis for the Seagate test that was up before the Court in Halo, and this Court said, no, we're not going to extend the Safeco footnote to this distinct context of patent damages.   And the precise reasoning was you could have people who act in really subjective bad faith for whom enhanced damages were intended to be applied, and they would get away with it. The same is really true in the fraud context.   People who are intentionally trying to cheat the government, there's no realistic argument for why the Safeco -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Is that because the statute has actual knowledge in it? "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " Yeah.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " -- there is, first, the textual distinction of having a three-part definition of knowledge and it being a fraud statute.   There's the fact that it draws from the common law of fraud, which is Section 526 of the Restatement of Torts, not Section 500, which was at issue in Safe -- in Safeco.   There's the issue of the background principles of law that require those who do business with the government to determine the propriety of their claims before presenting them, a principle that's not necessarily the case throughout the entire regulated economy, where the Fair Credit Reporting Act applies. And then there's also just the way that we read that footnote, which is that we don't read it to apply in a situation where, at the moment the company made its decision, it had no inkling of the defense that it now seeks refuge in.   We read it to mean that the company contemporaneously followed an interpretation that was reasonable at the time, not that it came up with that interpretation later.

Stewart", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I -- I'd like to begin by addressing the line of questions that Justice Kavanaugh posed earlier about the -- the internal company meetings where three possible interpretations of the law were discussed. And there are really two important differences between the hypothetical and this one.   The first one is the hypothetical seemed to involve a situation in which the company was not attempting to have contact with the government but was deciding what course of action it would take and was contemplating the possible litigation risks down the road if it was sued. And what's extremely important about the False Claims Act is we're not just talking about conduct; we're talking about representations.   In the course of submitting claims, the claimant is making representations either to the federal government or, in the Medicaid and Medicare context, to state and private intermediaries, and they are describing their own practices.   And in our view, the -- the one bedrock requirement is they should not say things they do not believe to be true. And even if they think there is a reasonable argument down the road that it is true, if their best judgment is the statement we are making is not true, they shouldn't make it. The -- the second thing I'd say is the representations we're talking about here are not pure propositions of law.   In rep -- in giving figures as to their usual and customary prices, they were, in -- in essence, using a mixed term of fact and law.   They were -- they needed some legal conception of what \"usual and customary\" meant in order to do the calculations.   But the whole reason that the state agencies and the pharmacy benefit manufacturers were asking for this information was it for -- was factual information about the prices that they customarily charged to their cash customers, and that was information that the agencies and the PBMs didn't have on it -- their own.   That was information they needed to give to the company. And if the -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, you keep saying whether the statements they made and representations, and I gather there will be litigation at some point about what the representations were, but when you say something is true or false, I assume it's -- has a legal element to that determination.

Now -- now, if they had laid it out, if they had shown their work, as it were, and they had said our retail price is $20, 80 percent of our cash customers pay $4 to this drug, but our understanding of the term \"usual and customary\" is that it refers to the retail price and, therefore, we're claiming $20, if they had done all of that, there wouldn't have been anything deceitful and there wouldn't have been any real danger that the state agencies and the pharmacy benefit manufacturers would be deceived.

In this case, I think you have to go back to 2005, when all -- when -- when \"usual and customary\" had been in place for -- for many years, Walmart adopts a pricing mechanism where it discounts deeply and across the board for all generics, and the question is, what do the rest of the pharma -- pharmaceutical business do in that context? And it does it, Justice Thomas, against the backdrop that there is no usual and customary guidance.   There is nothing from the federal government that tells you what the right answer is.   And there are lots of different states that take lots of different positions. There's lots in the record in this case that says that the -- that the interpretation adopted by my clients was absolutely correct, those discounts didn't count. And the reason why I don't think you can look at this as a post hoc justification for what they did is, at the time, those -- my clients, who actually matched, directly matched the Walmart scheme and said, okay, $4 flat discount across the board, that's exactly what they charged as a usual and customary number. But, when they didn't adopt that approach, when they -- when they stuck with the -- with the individual matching programs or when they adopted membership programs that had some discounts and not some discounts in certain circumstances, in their view, their ordinary price to the customer, the person who walks in the door, rings on the bell of the pharmacist, and says, I want a prescription for Crestor, what's the price that I have to pay for it, I have my wallet here ready to pay cash, and the number is $10, and that's the number that they would report as the usual -- excuse me -- and customary.   And they did that on the basis that that is a reasonable approach, that is an objectively reasonable decision and that there is nothing, not even remotely, in the category of definitive guidance, authoritative guidance, from any agency of the federal government and certainly not from any court.   Indeed, all the courts that have decided that issue until Garbe in the Second -- in the Seventh Circuit in 2016 had held that this was perfectly okay. And -- and put it into context, alright?

And I think the statute makes that argument pretty hard, that knowing and deliberate indifference require subjective proof, proof of internal knowledge and -- and actual knowledge. And so that the law makes that an available course to meet the case for a plaintiff.   Whether they can do so here I know not.   And you may have a very good argument.

And I submit -- I submit, you know, the subjective evidence is not relevant.   And that's all the Seventh Circuit did.

I don't think the Court has to decide that issue in this case.   I think, in this case, what the Court has to recognize is that we deal in a situation where there's no guidance, we have an inherently ambiguous term, we used what was by all accounts and is, you know, is undisputed before this Court an absolutely objectively reasonable interpretation, so the number we gave was based on an objectively reasonable interpretation.

And on -- on that understanding of what -- of what -- you know, that's the basis why, when you're dealing with a case like this, the downside of saying we're -- we're going to ignore whether the actions taken were objectively reasonable, we're always going to allow subjective intent, guarantees, again, as the Solicitor General said in Safeco, you're going to have to waive the attorney-client privilege in every single case.

In the absence of textual indicia in the FCA supporting that subjective intent matters here, we apply Supreme Court precedent to interpret the same common law terms addressed in Safeco.\" In other words, we believe, says the Seventh Circuit, that based on Supreme Court precedent, subjective intent does not matter for the standard for acts committed knowingly or with reckless disregard.

I'm not saying that -- that -- that intent doesn't count ever in this litigation.   If you get past the objective reasonableness, you know, if it's not an objectively reasonable interpretation, and if it's not a -- or -- and if there is authoritative guidance that pushes against that interpretation, then the Safeco defense is not available, and, obviously, subjective intent will count, and all of those statements that say we didn't really believe that will be the basis on which the hammer of the False Claims Act will come down on them.

And as the record clearly shows, the vast majority of the pharmacy benefit managers' view of the world was these kinds of discounts don't count.   We don't take them into account as part of the usual and customary price, and, therefore, it -- it -- it is at least passing strange to come in here now 10, 15 years later, where the party on the other side, who had a financial interest, candidly, in taking the other position on that issue, pretty consistently and across the board said, no, that's fine, we understand that.   Discounts don't count. The General Accounting Office said the price -- in -- in setting the price, discounts don't count.   CMS recognized discounts don't count.   You get all that, those statements, from the federal government as to how you're supposed to proceed, and no state governments involved in this case who told us that Medicaid doesn't take into -- you know, you can't -- if you discount, you have to discount in full. I mean, that could have been a position.   You know, if the federal government wants to take that position, there's a way to do it.   It adopts a rule.   It tells everybody what the standard is, and then you're on notice, and there's no question. If they had said that any discount then becomes the baseline for all, that's usual and customary, is any baseline on any drug under any circumstances, I mean, we might challenge that rule as being inconsistent with the concept of usual and customary or just an -- an unreasonable interpretation of the law, but at least, if we went forward after that and ignored it, we would have been put on notice. Our position would obviously not be -- it would either be viewed as objectively unreasonable or we had been given guidance that said to us don't go in that direction. So I -- in -- in response specifically, Justice Alito, I think -- you know, part of it, I mean, we clearly had the opportunity or there were opportunities for information to be exchanged.   The government's view of the world is that we're supposed to come in and identify problems. And I go back to Dreeben's brief, which says you -- you can try until the ends of the day to get the federal government to clarify for you issues about which they have discretion, and they will as consistently decline to do that as is possible, allowing themselves a much broader opportunity for enforcement discretion. I mean, remember, this is a case where the government looked at this for five years, didn't intervene, seemed to be -- you know, didn't take any actions with respect to any of this ever, and then shows up here now and says, the issue is whether or not, you know, how to take this into account and the court ought to -- ought to review it under these circumstances. This is -- this is not just about this case.   This is a problem that the False Claims Act is going to present to the entire business community in ways that I think are inappropriate.

"}, {"speaker": "Tejinder Singh", "text": " There are three things that I'd like to just quickly discuss. The first is, as Mr. Phillips says, the statute says what it says, and it says something very different from the Fair Credit Reporting Act and very different from the Seventh Circuit's rendition of Safeco and the rule that it adopted.   Terms like \"objectively reasonable,\" \"authoritative guidance\" appear nowhere in the False Claims Act.   It refers to clearly subjective terms. And so I think, at a minimum, the right holding in this case is to say you should apply the statute as written.   It includes plainly subjective terms, and any rule that treats subjective understandings as irrelevant is plainly wrong. Going forward from there, there is this question that Mr. Phillips has introduced about, is there a real difference between law versus facts, and I think the answer is that sometimes there can be.   But the beauty of the subjective rule is that it accounts for that. You can subjectively be more or less sure about facts.   You can subjectively be more or less sure about law.   All of that is true. There is no need to set an arbitrary threshold of, if this particular kind of precedent was available, then you can know the law but not otherwise. What the subjective rule asks is, look at what people actually believed at the time they were filing claims.   Did they believe they were doing the right thing or the wrong thing? And that could be because of a legal reason or a factual reason.   It's one-size-fits-all. And, again, this is nice in light of the text, because the text does not distinguish between questions of law and fact.   It has one scienter standard for every reason why a claim might be false or fraudulent.   And so you should apply the same inquiry whether it's false or fraudulent. In light of that, the other side's concession that the subjective standard applies to facts is, I think, quite a helpful one for us when it comes to figuring out what standard you should apply to law.   You should do the same one because the statute only has one. Lastly, I just want to push a little bit on some of the descriptions that Mr. Phillips is offering of the record in this case. You know, he says there's no guidance, there's nothing.   But we have cited the contrary guidance, and we have, moreover, cited all of the internal communications showing that their employees understood that guidance. As Justice Gorsuch said, these are all lovely things that he should tell a jury about why they couldn't have had an idea at the time that what they were doing was wrong, but they are not a basis to hold as a matter of law that the defendant's subjective intent is always irrelevant if someone can identify an objectively reasonable interpretation. For those reasons, we would ask the Court to reverse the judgments below. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
