That plain meaning of 1608(a)(3) is reinforced by other features of the FSIA's service provisions.   Specifically, when Congress intended there to be an intermediary between the sender and the ultimate recipient, it said so.   It said that in (a)(4), where it addressed service through the U.S. Secretary of State.   It said that in (b)(2), where it authorized the service through an agent in the United States.   No counterpart in (a)(3). "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And -- and -- and, Justice Alito, furthermore, 1608(c), with the return receipt requirement, how would that square if a package was sent to me in New York City?

Now I think -- I think the fair reading when it says head of the foreign -- of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that's implying the -- an official address and not a home address.   But if it -- there -- by the way, based on my research, there aren't many countries that have a minister of foreign affairs not in the state capital.   I think there are about three. But let -- let's -- let's use an example.   Let's take South Africa, where the minister of foreign affairs has offices in both Pretoria and Capetown, but -- but, coincidentally, they -- there's also a single mailing address, but -- but in that situation, I think it would be perfectly acceptable for the package to be sent to any one of those addresses because they are all addresses of the -- of the head of the foreign ministry.

It would be like sending something Return Receipt Requested to, I don't know where, someplace in the United States? "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " Yeah.   Well, we have -- we have a rich record of the legislative history here, so we know a lot about what Congress, or -- or maybe more accurately, the State Department and the Department of Justice thought when they were drafting this statute in the mid-'70s. On -- on that point, Congress recognized that in many situations that return receipt might not be coming back, either due -- due to problems with the mail system, or a -- a declination of signing it in the foreign country. But Congress was -- was strategic, and this hierarchy they set up in 1608(a) has got number 4, which is a fail-safe option that is always available, can never be rejected. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But I'm just asking about the practicalities of this.   So I assume it would be this is before the era of FedEx and -- and all that, so did -- was there a simple way to do this with the U.S. Postal Service? And you -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " Yes.   Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- you send a Return Receipt Requested and -- and it comes back from the far reaches of the world? "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " Yes, but it did require the cooperation of the mail service in the foreign country.   And the reliability of that wasn't always assured for sure, because there are over 100 foreign countries that this thing could be mailed to, but, again, there is -- there is the catch-all. And -- and -- and -- and speaking of the legislative history, here, it powerfully confirms what I propose is the natural reading of 1608(a)(3), because Congress in the initial draft that, again, was sponsored by the Department of State contemplated delivery of the service package to the embassy in Washington, addressed to the ambassador or other head of the mission. And that led to a -- an immediate concern that it was transgressing the Vienna Convention and the inviolability of diplomatic missions.   And -- and Congress and the Department of State, therefore, changed the statute to avoid any connection with the local embassy to service of process. And this is all spelled out.   They issued a circular to every diplomatic mission in Washington in 1974 saying: Hey, we've got this draft bill, it talks about delivery to the ambassador.   We're going to change that because we are aware of the concerns about the Vienna Convention. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And yet, when the question came up to a sister nation, the U.K., they said the Vienna Convention doesn't prohibit -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " Yeah, Your Honor's probably referring to the Reyes case. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " Yeah.   That case is -- is quite different.   That case did not involve service on a foreign mission.   It involved service on the residency of a diplomatic agent who was then no longer in service and who did not enjoy immunity and there was no other way to serve that former diplomatic agent. And in the U.K. Supreme Court decision, the court expressly distinguished the situation with a service on a foreign state or the mission of a foreign state, saying that that was precluded by Section 12 of the U.K.'s 1978 immunity statute. So I don't think the Reyes case is -- is persuasive on -- on -- on the question we're addressing.   But -- but Congress purposefully changed the -- the bill that became the FSIA to avoid any transgression of the inviolability of the diplomatic mission. And the reports, the parallel reports, the House report and the Senate report, are both very express in saying we're changing the statute to avoid the Vienna Convention problem and that's why there's no delivery. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But, on that, the -- the U.K. decision did -- did speak to the inviolability.   They said inviolability doesn't send -- doesn't mean sending mail.   It means intruding into the premises, let's say, having a police officer with an arrest warrant or a search warrant, that's what the inviolability of the mission -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " I -- I agree.   I agree that the logic of the U.K. Supreme Court's decision is problematic with respect to the Vienna Convention. But I think the -- the U.K. court felt that it was boxed in with some bad facts and that it had to provide a way to have service of process against that former diplomatic agent. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If I could take you back, Mr. Curran, to the text of the statute. I mean, one of the notable things about 1608(a)(4) which is not replicated in 1608(a)(3) is that 1608(a)(4) does specify an address.   You know, it says addressed and dispatched by the Clerk of the Court to the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " Yeah.   So what -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and 1608(a)(3) does not say at his office in the Sudan. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " Correct.   So the question is, what inference do we draw from that contrast? And I submit that the -- the proper inference to draw is it confirms that everybody's thinking that the foreign minister gets served, whether it's the U.S. Secretary of State or the foreign, foreign minister, they're all getting served in their official offices in their home capital.   I think it confirms that. Also -- and this -- this might sound a little strange, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess I don't really quite understand that, because, here, they clearly thought that they had to specify when they wanted to specify, you know, at his office on -- on -- in -- in Washington, D.C. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " Yeah, but they -- they didn't say C Street in Foggy Bottom, right? "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, you know, close enough. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher M. Curran", "text": " So under the plaintiff's -- yeah, but under the plaintiff's theory, oh, if it's not precluded, then any other indirect method of service is okay too.   So maybe you can send it to the White House knowing that Secretary Pompeo visits there occasionally.   I -- I don't think -- I don't think that -- that's the answer. But -- but, furthermore, the 1973 legislative history suggests that, at that time, pre-FSIA, some courts were analogizing service on a foreign state with service on a foreign corporation.   There's even a -- a decision by the Second Circuit that has Judge Friendly on the -- on the court that reaches that exact conclusion, that it's -- the analogy is to a foreign corporation. Well, that concern and -- and the possibility that someone could try to serve a foreign corporation through a U.S. state Secretary of State was a legitimate concern at the time, and may have motivated the further specification that we're talking about, the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C., not a secretary of state in Austin, Texas. And -- and as Your Honor may know, in the Magness case, that's exactly what the plaintiffs tried to do.   They tried to serve process on a foreign state through the Texas secretary of state in Austin.   So Congress may have been trying to clarify that that's not acceptable. Now, on -- on the Vienna Convention, there's -- there's one other point I'd like to make.   The -- the scholars that we cited and the case law that we cited indicate that inviolability also addresses any effort to assert jurisdiction at a diplomatic mission. We -- we think that's pretty established.   Now our friends suggest that we perhaps were -- and maybe the SG's office as well -- were trying to obscure the 1958 commentary, which suggested that service could be done by mail, compliant with the Vienna Convention. I -- I -- I reject any suggestion we were obscuring anything.   Our -- our brief addresses in great depth the Japanese proposal voiced by Mr. Takahashi that was proposing that the actual text of the Vienna Convention, Article 22, be changed to allow service by mail. That proposal was roundly rejected. It was withdrawn and never adopted.   So the language of Article 22 as adopted by -- at the Vienna Convention, by the committee of the whole, indicates that the attendees at the convention recognized that service by mail would be a transgression of a foreign minister's inviolability, the foreign mission's inviolability. Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to, unless -- unless there are other questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Curran. Ms. Ross. "}, {"speaker": "Erica L. Ross", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start off where Mr. Curran left off, which is how other states understood the Vienna Convention when it was actually enacted.   I think we -- we see this through, as he also mentioned, the legislative history and really the drafting history of the FSIA itself because, when Congress considered this issue, this very issue, it initially had service by mail to an ambassador, which everyone understood to be service by mail to the embassy, in the first draft of the FSIA.   And that was, in fact, rejected, as Mr. Curran noted, precisely because of this concern of inconsistency with the Vienna Convention. And the way that Congress knew that there was this concern was that other states, in fact, came to the State Department and said that this was a problem.   And that's where you get the 1974 statement to the missions at Washington, D.C., that Mr. Curran also referred to. Now I think there is -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Ross", "text": " Your Honor, Justice Alito, I'm glad you asked that question.   That's exactly where I was going to go next, which is that the United States does not accept service by mail on one of its embassies abroad, and that is true even if a mailroom employee signs for the package.   So, in that instance, the United States sends back a diplomatic note, it informs the sender that we do not consider that to be proper service under international law, we will not be appearing in court, and we will not be honoring a default judgment.

Kavanaugh", "text": " But is there a more particular harm that comes from accepting it at an embassy? "}, {"speaker": "Erica L. Ross", "text": " Your Honor, I think there is an administrability harm.   Now, of course, I think the violation of international law is itself sufficient. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " I understand that, but I'm more -- "}, {"speaker": "Erica L. Ross", "text": " But even moving on from that, I think that the harm is that the United States has embassies all over the world, obviously, and sort of deputizing each of those to accept service on behalf of the United States is quite problematic. It's even more problematic if you accept a standard like the one that my friend suggests at page 34 of their brief, which is that service would be permissible at any place likely to have a direct connection to the foreign ministry.   That would open up consulates, for example.   There are countries that have 40 consulates in the United States. And so, if similar treatment were extended to the United States abroad, you could see that there would be a variety of places where service would be made.   And that, obviously, from an administrability standpoint is quite problematic. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I still don't -- I don't quite understand it in practical terms, although I see your point about the consulates, but say that the United States is sued in -- in Germany, and if process is served on the embassy in Germany, I assume that the embassy there would promptly send it to the State Department in Washington. But I also suspect that the State Department in Washington would send it back to the embassy in Germany to -- because if -- if it was necessary to go into a German court, somebody would have to find attorneys to go into the court to represent the United States in the foreign country. "}, {"speaker": "Erica L. Ross", "text": " Justice Alito, I'm not sure that's actually how it would work in practice. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, okay.   Yeah, how would it work? "}, {"speaker": "Erica L. Ross", "text": " So my understanding, Your Honor, is that the Office of Foreign Litigation actually in Washington, D.C., oversees all of that foreign litigation, and so it makes perfect sense in our system that we would want that to be coming to the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C., if at all, and in that case, under diplomatic note rather than through direct mail service. But I think it's important to note that all of these questions sort of get to this idea that, well, it might make sense for service on an embassy, maybe that will, in fact, reach the foreign minister.   But I think, in addition to the textual point that Mr. Curran made, which is, in subsection (b)(2) of the statute, when Congress expected an agent to accept service in the United States, that was actually spelled out in the statute. It's also true that in subsection (b)(3), again, another provision governing foreign agencies and instrumentalities but not governing foreign states, there is a provision for methods of service that are reasonably calculated to provide actual notice.   And so I think, when Congress wanted a looser, sort of whatever will actually get it back to the intended recipient standard, it actually said so.   And we see that, again, in subsection (b)(3). I would also point out that there was some discussion about subsection (a)(4) of the statute.   Now I -- I think Mr. Curran spoke about the -- the many reasons why Congress might have included Washington, D.C., in (a)(4) without the -- the similar statement or express statement in (a)(3). I would also just note that in the prior draft of the legislation that we've been discussing this morning, the -- service was to be made on an ambassador rather than -- or did not expressly say on the embassy, but everyone understood that to be where it would be.   And that's, in fact, why other nations raised objections to the United States, and why the United States asked -- or -- or why the State Department suggested a change to the statute. And so I think, similarly, it sort of makes sense in the evolution of the statute to understand that when Congress moved service from the ambassador, which was understood to be at the embassy, quite literally across oceans to the foreign minister, it was similarly understood to be at the foreign ministry rather than at the -- the embassy in the United States, again, because that's something that was specifically rejected.

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " As I understand it, 1608 is already a lower bar than what the United States itself asks for when it is sued or what other nations ask for when they're sued.   So it's already different process than -- a lower process than what's normally acceptable.   So what difference does it make that it's different than what you do now? "}, {"speaker": "Erica L. Ross", "text": " So, Your Honor, two responses to that, one practical, one legal. My practical understanding is that attempted service by mail to the embassies -- to United States embassies abroad happens nearly every day, and so that is actually a very large concern for us as a practical matter, whereas attempted service by mail to the State Department is actually much less frequent, just on the practicalities. As a legal matter, obviously, we think that the United States has a reciprocity interest in having foreign litigants or foreign sovereigns brought into our courts only under the same circumstances that we ask abroad. I don't think that there's a way to -- to read (b)(3) that doesn't permit service by mail to the foreign state, but -- to the foreign ministry in the foreign state, and so I think our reciprocity interests really come in where we think the text is clear under (a)(3) that you can't serve on an embassy, but -- but if, you know, there's any ambiguity there, that's where we think our reciprocity interests should be brought to bear. I would note more generally I think the United States' interests here are not only in reciprocity; they're also in consistency and predictability, which is something that this Court noted in Helmerich is especially important in the context of foreign sovereign immunity because we are bringing foreign sovereigns into our courts.

You -- you -- you say in your brief on the -- the Vienna Convention that foreign nations would be affronted by sending a letter -- someone sending a letter to their embassy.

But, on the -- the legal matter, under Vienna Convention Article 41, Section 2, diplomatic channels, which are a well-established way of states communicating with each other, never violate mission inviolability, so that simply isn't a concern. And I think this is an important point, that (a)(4) is both always available and never a violation of diplomatic immunity.

The relevant provision of the FSIA does not contain Sudan's requirement that the complaint be sent to the address of the headquarters of the foreign ministry in the foreign state.   And even if the relevant provision were ambiguous, Sudan's proposed interpretation is not necessary to comply with the Vienna Convention, which does not prohibit service by mail at an embassy.

They specify residences or businesses or last known addresses.   And, in fact, Federal Rule 4(i)(1)(b) specifies that service of documents on the United States should go to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, D.C. And so it certainly is true that, ordinarily, one would serve documents at, you know, a home or an official address, but, ordinarily, that address is specified.   And where it is not specified, our submission here is a quite modest, straightforward, textual one. It is that the embassy is an official address of the foreign ministry.   It is a component, an extension, of the foreign ministry.   It is certainly true, as Justice Alito suggested, that if you walk into any American embassy, you're likely to see a picture of the Secretary of State.

If you take a look at the critical piece of drafting history, the 1958 revised commentary, which really is the definitive commentary of the International Law Committee on the Vienna Convention, in the paragraph on which we rely, the very paragraph, they draw precisely this distinction. And the reason I would submit that they draw this distinction -- and this is also captured in Lord Sumption's opinion for the U.K. Supreme Court in Reyes -- is that there is something relating to dignitary interests about personal service, the notion that some person is going to turn up at the embassy or skulk around at the embassy and wait for someone to arrive so that they can hand them a document. That interferes with the functions of the embassy in a way that a mailing does not. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   But I -- I have a question.   And Sumption's a good judge, and so I read that and paid attention to that, but I agree with you, it's textual. That's your argument.   And I find it ambiguous, so we'll assume it's ambiguous.   I look to purpose, Justice Sotomayor did, and I -- I cut that a little against you because you had mentioned -- left one word out of your beginning.   You said you want a $300 million judgment.   You left out the word default. It was a default judgment.   And, of course, that's the concern, that's the purpose concern, that they have one ambassador, an assistant, and four people working in the mail room who are all American citizens and never even been to the country.   And they don't know what to do.   And you only have 60 days to answer.   Okay? And so who knows what's going to happen to that piece of paper in many embassies.   More than 60 days before they even get it over in their country.   All right? But purpose, I'll give you something on that, because that's not my question. Then I -- I thought: Well, can't get too far on purpose.   Not sure about consequences.   What about history and tradition? And there I asked my law clerk to go look up what other countries do, and this is what I found. I found -- of course, we have five here, Austria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, the UAR, and the Sudan, and they all say we do it the State Department's way.   Then Canada, the same. Belgium, the same.   Twenty-two countries have signed a -- a -- a -- a convention which says, in the absence of an existing agreement, service on a foreign country must be to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   Okay? That's -- so we got 22 more. And then I tried to find one the other way.   Couldn't find one.   Well, Sumption.   And what Sumption was about is what he said.   It was about a former ambassador of service in his residence.   And they say foreign states are different.   And then there's some language that helps you. And then I looked to what we did here, and what we did here is the Congress wanted to do it your way, and State wrote them a letter, and nobody says that that Vienna Convention on inviolability is clearly yours or clearly theirs.   What they say is there's an issue about it. And because -- and there is an issue. And because there is an issue, they said to Congress, the state, don't do it, this isn't the way we do it.   And after the state wrote them that letter, they changed the law.   They dropped the language that said you can serve an embassy.   Okay? So, so far, I have U.S. history.   I have at least 22 to 27 countries.   I could find nothing the other way, except arguable dictum in a case that involves something else. Now I put that long question to you because I want to give you a chance to say no, I'm wrong, there are 32 countries who do it differently, or whatever you want to say. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, I'm not going to say you're wrong, Justice Breyer, but I will address what I think were really the three parts of your question: first, text; second, policy; and, third, the practice of other countries. So, with regard to the text, as you know, our submission is quite simple.   It's not that this is an ambiguous provision.   It's that it's a broad provision.   And the best evidence of that is that in the very next paragraph, (a)(4), a location is specified and all of the statutes and rules that we cite in our brief, a location is specified. And so, if there is not a location, that does not connote ambiguity.   It connotes breadth.   And the embassy is, in the words of Justice Kagan, something special.   It is the extension of the foreign ministry in the United States.   And so it is quite a modest step to say that that is an address at which service of process to the foreign minister is proper. Now, on the issue of policy, I think that the best response to your concern about policy -- and I acknowledge that there was a default judgment in this case, though no one can dispute that Sudan had actual notice of this case and, of course, more than actual notice of the ongoing Cole litigation, which had been going on for many years, but even if you put that aside, the simple response to all of the policy considerations offered by my colleagues on the other side is that, under (a)(3), it is completely within the control of the foreign state whether to accept (a)(3) service not only at its embassies but more generally. And I would urge this Court to take a look at the policy of the United States, which we cite in our brief and we provide a correct website in our supplemental letter, it's a very brief document, which makes clear that not only does the United States not accept service at its embassies; it would not accept mail service even at the State Department. The sole ways in which the United States accepts service, if you look at page 2 of the current version of the policy, is either through diplomatic channels or through the Hague service convention, which is what (a)(2) refers to. All we are saying is that if this Court gives full effect to the language of subsection (a)(3), a country can adopt such a policy and implement such a policy.   And if, for instance, some letter or package got inadvertently signed for, the country could send it back immediately. That is, of course, not what took place here.   In all three of the lawsuits, Sudan signed the receipt.   You can take a look at the Joint Appendix at page, I believe, 74, and see the return receipt for yourself.   And so a country can avoid (a)(3) service, if it so chooses, either altogether or at the embassies. Now, with regard to the practice of other countries, I would certainly acknowledge that (a)(3) is an unusual provision under any of our interpretations.   Service of process by mail is not provided under the laws of many other countries. It is true that a number of countries do provide for service of process by mail on diplomatic personnel where it's a complaint against diplomatic personnel, and that is, of course, the upshot of the law in the U.K., as Lord Sumption discusses in paragraph 15 of his opinion. But I think that that illustrates why the government's interest in this case is unfounded.   U.S. law has been non-reciprocal since the FSIA was enacted in 1976.   U.S. law has permitted service of process by mail where many other countries do not.   And yet there is no evidence of some form of retaliation against the United States, and I think it is highly unlikely, with all due respect -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, I didn't talk about retaliation, you see? So now where I am is -- because I -- you'll see what I'm going to say in a second, but -- but I -- I think that -- that, yeah, maybe my purposing was -- I'm not sure how overstated, because I do worry about these small embassies, but text, you can't get me too far.   You -- I mean, it's -- it is ambiguous. But I still have the simple fact that every other country in the world has a different policy and we did too.   And now you point out correctly that there are other ways that they could get to this same policy elsewhere in the statute if they want to. And the problem is -- and I -- maybe I -- I mean this seriously, and I don't mean it to be facetious -- Botswana perhaps does not have a lawyer like you.   And to turn over to these countries, often very small, often without adequate legal advice, something that departs from a simple legal rule that every one of them has followed in one form or another in the past is something that makes me nervous.

One thing they can do is, if the package gets transmitted to the foreign ministry and someone sees it and says we should not have accepted service, it could be returned immediately.   And applying ordinary principles of rescission, we're aware of at least one district court decision in which a court has said: Well, you returned it right away, and so we're going to treat this as if service was not effective. But I think more importantly -- and, again, there is evidence of this in the lower court case law -- if a country after the fact does not, in fact, transmit the service packet appropriately, the country can come in and object to any default or to a subsequent default judgment in the country -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But those are all subject to the discretion of the district court.

Would it apply to the Number 2 person in the embassy, the Number 3 person in the embassy? They all have a direct line of communication. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I -- I think that the -- the better view is that if it is an official address of the foreign ministry that is likely to have a direct line of communication -- and I think Mr. Curran agrees that it has to be an official address, so a home address or other address would not qualify -- I think that that would satisfy our standard. But I think that if this Court were concerned about that breadth -- and I'll explain in a minute why the Court shouldn't be -- it could draw a line around embassies because embassies certainly perform the full panoply of functions of the foreign ministry. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, but, counsel, if we're concerned about the text -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Shanmugam, can we back up? And this is -- are we -- we talking about a question of personal jurisdiction? What is the basis of subject matter jurisdiction in these suits? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " So the basis for subject matter jurisdiction is the waiver of immunity.   And, in fact, there is a federal cause of action uniquely for victims of terror attacks against state sponsors of terrorism under Section 1605(a). It is true that this issue of service goes to personal jurisdiction under -- I believe it's Section 1330(b).   And so this is a personal jurisdiction issue. I do want to say one last thing in response to Justice Alito before I forget, and that is that, you know, if the Court is concerned about consulates and U.N. missions, again, the Court could distinguish embassies on the ground that embassies perform a unique function.   And, of course, a country could adopt a policy of not accepting service at its consulates or at the U.N. mission. As a practical matter, I don't think it's going to matter very much, and we did look at the case law, and I think we found around three cases where parties have attempted service at consulates or U.N. missions.   And I think the reason it wouldn't matter is that if there is an available address in the United States, i.e., the embassy, there's not going to be any need to attempt service on the consulate or on the U.N. mission in New York rather than in Washington, D.C. And I do think that one factual point here bears emphasizing.   This method of service was first attempted by my co-counsel, Mr. Hall, in the Rux case in 2004.   The reason that we attempted service at the embassy was for the simple reason that, in 2004, Sudan was at the tail end of its Civil War and it was very hard even to find someone who would deliver a package to Khartoum with the requisite return receipt. And so this case really illustrates why this policy makes sense.   It makes sense because the embassy is, indeed, the extension of the foreign ministry in the United States, and it can choose how it wants to process or transmit a service package when it is accepted. There's no requirement that it use a diplomatic pouch.   And in 2018, there are faster ways of making the transmission.

The question is, how are you going through the foreign ministry? And, indeed, if you take a look at the regulation, if you're interested in (a)(4), I think the government's own regulation is quite informative.   It's 22 CFR 93.1.   It's cited in the briefs.

"}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " In your research, did you find a single example, any example of someone tried (a)(4) and they couldn't get it done? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I'm not aware of an example.   I can't say that I've actually researched that specific question, but, of course, we're interpreting above all a federal statute here.   And Congress established a hierarchy. And, Justice Breyer, to the extent that (a)(3) is unusual, I think the telling fact is that Congress preferred (a)(3) service to (a)(4) service.

And, of course, that's not an unlikely possibility in the event of a state sponsor of terrorism, which is, after all, the context in which (a)(3) is most likely to be significant.

And it certainly is true that there, with any luck, one of these mechanisms is going to succeed.   And (a)(4) does exist as a fallback. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

Kavanaugh", "text": " Counsel, the point -- the point you're making is it's not a big deal to allow service at an embassy, even though the United States objects and even though, as Justice Breyer points out, no other country appears to allow that. And -- and my response in addition to that is, is it really a big deal to, from your perspective going forward, I know about this case, but going forward as a system, to go through the (a)(4) mechanism rather than (a)(3) at -- at an embassy? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, I would flip that around and say that it's not a big deal to permit service on the embassy under (a)(3) -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But that -- "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " -- precisely because a country can adopt a policy and simply decide not to accept (a)(3) service. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But I -- if I were starting afresh like the Chief Justice's first question, I -- I might agree with you, but the United States and all the countries in the Vienna Convention all seem to say, actually, it is a big deal. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " But I think that there are two separate questions.   The first is, does the Vienna Convention prohibit service of process by mail? And there I would respectfully submit that all of the relevant indicia -- the language of Article 22, the drafting history, the commentary, including the U.K. Supreme Court's decision in Reyes -- point in our favor. The second is, what is the current practice of other countries? And while it is certainly true that (a)(3) is unusual with regard to lawsuits against foreign sovereigns, I don't think that it's as unusual with regard to lawsuits against diplomatic personnel, like the lawsuit at issue in Reyes. So the idea of service of process by mail is not somehow alien.   It's just that Congress, in adopting (a)(3), did do something a little bit unusual in providing a mechanism for service of process by mail, even for litigation against foreign sovereigns.

Shanmugam", "text": " Well, I think that's a question for Mr. Curran, but we would certainly have to start over in this case.   And I think that the reason why that is particularly inequitable here is because, in this case, we would essentially be held to have failed to serve properly by failing to comply with a requirement that does not appear on the face of the statute and in a context in which Sudan unquestionably had actual notice of the litigation. And, again, as this case comes to the Court, it comes to the Court on the assumption that Sudan accepted service here, notwithstanding Sudan's late effort to cast doubt on that proposition.   And so, notwithstanding Sudan's judgment to accept service under (a)(3), we would have to start over at this late phase. And we're not even talking about an objection that was raised in the underlying litigation.   We're talking about an objection that was raised in the very -- at the very last minute in response to turnover orders.   And that would be the height of unfairness to the Cole victims.
