[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1323, June Medical Services versus Russo, and the cross-petition, 18-1460, Russo versus June Medical Services. Ms. Rikelman. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about respect for the Court's precedent.   Just four years ago, the Court held in Whole Woman's Health that the Texas admitting privileges law imposed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The Louisiana law at issue here, Act 620, is identical to the Texas law and was expressly modeled on it.   After a trial, the district court ruled Act 620 unconstitutional, finding no material differences between this case and Whole Woman's Health.   On burdens, it found that Act 620 would leave Louisiana with just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions.   At the same time, it found that Act 620 would do nothing for women's health. In reversing the district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit committed two fundamental errors.   First, it usurped the role of the district court and disregarded nearly all of its factual findings.   Second, the Fifth Circuit accepted legal arguments that this Court rejected four years ago. Nothing, however, has changed that would justify such a legal about-face.   In fact, even more medical organizations have joined the AMA and ACOG to say that admitting privileges impose barriers to abortion with no benefit to patients and that this impact is not state dependent. Finally, the state's eleventh-hour objection to third-party standing runs up against still more binding precedent.   The Court squarely held in Craig versus Boren that such objections are waiveable, and the state deliberately and strategically waived the issue in the district court.   And even if the state could get past waiver, denying standing here would contradict decades of this Court's precedent in numerous areas of the law. In short, Petitioners have third-party standing, especially because Act 620 restricts abortion by regulating them, rather than their patients. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Would you have done anything different if it had been -- if the third-party standing had been timely raised? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Your Honor, we certainly could have submitted additional evidence in the court, but we believe that the evidence that is already there is sufficient to find third-party standing. This Court has squarely found third-party standing in at least four abortion cases that are on point, as well as a number of other cases such as Meyer, Craig, Carey, and the Court's cases have been consistent in saying that a plaintiff who is directly regulated by a law has third-party standing. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Would you agree with the general proposition that a party should not be able to sue ostensibly to protect the rights of other people, if there is a real conflict of interest between the party who is suing and those whose rights the party claims to be attempting to defend? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " No, Your Honor, not if that party is directly regulated by the law in question.   And, in fact, this Court has allowed third-party standing in cases where the state argued that the third parties were protected by the law and in a sense protected from the plaintiffs. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Really? That's amazing.   You think that if the plaintiff actually has interests that are directly contrary to those of the -- those individuals on whose behalf the plaintiff is claiming to sue, nevertheless that plaintiff can have standing? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " If the plaintiff is directly regulated by the law.   This Court has allowed an attorney to bring third-party claims against a statute that capped attorneys' fees in favor of clients. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, that's amazing. Let's -- I mean -- I -- I -- suppose -- I know you think that the admitting privileges requirement serves no safety purpose, but suppose that the regulation that was being challenged was one that a lot of people might think really did serve a safety purpose. Let's say we're in a state where physicians' assistants can perform abortions, and a -- an abortion clinic wants to challenge the training requirements for physicians' assistants.   It just thinks those are too onerous and there's no justification for them. Now, if they're wrong about that, it implicates the interests of the women who may want to get an abortion, but you would say the clinic nevertheless can sue on behalf of those women? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " This Court has squarely held in many cases that a plaintiff directly regulated by the law can sue, and those cases make sense for at least two reasons, Your Honor. First, because a plaintiff should not be subject to severe penalties under an unconstitutional rule.   And, second, if the plaintiff is the one directly regulated, then they're -- it makes sense that they are the appropriate plaintiff. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And that -- "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " And that's clearly true -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " That sounds -- that sounds like a direct standing, not third-party standing.   But in this case, is there anything like the conflict that Justice Alito had mentioned? Is there a conflict? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " No, Your Honor, there is not even a plausible conflict in this case because this Court already held that admitting privileges served no medical benefit, and the district court here, after a trial, specifically found that this law would serve no benefit and, in fact, would harm the health of women in Louisiana. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But, you know, your argument is using the merits to defeat -- to -- to support standing.   There's a serious problem with that. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " No, Your Honor.   I believe it's the state that's collapsing standing and merits.   And, again, this Court has allowed third-party standing in cases where one could argue that the state law in question was protecting third parties from the plaintiffs. In addition to Triplett, that was the issue in Craig versus Boren.   The law there was a state law in Oklahoma, and the state claimed that it was designed to protect young men from buying beer in order to make sure that they were safe and didn't get into traffic accidents. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- is this -- I -- I'm just wondering, are these doctors in any different position than potential plaintiffs, women, who feel burdened by this law? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " No, Your Honor.   And, in fact, the state has not pointed to a single thing that would have been different if one woman had been joined in this lawsuit. To the contrary, the issues that the state says are the key issues in this case, whether this law serves health and safety benefits and how difficult it is for physicians to obtain privileges, are issues that the physicians are particularly well suited to litigate. And, again, this is a law -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So the point is you have standing on behalf of those women who feel burdened? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " To the extent that other women may not have brought a suit, that's irrelevant to the fact that there are some, those burdened, who could have and would have, if situations had permitted them to? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's absolutely right -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, then -- "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " -- Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- why can't -- why shouldn't they be the ones to bring suit? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Your Honor, this is a law that restricts abortion by regulating the physicians, rather than their patients.   And so it's appropriate for them to be the plaintiffs here. Again, the -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " -- state has pointed to -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- the -- the constitutional right at issue is not a constitutional right of abortion clinics, is it? It's a right of women. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct, Your Honor, but in order for women to access their right to abortion, they need to be able to access those services. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Do -- do you think a party can have third-party -- there can be third-party standing if there is no hindrance whatsoever to the bringing of suit by the people whose rights are at stake? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " This Court has allowed third-party standing in cases where the law directly regulates the plaintiff without a showing of hindrance.   For instance, in Craig versus Boren, there was clearly no hindrance. But I would also say that the Court doesn't need to reach these issues here because the state strategically and deliberately waived third-party standing. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I think that's highly debatable that they waived it.   They certainly didn't raise it in the district court, but whether they -- they affirmatively waived it is quite debatable. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Your Honor at JA 45, the state explicitly conceded third-party standing and urged the district court to reach the undue burden claim, saying that it had a keen interest in removing any cloud upon the validity of its law, that this case was the proper vehicle for doing so. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It's a -- it's a highly debatable interpretation of that passage, which I've read numerous times. What the state was saying was that the -- while the temp -- if a temporary restraining order was issued, the lawsuit should continue to go forward.   And they said there wouldn't be an impediment to the lawsuit going forward, because the doctors would have standing. And what I think they may have been saying in that instance is that they would have standing under the law that was applicable at that time.   We -- and we could debate what was actually said, but I think it's quite a stretch of the record for you to say there was an affirmative waiver. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Your Honor, at JA 45 there was a deliberate waiver.   And the -- and the state did it strategically because it was attempting to take advantage of favorable Fifth Circuit precedent at the time because the Fifth Circuit had just upheld the Texas admitting privileges law. Again, the state specifically urged the district court to decide the undue burden claim, saying that this case was the proper -- proper vehicle for resolving the constitutional issues and that any delay wouldn't serve judicial efficiency. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It wasn't raised in -- in the district court or in the court of appeals.   It was -- it cropped up in a -- wasn't it a cross-petition for cert? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And might you have, if you had a timely notice, just as insurance, joined a patient or two? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   And, in fact, it would be profoundly unfair to allow the state to raise the objection for the first time five years into this litigation after it urged the district court to decide the undue burden claim and then pursued the undue burden claim through multiple rounds of appeals. It didn't even raise the issue when this case came before the Court in 2016 on the stay.   The first time that it raised an objection was when it filed its cross-petition for cert. And, again, at JA 45, it deliberately and strategically waived this issue. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " How many abortion cases has -- has the Court either expressly or silently allowed the doctors to sue on behalf of the women? I -- I counted eight, but maybe that's overstating it. How many abortion cases in this Court? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " At least eight, Your Honor.   And I believe at least four of them squarely allowed standing in precisely these circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So if we didn't in this case, it would require either directly or indirectly overruling eight cases of this Court? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct.   And, in fact, in Danforth and Akron the same type of law was at issue.   It was a law that the state claimed was designed to protect the health and safety of women but the Court allowed the physicians to bring the claim and to show that, in fact, the law didn't further health and safety. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " In how many of those cases did the Court discuss the issue of conflict of interest? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " The Court in Danforth specifically said that the plaintiffs had standing.   It wasn't discussed in terms of the words conflict, Your Honor, but, again, the same types of arguments were in front of the Court -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Was it -- "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " -- because the state -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Was it a footnote in Danforth? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " I don't believe so, Your Honor.   I believe it was a foot -- footnote in Akron but in Danforth it was -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You made a point about Craig against Boren, that the ostensible purpose of the law was to save the vulnerable young men from the evils of 3.2 beer? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct, Your Honor, and the Court allowed the saloon keeper to bring the third-party standing claim.   Again, in Triplet the Court allowed an attorney to challenge a law designed to cap attorneys' fees. And in Carey the Court allowed a mail order contraceptive company to challenge a law that was designed to limit the prescription of contraceptives to pharmacists, again, claiming that that was about protecting the health and safety of people. So the Court has allowed third-party standing in many cases that are squarely on point. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, do you agree that the inquiry under Hellerstedt is a factual one that has to proceed state-by-state? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Your Honor, I think that facts may vary, but what we know is that the district court held a trial here and found that there were no material differences between this case and -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, no, I know, but if -- if the issue, the statutes are on the books in other states, and if the issues are raised there, is the same inquiry required in each case? You have to have the district court examine the availability of specific clinics and the admitting privileges of doctors so that the litigation could be -- the results could be different in different states? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Two points, if I may, Your Honor.   This Court held in Whole Woman's Health that the Texas admitting privileges law was medically unnecessary and its burdens were undue.   That holding should clearly apply to Louisiana's identical law, and certainly the Court's reasoning is applicable in Louisiana. Now, the burdens of a law may vary, but a law that has no benefits and doesn't serve any valid state interest is much more likely to impose an undue burden.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " If a -- if a state passed an admitting privileges law therefor, and suppose a state had ten clinics and two doctors for each clinic, but all 20 doctors could easily get the admitting privileges, so that there'd be no effect on the clinics, no effect on the doctors who perform abortions, and, therefore, no effect on the women who obtain abortions, would a law be constitutional in that state? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That law may still be unconstitutional if it's restricting access because of the 30-mile limit, Your Honor, but that's very different from the situation here where the district court concluded -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " If it didn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- if it didn't, though, put aside the 30-mile, assume all the doctors who currently perform abortions can obtain admitting privileges, could you say that the law still imposes an undue burden, even if there were no effect? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That law would have no benefit, Your Honor, and it may pose a much harder question than this case. But in this case the district court after a trial explicitly found that the burdens of this law would be severe, and it would leave only one physician to serve 10,000 people per year in the entire state.   And the -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, the Fifth Circuit went through what the district court had said about the various doctors.   And it was proper for the Fifth Circuit to review the district court's findings for clear error, was it not? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   Clear error is the standard.   And we believe that the district court's findings are more than plausible under the standard here. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, let's take one example.   Let's take Doe Number 2.   Doe Number 2 is a plaintiff in this case, right? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So he had -- he didn't have -- it would be counter to his own interests for him to make a super effort to get admitting privileges, wouldn't it, because he'd be defeating his own claim?

"}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " He testified that he didn't apply for admitting privileges there because it's a Catholic hospital; isn't that right? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That was part of the testimony.   But, in addition, the bylaws of that hospital showed that there would be admissions requirements that Doe 2 couldn't meet. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Well, he testified directly: I did not apply there because it's a Catholic hospital.   Is that not correct? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct, Your Honor.

"}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " He has admitting privileges that require 50 admissions per year which he is able to satisfy because he has an obstetrics practice.   And that's why he was the only physician with privileges. The state's own credentialing expert in this case conceded that outpatient physicians like these who never intend to treat patients in the hospital will not be able to get privileges, and the hospital bylaws included many criteria that these physicians could never satisfy -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " When Doe -- "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " -- including residency. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

"}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " He did, Your Honor. Doe 2 focused his efforts on hospitals where he thought he had the best chance of obtaining privileges.   He had had privileges at LSU and wasn't even able to get privileges there. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Did the district court mention any of these facts? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   The district court's opinion was very careful, and its -- its decision and finding that these physicians would not be able to get privileges was based on at least four points. One, the fact that they applied and attempted to get privileges at 15 hospitals over one-and-a-half years. Two, that the state's key credentialing expert conceded that physicians who never intended to treat patients in the hospital will not get privileges. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Footnote: That's Doctor Number 6. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " All of these physicians are outpatient physicians, Your Honor.   I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, but Number 6 is only a medical doctor. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " He hasn't done any surgical procedures since 2004 and 2005. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct.   And the state's expert also conceded that a physician who provides only medication and counseling would never be able to get privileges. In addition, the district court's burdens findings were supported by what happened when this law actually took effect for a brief time in 2016 and abortion access in Louisiana was devastated. And, of course, the finding of every district court that has held a trial on a similar law has been that these laws will restrict access to abortion.   And here the district court found that this law would leave Louisiana with just one clinic in one state to serve about 10,000 people per year. And that would mean that hundreds of thousands of women would now live more than 150 miles from the closest provider.   And the burdens were actually more severe than this Court found in Whole Woman's Health. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can we go to Doe 3, the doctor who had the active OB-GYN practice? He's only a part-time doctor in Hope. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There's been much talk about his statement or findings by the district court that he was a superseding cause to the Act because he, on his own, will not practice in that -- in Hope if this law goes into effect because he would be the only doctor. But putting that aside, he also testified -- I'm sorry -- the Hope manager testified that he only does a limited number of abortions, and without the other doctor, that clinic would have to close. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's absolutely right, Your Honor.   The district court found that without Doe 1, the primary provider at Hope, Hope would not be a viable going concern. So regardless of Doe 3's testimony, Hope would have to close because Doe 3 was providing fewer than 30 percent of the abortion services of that clinic. The primary provider was unable to get privileges, and Hope would close, meaning that women living in northern Louisiana would now have to travel hundreds of additional miles, for a law that has no benefit, in order to access abortion services. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Could I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There's no dispute here about Doe 1. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The other side, that finding it says it's right.   Now Doe 3, whether or not he would quit or not, the clinic would have to close because it wouldn't have a Doe 1? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So, at least with respect to that.   With respect to Doe 6, that's a medical doctor only who hasn't been in a hospital for over ten years.   So it seems implausible, given that every single hospital mentioned by the district court in that area has requirements of in-patient -- of receiving patients by the doctor, and he can't fulfill that under any circumstances, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Can I follow up on the Chief Justice's earlier question and mine as well? Are you saying that admitting privileges laws are always unconstitutional, such that we don't have to look at the facts in -- state by state? Or are you saying that actually you do look at the facts state by state, and in some states, admitting privileges laws could be constitutional, if they impose no burdens? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Your Honor, the burdens may vary, but a law that has no benefit and serves no valid state interest, which is what this Court held in Whole Woman's Health, is much more likely to be an undue burden.

The medical consensus against these laws is clear. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " So your view is that they're unconstitutional in any state, regardless of the facts? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " They certainly serve no valid state interest.

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- different if -- if they did something as limited as, for example, you have to be admitted somewhere, because some -- being admitted somewhere does further credentialing benefits? But this was you have to be admitted within 30 miles.   Some of these doctors were admitted further away, but they still were credentialed by someone, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's correct, Your Honor.   If credentialing were the true goal of this law, the 30-mile limit would make no sense. And one of the practical real-world impacts, if this law were to take effect, is that women in the Baton Rouge area would now have to travel 320 miles back and forth to New Orleans to see the same exact physician that they previously could have seen -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How many -- "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " -- in Baton Rouge. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- miles from the northern -- from the Hope area? "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " It's 320 miles, Your Honor, from Shreveport to New Orleans.   And from Baton Rouge back and forth, because of the two-trip law, it's 320 miles.   And, again, they would be making that trip to see the same exact physician who had been previously providing services in Baton Rouge.   And that has no benefit to women's health.   It will only hurt their health, which is exactly what the district court found here. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You haven't mentioned, and it's odd, the 30 mile from the clinic, when most of these abortions don't have any complications and the patient never gets near a hospital, but if she needs a hospital, it's certainly not going to be the one near the clinic.   She will be home. "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And so -- "}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " That's exactly right, Your Honor.   That's what this Court recognized in Whole Woman's Health and one of the reasons why it concluded the law is medically unnecessary, because the -- the complication rate is extremely small to begin with, but when complications do occur, it's almost always after the woman has been left the clinic. And the standard of care at that point is for her to go to the hospital closest to her home.   And, of course, about 40 percent of abortions in Louisiana are medication abortions, and any complication from those abortions will always happen when the patient is at home, which, again, is what this Court recognized in Whole Woman's Health. And that is one of the reasons why the AMA and ACOG are clear that these laws have no medical benefits whatsoever and only impose barriers to abortion.   And that is true in every state, regardless of the state circumstances. These laws will always put barriers to abortion while serving no health and safety benefits.   And, in fact, the district court here found that abortion in Louisiana in the years before the law was extremely safe, with a very low rate of complications, that Hope had an excellent safety record, and that its physicians were competent and qualified to provide abortion services. And, again, it concluded that there is no basis to distinguish this case from Whole Woman's Health and instead the burdens of this law would be even more severe than the Texas law that this Court struck down in Whole Woman's Health.

And the court heard testimony about that and rejected the state's allegations after listening to the clinic's administrator and looking at the evidence in the record.   It concluded that Hope has an excellent safety record and that its physicians are qualified and competent. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. General Murrill. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Murrill", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit correctly held that the plaintiffs in this case failed to carry their burden -- their heavy burden of proof that is required to facially invalidate a state law. Louisiana's decision to require abortion providers to have admitting privileges was justified by abundant evidence of life-threatening health and safety violations, malpractice, noncompliance with professional licensing rules, legislative testimony from post-abortive women, testimony from doctors who took care of abortion providers' abandoned patients. The substantive due process claim that plaintiffs assert on their patients' behalf hinged upon their assertion that they would not be able to get privileges, but they can and they did.   Their claims also fail for an independent reason. So they do not meet the modern, rigorous rule for third-party standing.   So, instead, they invite this Court to exempt them from the rule. This Court should decline to make abortion providers unique among federal plaintiffs and reaffirm that even abortion providers must comply with the same rules as all the other litigants. Doctors and healthcare providers and healthcare facilities are heavily regulated for ethics reasons and for consumer protection.   And in this context, the conflict between the plaintiffs and the individuals that the law seeks to protect should defeat the close relationship prong of third-party standing. Apart from that conflict, the record shows that they do not have a close relationship with their patients and individual women have litigated abortion cases on their own for decades. I'd like to first address why this case is different from Hellerstedt and then address standing and waiver. The -- the -- the state presented abundant evidence of how this case is different. The law was different, the facts are different. The regulatory structure is different.   And the record is different.   And all of those things dictated a different result. So the Fifth Circuit focused on -- one of the things that the Fifth Circuit focused on was credentialing.   The record in this case demonstrates that there is no credentialing that is performed by these facilities.   They alleged that they had robust policies, but they don't read them and they don't follow them.

It could rest, too, it could rest on a general view that they don't want abortion providers in that hospital.

To you, Justice Alito, that the plaintiffs may bring this suit even if there is a potential or actual conflict of interest with Louisiana women.   And to you, Justice Kavanaugh, that this law would be unconstitutional even if all providers in Louisiana already had admitting privileges or could easily get them. I do think, though, Petitioners did acknowledge what is in the Court's cases, which is, to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, that the burdens may vary by state.   At that point under the substantial obstacle test, we ought to be talking about Does 2, 5, and 6, and how much of a burden there actually was on them, instead of pivoting to the benefits. And to -- to you, Justice Alito, that's not a clear error question.   Nobody disputes what the doctors did.   We're all agreed on the facts.   There's no factual dispute about what the doctors did and didn't do.   It's about how rigorously we -- we're going to -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But what sense -- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B.

Again, that's going straight to the benefits and bypassing the burdens, not looking first to whether there's a substantial obstacle. But to go straight to your question, all admitting privileges requirements of which I am aware, and they're fairly uncontroversial in the medical field, have some distance limitation.   And I think the -- the benefits that they go to, the most obvious is the continuity of care, right, because you want the doctor to be able to admit them at some nearby hospital, and at least in some rural areas, there isn't always a hospital right around the road, so whether you draw it 15 or 20 or 30 miles.

So even Doe 3 thinks of that as a best medical practice.   Now, granted, we don't know how often it happens and, Justice Kagan, I'm prepared to concede that it may not happen all that often.

Indeed, in the country people have very strong feelings and a lot of people morally think it's wrong and a lot of people morally think the opposite is wrong. And in Casey, and the later cases, I think personally the Court is struggling with the problem of what kind of rule of law do you have in a country that contains both sorts of people.   Not -- all right.   So, therefore, I take Casey as given. And I think eight cases where you've given standing, I mean, we could go back and reexamine Marbury versus Madison, but really we have eight cases in the abortion area, we have several cases in other areas, and Whole Woman's Health picks that up.   Casey picks that up.   And you really want us to go back and reexamine this, let's go back and reexamine Marbury versus Madison. And -- and you have good arguments.

Wall", "text": " I think if you look at the joint commission standards that are in the record, but my only point to the Chief Justice was that however we -- however we think about that, they can vary depending on how the credentialing system works in a particular state. If I can just make one last point on the merits.   I -- I don't really think it's a clear error standard, Justice Alito.   It's how rigorously are we going to review pretty modest efforts. Doe 2 did not apply to a hospital where he used to have privileges and Doe 3 currently has privileges. Doe 5 got privileges at Touro Hospital in New Orleans and just needed to get a covering doctor in Baton Rouge.   And Doe 6 didn't apply to Touro in New Orleans where Doe 5 has privileges.   So Doe 5 did the thing that Petitioners are here saying can't be done. And it's hard to figure out what the basis for distinction is, because the -- the cites they give in their brief, and it's pretty general and pretty thin, to be honest, but when you really trace it back, it seems to be the hospital bylaws. And Touro, as best we can tell, seems to have bylaws that look like the ones that they say would keep people from getting privileges. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " The answer -- each of those has an answer.   I mean, they say, look, the ones who didn't get the -- did get the privileges practice in OB-GYN practice, and so they had women who, in fact, were admitted to hospitals.

And on the other one, as far as, I mean, Doe 2, Doe 2 says I -- I -- I tried to get a covering doctor.   He said no.   The other covering doctors, there's no point because I'm in Baton Rouge -- is that where he was, I think, Doe 2 -- and he said, look, it's a tougher climate here.   Really tough for people who perform abortions.   Quite different from New Orleans. And I was told by one that don't do it because you try to get the covering doctor and that doctor would be subject to picketing, dah-dah-dah.   Okay.   We have all seen that. So we have gone through it.   We'll go through it more.   What do you want to say? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " So I -- I think Doe 2's in -- in Shreveport.   But far more importantly, what I would say is this: In a pre-enforcement setting, that sort of debate back and forth isn't enough to carry the burden. What ought to have to happen is these physicians ought to have to put their applications where their mouths are and then we'll find out, once they have applied to the full range of hospitals, whether they really can't, whether Doe 2 really can't at Christus, whether Doe 5 really can't find a covering doctor in Baton Rouge, whether Doe 6 really can't at Touro.

Wall", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, I think that's difficult to square with the fact that Doe 5, who does not have an OB-GYN practice, got privileges at Touro.   I think Petitioners acknowledge that there are not explicit patient minimums.   They call them implicit. But the kinds of requirements that they are pointing to are the sorts of things that look like they would have precluded Doe 5 and didn't.   These ought to play themselves out in a post-enforcement context, not as here. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, General. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B.

"}, {"speaker": "Julie Rikelman", "text": " Your Honor, the lack of benefits of these laws is not state-dependent. The medical consensus is clear that in no state do they serve health and safety benefits. And, in fact, even the federal government a few months ago removed an admitting privileges requirement from its regulations of surgery centers nationwide, finding that the requirement is medically unnecessary and imposes burdens. And as Justice Kagan asked, this Court rejected an alleged credentialing benefit in Whole Woman's Health.   And after holding a trial, the district court rejected that this law would serve a credentialing benefit in Louisiana. With respect to burdens, the district court found that this law would be extremely burdensome, more so than the Texas law in Whole Woman's Health.   And its finding that these physicians would not be able to get privileges is supported by at least four aspects of the record. The fact that they tried to get privileges at 15 hospitals over one-and-a-half years under the court's supervision; the fact that the state's expert conceded that outpatient physicians who don't have a hospital-based practice are unlikely to get privileges; the fact that abortion access was thrown into chaos when this law actually took effect; and the hospital bylaws themselves, which included a variety of criteria that these physicians could never meet, including residency requirements. And, finally, I'd like to point out that this is not, in fact, a pre-enforcement challenge.   The state has recognized that, including in its state papers before this Court. The district court allowed the law to take effect but enjoined its penalties and supervised the physicians' efforts to get privileges over a year and a half.   Again, the state has previously acknowledged that this is not a pre-enforcement challenge. If there are no further questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.
