Manely", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   United States courts have the power to effectuate relief in the Hague Convention cases under circumstances presented here in this international treaty.   Sergeant First Class -- First Class Chafin's appeal from the district court's decision is not moot because reversal of the district court's judgment could grant Sergeant Chafin relief in three ways, each sufficient to preclude mootness.   First, a reversal would mean that the United States is the child's habitual residence; second, the district court or court of appeals should order Ms. Chafin to bring the child back to the United States and overturn the monetary award; and, third, it would effectuate relief in the ongoing Alabama case and the Scottish case by, one, letting Alabama courts proceed to determine custody and, two, cause the Scottish court to stay or dismiss its proceeding.

Under the UCCJEA, which is what the State of Alabama would use, there is a home State requirement that the child must be presently -- six months before the action is commenced.   Not so much from the district court order, but coming down from the Alabama Supreme Court, but premised upon the original district court order, it was determined that Alabama was not the home State of the child.   So it's sort of like the traffic light that we talk about in our brief.   It would allow the Alabama courts to say-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --Now, I don't understand that.

The energy of our case is thrust into having habitual residence determination reversed and bringing the child back; but, we think that when -- the provision of ICARA that allows for the costs, the travel costs and the attorney's fees to be awarded, is also obliterated.   So that is also-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Is that done in a separate judgment?   The-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " --It's a separate order, same case.

Our energy all along has been spent exclusively on reversing habitual residence determination.

The rest is-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, then -- then, retain your tunnel vision.   And don't say that the case remains non-moot simply because of this other issue.   The other issue is either in the case or out of the case.   Now, is it part of your case? "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " --We agree with the government's position that it keeps this case alive, and it is not moot.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if you -- if you could take an appeal and got a reversal of the decision -- of the order removing the child to -- allowing the child to be removed to Scotland, wouldn't that undermine the -- the judgment for costs?   I don't understand why that would be a separate order, why that would be something that has to be appealed separately.   Why wouldn't that be included with the final order in the case? "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   I agree.   And the -- allowing the child to leave was the linchpin that allowed the costs.   Removing that impediment also removes the costs.

"}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Do you have to appeal that separately or not?   If -- if the way you answered Justice Alito's question was -- was the way you did, you are saying that it's unnecessary to appeal that monetary aspect of the judgment separately, that it goes -- it goes with the rest of it.   Is that -- is that your position? "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " Your Honor, I think that it is correct that if the -- the basis for the award is removed, then the award is removed; but, if the basis for the award remains, then it would be difficult to assert that there is some reason to appeal that award.   I don't think there is any great answer. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I think you're saying it doesn't have to be appealed separately. "}, {"speaker": "Michael E.

Given the vacated return custody order -- return order, will the Scottish court ever determine habitual residence? "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " The Scottish court has no need to determine habitual residence because that was determined by the district court. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But that order has been vacated, so can they revisit that question is really the -- the issue. "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " I don't -- they wouldn't revisit within the context of a Hague proceeding unless a Hague proceeding were brought there.   Within the context of their own custodial determination, like the Alabama court would in the divorce, there is a determination of -- of jurisdiction over the child. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But you could bring a Hague proceeding there, right? "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " We could bring a Hague proceeding there. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You could say, you know, there having been no decision in the United States, we want you to decide what habitual residence is, and we think it's in the United States.   You could do that. "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " We could do that.   The problem with that is that we're talking about different points in time.   For our Hague -- actually, his mother's Hague proceeding, she's the one that filed it -- for the mother's Hague proceeding, the time period that we're looking at was February of 2010 until the child left in October of 2011.   That is the time frame we'd really like to stay with.   That's an important time frame.   If we go to Scotland, we're talking about a different time frame.   It's a different animal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I thought you said that that time period was tolled, the period that she was in Scotland would be tolled. "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " From a United States perspective, more specifically an Alabama perspective, yes.   Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But in Scotland, it's -- it would be a custody proceeding.   Forget about the Hague.   The child is there.   The mother is bringing a custody proceeding.   And the question for that court is where is the child's habitual residence now?

And -- and the Scottish court -- our -- our briefs are filled with the citations of authority, but the Scottish court -- there is no reason to believe that the Scottish court wouldn't honor what the United States court has said about habitual residence, the case brought by the mother in the Federal district court in Alabama.   So that if that was the linchpin to allow-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But that was only for determining the Hague Convention; and, if the Hague Convention is out of it, then there is a custody proceeding.   The idea of the Hague Convention is just to get the case to a forum that's an appropriate forum to decide the custody question, right? "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " --Yes.   Custody is the second and crucial element of the Hague Convention as well.   If -- if there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Ms. Saharsky. "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Put simply, this case is not moot because an appellate decision on the merits would matter.   What the Court has been discussing today is there are various ways in which the appellate decision might matter.   There are ways that there would be a judgment that the father either did or did not wrongfully retain the child.   Part of the wrongful retention determination is the 900 -- or the $94,000 in money damages.   There is a question of whether the child might remain in the UK or be brought back to the U.S. And then there's the question of which courts are going to decide custody, Alabama or Scottish courts.   And we don't need to know precisely, and this Court doesn't need to figure out all of the different details of Alabama State law or of custody law under the Scottish proceedings.   All the Court needs to decide is that the appellate court's decision would make a difference here.   And it's -- it's just not the case that you could say it's moot because it doesn't make a difference. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But we don't know it'll make a difference without answering those questions. "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " Well, I'm glad-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I mean, you want us to -- to say it may make a difference, and that's enough, right? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " --Well, this Court has said that as long as there's any possibility of effectual relief, that the case is not moot.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, you should put it that way, then.   It doesn't -- you don't know that it makes a difference, but you don't have to know, right? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " --That's what I would say is that you don't have to know.   But just, if there is nothing else but a declaratory judgment that the father either did or did not wrongfully retain the child in the U.S., that is a piece of paper in the world that has consequences to these parties.   It has consequences in terms of the money judgment that's been entered, and it has consequences in terms of where custody will be determined.   The whole point of bringing a Hague Convention case is to get the child in the place of habitual residence, so that those courts, under their own law, can decide custody. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Ms. Saharsky, not to -- I mean, the whole object of the Hague Convention is to stop this shuttling the child back and forth.   But, because of this unfortunate situation we have where the district judge wouldn't give a stay, you're -- what you're -- what you're urging is exactly what this Convention was meant to stop.   This child has been in Scotland for 14 months.   Now, you say bring it back to the United States, and we start over.   The whole object of the return procedure is so that you get the child to a place that's a proper place to determine custody; isn't that right? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " Yes.   We share your concerns about not wanting the child to be shuttled back and forth.   And we think that the way to accommodate those concerns are by stays in appropriate cases, where the four factor test that -- with respect to a likelihood of success on the merits and a balancing of the equities is met; and, that when stays are put in place pending appellate proceedings, that those proceedings be expedited, the decisions made quickly. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And would you go further and say that if a stay is not in place, that that still does not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to resolve the case on the merits? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " Yes.   That's what we would say, that the case is not moot.   The Court of Appeals should be able to go forward with the case.   But if the case for a stay has not been made by the losing party, then the child should be returned to the country of habitual residence because a determination has been made that that's the country where the child should be, and there's not a good argument that the other side has put forth for a stay. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You agree that the ideal -- the ideal procedure would be, and I quite agree, that you have a very fast track stay pending appeal and an expedited appeal.   But there is no rule that -- that requires that, so how -- how could that sensible procedure be put in place? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " Well, we think that just under the normal court appellate rules, that that effectively is what happens using the American stay standard for a four factor test; not that there would be a stay in every case, but, when the showing, the appropriate four factor showing is made for a stay, that then a stay would be appropriate, and an expedited appeal would be appropriate.   But you can't-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, that's lovely, but there wasn't a stay here.   So what do you do when that procedure hasn't been followed?   That's the issue that we're presented with. "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " --That's exactly right. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " And do we even know that a stay would have been appropriate here? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " Well, the district court denied a stay, and petitioner did not go to the court of appeals, so we don't know-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So presumably a stay would not have been appropriate. "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " --Well, then, if that's the case, but -- but it -- but this decision actually went to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals reversed on the merits.   It would be up to the district court on remand to determine how to fix its prior erroneous decision.   And it would use the equitable authority that it has in every case to fix a wrong decision and determine what the right thing is. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But we wouldn't go back to what shouldn't have happened, that is, the district judge applying the four factor test -- or did the district -- there was an application for a stay.   It was denied, right? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " Yes.   And the district court entered a brief order; so, the district court did not go through the various factors, but presumably that is the standard the district court would have used. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could I ask a question?   Does it matter?   Meaning, whether a stay is granted or not, you are, I don't think, taking the position that only if the stay is granted is the court of appeals seized of jurisdiction.   You're saying the case is not moot, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " That's exactly right.   The mootness question and the stay questions are two separate questions.   And you don't want to have to say the person has to get a stay in every single case; otherwise, their case becomes moot.   They lose their appeal. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   Now, under the Convention, if the child -- if it goes back to the district court now to fashion a remedy, it could order return, it could decide under the Convention that bringing the child back after 14 months presents a great risk to the child under the Convention and not order the return, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " We don't think the Convention addresses that; but, the district court could make that determination using its equitable discretion. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So we just don't know what the court's going to do, but some form of relief is possible.   That's why you used the word \u201c possible \u201d.

We're glad to discuss the possibilities with the Court; but, the standard is the possibility of relief, it doesn't need to-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But they have the power, if they choose it, but they don't have to choose it; that's the bottom line, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " --That's exactly right.   The position of the other side is that there is absolutely nothing that the courts can do in these circumstances once the child leaves.   And we just think that the Convention doesn't say that.   It doesn't mandate that.   It's a question of U.S. mootness law.   And this Court has said as long as there's-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Are you aware of -- I happen to be because I know this area very well -- the English courts have an amici filed with us yesterday, and they are sort of sensibly keeping track of what we're doing and trying to adjust their proceedings accordingly and in the manner they think is most helpful to us.   Whether it is or not, I can't comment on.   Is this common in the custody area?   Is there discussions between courts about what they're doing and the why of it? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole A. Saharsky", "text": " --Well, in the Convention, there is kind of two aspects of this.   One is in child custody proceedings, under the UCCJEA, and one is in the context of the Convention.   The UCCJEA, which deals with competing States and potentially competing countries' custody determinations, has specific provisions that address cooperation and communication.

And so instead of being able in these border cases -- borderline cases, instead of being able to send the child back home, they will think, I've got to keep the child here so that the other party has the right to appeal.

Breyer", "text": " It does equate but now you've got me -- I think I'm on the same wavelength, and I think it was back just as well, let me see because Justice Ginsburg, I see the point of her answer now.   It's really fact-specific to this case that you're talking about.   So it just happens that the child has now been in Britain or in Scotland for 18 months.   And so the question of current habitual residence where they have been there for 18 months is a question of what's been happening over these 18 months, and what happened before the 18 months has absolutely nothing to do with it.   And the most that the Court of Appeals could say is that it was resident in America 18 months ago and that's no more relevant than saying that the cow jumped over the moon or some other thing.   Is has -- is that the point, is that the point?   Is that the point. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I thought that's what you were saying. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

And what I want to know, and I'm not going to find this in the treaty, I don't think, because it's not going to say whether it's 11 months or 12, but I want to know what source I look to, to show that you're right and that what happened 18 months previously has nothing to do with the child's habitual residence as of the place where he has lived for 18 months.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So everything turns, under your view, on whether or not the district court gives the losing party the 48-hour stay or whether the mother in this case decides to stay in the United States until the U.S. proceedings are done.   The incentives if you prevail are for the custodial or the parent with control over the child to leave immediately.   Even after a motion has been filed -- if a motion for a stay has been filed, that's not a stay.   Get on the first plane out and then you're home free.   That seems to me to be a very unfortunate result. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen J. Cullen", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, we don't agree, and here's why.   We don't agree because initially the district court judge did not order the instantaneous departure of this child.   She only did that after considering the motion to stay.   It was not-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, no.   I know.   But the point is that the other side says that the decision was wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen J.

[Laughter]   So there has to be at least a period before somebody can go up to the Court of Appeals and get a stay, and if you're right, what's happening during that 48 hours or 24 hours is that the parent with control of the child is trying to find the first flight out and once she does, it's all over.

But it is the answer.   The question is there is nothing left to be done.   The one remedy has been effected, Justice Alito, and what -- what brings all this into sharp contrast now is what we lodged last week.   The Petitioner, Justice Alito, himself is fully participating in the Scottish proceedings. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And it was a very young child, and the Scottish court was ready to beseize the jurisdiction.   Why would Judge Johnson not do what the treaty was telling her to do?   Get the child back to Scotland.   I found habitual residence in Scotland, and let's let Scotland move forward. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manely, you have four minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " Thank you, Your Honor.   With that, I'd like to touch on four points:   First of all, these courts have inherent authority to order the child be brought back.   It is a way of reversing the wrong decision of the district court.   When we are talking about the object of the Convention, it is in part rapid return, but that is kind of putting the cart before the horse.   The critical issue is where is the appropriate habitual residence of the child, and that is the place that then needs to make the custodial decision. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, what he says is that after 18 months in Scotland, the Scottish court will decide where is the habitual residence of the child.   We are now in August of year 2.   And what happened before January of year one is now totally irrelevant.   So even if the American courts decided prior to January of year 1 the correct habitual residence was Alabama, when the Scottish courts decide what is his habitual residence as of 18 months later, they won't pay any attention at all to that American decision because it is not relevant.   That, I take it, to be his argument, which depends on the long-time, 18 months.   So what is your response? "}, {"speaker": "Michael E. Manely", "text": " I think that may well be his argument.   I disagree with it entirely.   As was pointed out earlier, courts are quite used to having children have to transfer from one place to another.   The closest case on point I can think of-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But that was the purpose of the Convention was to cut that out.   That's the whole reason for the Convention, that they wanted to stop the shuttling of children.   Do you -- are you aware of re-return?   Your -- your thesis is that the -- that now the Court of Appeals could tell the district judge, you were wrong.   And then the father armed with that can go and get a re-return order from the Scottish court under the Convention.   Have there been instances under the Convention, was this question of re-return -- is re-return authorized assuming that there was a valid return order, at least valid when it was entered and when the child was returned-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael E.

Bringing the child back would be a part of the court's inherent authority, part of the district court or the Court of Appeals' inherent authority, and it's the basis upon which Scotland has the child in the first place.
