[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear, argument next this morning in Case 09-996, Walker v. Martin.   Mr. Marshall. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Charles Martin never adequately explained why he waited more than 5 years to present additional claims to the California Supreme Court.   As such, it was no surprise that these claims were rejected as untimely.   California employs a habeas corpus timeliness rule that merely requires reasonable diligence and disclosure.   The rule is adequate under this Court's longstanding precedents in the Ninth Circuit's decision to the contrary should be reversed. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What about the charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general 5 years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the 5 to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do have merit, sometimes they do it as time-barred, and there is no rationale to when they do one or the other. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Three brief responses, Your Honor.   The first is that to measure summary denials, you can't tell from a summary denial ruling what the Court was thinking about the time of delay.   The second point is that delay in California is only half the equation.   In California there is a substantial delay and there is also the justification portion.   So persons who operate under substantial delay still have an opportunity to justify that delay and gain the desired review. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What was the third? "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Would they have to?   Would they have to justify the delay first?   I thought there was something about, well, if the time question is more difficult, the merits are easy, there's no merit, so we just decide this-- "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " California's policy is to take a first look at a habeas petition and determine whether it has a prima facie case or whether procedural bars are apparent.   A court that is denying a case on the merits isn't necessarily saying the matter was timely, and courts should be permitted to reach whatever is the most judicially efficient method of resolving such a question without it being held against them. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So basically you are taking the position or you are conceding that the California courts are not consistent in their application of the timeliness rule? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Your brief doesn't even try to defend that position.   Are you conceding that there is inconsistent application of the rule? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " No, Your Honor.   The point that we are making is that when you look at a rule, whether you apply it or not -- or whether you impose it or not doesn't mean you are not applying the rule.   For example, when trial courts review matters under the Fourth Amendment, a decision not to exclude the evidence doesn't mean that they didn't apply the Fourth Amendment.   In this case if the trial court -- or if the reviewing court looks at the length of delay and then they may look at the justification to determine that the delay was justified. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well -- I might be speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus Resource Center brief showed that the court, the California court, did reach some cases where an explanation had not been proffered.   And so it can't be just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an explanation you won't get heard.   So what's the next step in that?   Why do they reach some and not others? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " The California Supreme Court, if the case is patently meritless -- and perhaps the procedural question of timeliness is more complex. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How could it be complex when there is no justification offered? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " The question of how long it was. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, they pointed to a certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in delay where no justification was offered, and in some they reached the merits and in others they applied a procedural bar.   So how is that consistent? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Well, the State court has discretion to determine on procedural grounds or on the merits-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Is there some Federal rule that says you have to apply a procedural ground before you decide the merits? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " --There is not. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So it's up to California which of the two it wants to use? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --And in California, if it just says \"denied\" then the presumption is that it is denied on the merits, is that it? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " That's correct, the lack of a prima facie case. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So if it's going to be denied on time bar grounds there has to be something to indicate that it's for that reason.   Otherwise we assume it's on the merits? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " That's correct.   Typically the citation is to Clark and Robbins, just as it was in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how do we know that the California court just thinks that the Federal question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it?   It may be meritorious.   How do we know they are not applying the decision to reach the merits on an arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to avoid hard Federal questions? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " First is this Court has never taken the position when measuring adequacy of assuming that the rule is inadequate.   The starting position that this Court has always taken when looking at the adequacy of a State rule is to look for evidence to see if it can be shown to be inadequate.   And I posit that there is no evidence in this case that has been presented to show that the State court is using their rule as a pretext of any kind. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Is it arbitrary and capricious for a court to take the ground of least resistance, to decide the cases on the easiest issue that's presented?   Is that arbitrary and capricious? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " I posit that it's not.   This Court endorsed in Lambrix that it's all right for courts to address the procedural default after Teague if that's a more judicially efficient method of handling the matter.   Strickland cases permit addressing either prong, whichever is easier under the circumstances.   So the State courts ought to be permitted to address habeas corpus on whatever the easiest, most judicially efficient basis is without being forced to answer a timeliness question if a case is patently meritless.   And there should be no finding of inconsistency about that.   And more importantly, summary denials, as we are discussing here, don't afford any notice to litigants of what the State's procedures are or what they are thinking because you have to guess.   You have to guess at how long the delay was, you have to guess as to whether there was any justification offered, so summary denials do not assist the inquiry.   And this Court has never endorsed using summary denials in its adequacy measure.   This Court has always looked to published State cases that explicate the rule.   This Court is looking to see whether the rule has been pronounced by the State for a certain amount of time and then all of a sudden the litigant that is receiving the imposition of the rule receives a rule that was unexpected, either because the rule was changed or because the rule was novel.   Nothing like that has happened here. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " The phrase is \"substantial delay\".   Are there factors other than temporal factors that go into whether or not the delay is substantial; that is to say, the prisoner had difficulty contacting his counsel and so forth?   Is that what the court looks at when it looks at \"substantial\"?   And is there -- are there California cases that tell us how do we define \"substantial\"? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, to both.   The kind of circumstances you are describing are exactly the kind of circumstances which makes California's rule fair, because it considers how long it takes a litigant to find his claim, get it prepared, and get it into court.   There are, in fact, concrete examples.   The Robbins case specifically provided that a 5-month window from the discovery of triggering facts to the presentation of the -- of the claim was a reasonable amount of time.   By contrast, the Stankiewicz case provided that 18 months of delay from the discovery of a declaration was substantial and had to be justified. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " When does the State think that Mr. Martin's claim became untimely? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Certainly he hasn't given any reason why he didn't present his additional claims at the time of his earlier habeas corpus challenges.   Mr. Martin went through a full round of superior court, court of appeal, and supreme court challenges, and then waited some additional years and has never explained why he didn't include these additional claims in those earlier challenges. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So you think it-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It's supposed to be filed within 60 days.   I don't -- this is along the same lines as Justice Kagan's questions.   Suppose there's the first round of habeas and then he waits 60 days and files the new claim.   Would that be substantial?   Because you are indicating that failure to include it in the first review is a factor to be weighed against him, and I think that's what the justice is inquiring about. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Yes, it does weigh against.   And it is a rule of reasonableness, and it's a discretion-based rule.   And he would have to offer, well, why didn't he include those claims earlier?   And if he had a good reason-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes.   Isn't that a separate rule?   I mean, no matter how soon, if he does it a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you can't come back with another habeas with material that you could have produced in the -- in the former habeas? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " --That's correct, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So time -- time has nothing to do with that.   It's just a separate -- a separate bar. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " California has articulated that successive petitions are a type of delayed petition.   But you are right, there is a difference in California between successive petitions and delayed petitions, and the ruling here is that he was delayed substantially.   I was just addressing the point about when they might have been timely had they been presented earlier, and it appears that in the earlier -- he didn't get a timeliness ruling in his earlier challenges.   So it appears that he could have raised them then and did not. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " --But if we can take out the second and successive aspect of this and just focus on the timeliness, when does the State think that this -- that these claims became untimely? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " It's a rule of reasonableness and diligence that's circumstantially based, and-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, you have the circumstances here, so under those circumstances when did the claims become untimely? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " --Under the Robbins case, it explains that you have a 5-month span from discovery of the claims to presentation of the claims would be reasonable. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But claims here-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The 5 months would be reasonable.   So is a year unreasonable?   Is 5 months the outer bounds, you know, assuming you don't have a good reason?   I understand that if you have a good reason, that can lengthen it.   But suppose you don't have a good reason.   When does the State think, okay, that's too late? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " There isn't -- there isn't a defined timeline.   But our position is that a defined timeline is not a necessity for adequacy.   This Court has endorsed reasons of -- rules of reasonableness and diligence.   For example, in the Federal prisoner context in Johnson v. United States, this Court said diligence in discovery, while it isn't exact, is good enough. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I'm trying to get to even around, not -- not exact.   My standard is not exact.   It's just around.   Around what?   Around 6 months, around 3 years, around someplace in the middle? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " The position of the State is that Robbins has indicated that 5 months is reasonable, 18 months is definitely too long, and that there is a discretion-based determination in the middle. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What if it's filed within 6 months and it's rejected as untimely, and the Petitioner wants to try to demonstrate that this represents a grave departure from the way these are normally handled by the California Supreme Court?   Is there any way for the Petitioner to do that? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " He would point to the published authority and argue that his case was outside of the parameters of what the State had done in the past.   However, our position is that, since California's rule is adequate, that there would be no evidence of such available to this particular litigant.   A hypothetical litigant might be able to proffer that prior cases had treated claims differently.   The other problem with California is that it would require two exact same litigants, and it's very rare for two exact same litigants to have the exact same claims, the exact same bases for their delay, and file exactly the same amount of delay.   So true comparison is difficult. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Do you think 5 years is too long, though? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " This was taken over by California from capital cases, but in the capital case context they have a 90-day presumption of timeliness.   And when they extended the capital framework to non-capital cases, they left out the presumption that within 90 days is timely.   Was there a reason for that? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Respectfully, I must disagree.   It actually is the other way around.   The capital case policies took the timeliness rule, took the general timeliness rule for themselves, and added the presumption. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Was there a reason for then saying, well, in the capital context, we are going to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely.   Why didn't they add that to the original rule? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " To the other litigant rule? "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " They, I think, felt that the rule was adequate the way it was, that a circumstantially-based rule, a reasonableness-based rule, was sufficient to guide the conduct of litigants to tell them what they needed to do to present their case. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, why would it be different in the capital context?   What was the reason for adding the 90 days there? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Capital cases are significantly more complex, the punishments are -- are more significant, and so additional scrutiny might be warranted in those contexts. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --I'm a little bit confused by your response to Justice Scalia.   I thought from your brief that you were positing that there was no claim of inconsistent application of the rule that could ever survive.   Let's assume for the sake of argument the following hypothetical, and probably not far off the mark.   Litigants who don't know the law, who claim they are not educated in it, say that they have just learned about a new California case that gives them a ground to challenge their prior sentence.   And the litigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6 months of the issuance of the case by the supreme court.   A dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review and half of them are granted review and half are not.   Half of them get a correction of the sentence and half of them don't.   There is no difference between them that's discernible.   They each just claim ignorance.   Is that a case where someone would be out of luck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " I didn't follow the hypothetical.   Was -- were some of the hypothetical individuals getting time-barred?

Is that an inconsistent application that would be cognizable under your view of the rule as it should be? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " --That sounds inconsistent to me, Your Honor.   However-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It does. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " --But such a thing would not occur in California.

No.   Why do you concede that it would be -- can't the State, if it wishes, give grace to people who did apply late, but because the case is so meritorious or for any other reason?   The issue is whether those people who filed 5 years later and knew that it was very late, whether they are entitled to have their cases heard, not whether the state allows somebody who filed 6 years earlier to have it heard.   How does that do any injustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you know, you are likely to be denied? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " I absolutely agree, Your Honor.   The basis for my earlier comments was the -- I believe the hypothetical was 3 to 6 months, which was a much shorter period of time. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I don't see why the State has to be consistent in it.   If -- as a matter of grace, it can -- it can allow some people, so long as the people who are denied had every reason to believe that they were coming in too late, and 5 years is coming in too late. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Just as occurred in this case, I absolutely agree, Your Honor.

I'm talking about treatment of similarly situated individuals differently.

The -- the rule exists-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Oh, I don't disagree with you.   So that the question I have for your adversary is whether or not he can point to any case where a litigant who proffered an -- something that was evident on the trial record and on the appellate record was ever granted a merits review after 5 years.   Because I don't see them proffering any case that shows that.   But -- and I think that may be your argument. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " --Yes, exactly.   No one-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I don't understand your answer, then.   You have -- let me just adapt what Justice Sotomayor said.   You have -- a case, a Supreme Court case is decided.   And you have ten -- ten habeas petitioners in California who file on exactly the same day.   And five of them, if you were to get to the merits of their claim under this new decision of this Court, five of them would be entitled to relief, five of them would not be entitled to relief on the merits.   And the California Supreme Court holds that the five who would be entitled to relief are procedurally barred and the five who were not entitled to relief are not, and they are rejected on the merits.   Now would that be an adequate State ground? "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " --Well, I'm not sure.   It doesn't happen in California that way. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

"}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " This Court has also required legitimate State interest, and this Court has used the legitimate State interests context, like for example in Smith v. Texas, where this Court has declared a particular kind of violation was a constitutional violation and the court exercised its discretion not to reach the violation, this Court found that the State had no legitimate State interest in such a ruling.   Our point is that-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But -- but the cases that you are using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in which the effect of the State decision was to exclude the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision.   The matter could not come before the Federal courts. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " This is something quite different.   This is applying a time limit.   I don't see why we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into the -- whether it's not discretionary.   I mean, to say it's discretionary always means that sometimes similar cases may be treated differently. "}, {"speaker": "Todd Marshall", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, exactly.

At its core is the prevention of State courts from declining to enforce Federal rights and to maintain Federal authority over the protection of constitutional rights in the Supremacy Clause.

"}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " These cases that you cite, before you go any further, are cases in which the California Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying that six years was okay?   Or are they just cases where without an opinion the California Supreme Court went to the merits?

These cases predated the Clark Robbins situation.   In the Cooper case and the Duke case, those cases-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What do you mean they were decisions, written opinions or just went to the merits and decided the merits?   Did they say anything about the delay question?

"}, {"speaker": "Michael R Bigelow", "text": " --To that extent, it's my recollection they went to the merits.   They are not silent denials and they don't cite Clark Robbins because they predated Clark Robbins.   With respect to the Cooper case and Duke case, those I believe were silent denials.   Now, and that's the interesting thing about California.   We are presuming, we are presuming and this Court has reached that presumption, that they are merit denials when they are silent, but we really don't know. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's a puzzle to me.   I mean, Justice Scalia's question was courts all the time, they all the time, they don't decide an issue of whether it's filed too late because it's the simplest thing just to decide the merits.   It's the same result.   And sometimes they don't do that.   But that happens often in a district court on appeal and triple in a supreme court which has hundreds or thousands of questions for review.   So how do we know that that simple practice, which I have never heard of as attacked as unconstitutional, how do we know that that isn't what's going on? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R Bigelow", "text": " Well, in -- in any given year recently -- in recent history at least, there are about 800 truly silent denials, no explanation.   Now, the State says, we can't consider them because they mean nothing.   From our perspective, they have to mean something, and they have to count because we don't have the information that the litigant in this matter doesn't have the same kind of resources, for example, that the State does. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But that's -- they -- what's your point?   800 are silent.   What does that show?

Are you saying it's being applied consistently or inconsistently or you do not know? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R Bigelow", "text": " It is being applied. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " In all courts below the California Supreme Court? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R Bigelow", "text": " In all courts below, I do not know. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So you do not know.   So what you have done your research on are questions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a supreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies something, but you haven't looked into the research that is readily obtainable, which is these are courts that write opinions.   Have I gotten that correctly?   Because if that's correct-- "}, {"speaker": "Michael R Bigelow", "text": " That would be a correct thing. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --All right.

Now, what can you say that will disabuse me of the notion that I just expressed? "}, {"speaker": "Michael R Bigelow", "text": " The -- the lower appellate courts, there are six -- there are six district courts, there are six appellate districts, I guess, within the State of California.   And who knows how many superior courts.   For a Petitioner to examine the holdings and the rulings in each of those districts would be virtually impossible for a Petitioner who is in prison, who is unrepresented by counsel, and let's not forget that non-capital habeas petitioners, and this is non-capital habeas petitioners, is not represented by counsel.

There was a shared expectation with what prejudice encompassed.   And so yes, it's similar, but it's not exact.   It's not the standard in California.   And if I may, California clearly understands that case law can offer guidance to litigants.   In In re Harris, a case cited by both of us, by both parties, the State of California was concerned about the Waltrius rule, which is another procedural bar.   And it went on to -- it acknowledged that it wasn't clear at that time and it went on to explain what the Waltrius rule was all about and why it was needed.   And in another case, where recently, the State of California -- in a case not cited, the Kelly case; it's a 2006 case -- the California Supreme Court directed its lower courts over which it supervises to provide greater detail in their analysis of Wende briefs, which is the State's alternative to the Anders brief, in order to provide guidance to litigants, to provide guidance to justices, and to provide -- to provide guidance to the Federal courts who may be called upon to determine procedural bars.

But those are -- those are pre-Clark decisions, if you will, and this case is relying upon, or the State act rather is relying on what has come after -- after Clark with respect to its, as promptly as the circumstances should allow.   But the other point that I would like to make, it's not as if the State of California doesn't understand the need for a finite period of time to provide guidance to -- to all parties.   In -- in Saffold, the State requested this Court presume a filing period, I think it was -- I want to say 60 days.   More recently in Chavez, a filing period was requested to be presumed again by the State.   On both occasions this Court declined because it isn't this Court's prerogative to set rules for the State.   What this Court did do is it certified the question to the State of California, or they asked the Ninth Circuit at least to certify the question to the State of California.   The Ninth Circuit did exactly as this Court asked it to do, and certified the question, and the State of California says:   \"We are not going to tell you what a timeliness period is. \"   Now that doesn't help pro se litigants with minimal education, without benefit of counsel, who are the vast majority of habeas petitioners in the State of California.
