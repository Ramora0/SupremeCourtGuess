A look-through like this best fits the history of AEDPA, it best fits the plain reading of 2254(d), and it best fits this Court's precedents. The ruling in Richter was a necessary ruling and a narrow ruling.   The question posed in Richter was what to do \"where a state court's decision is unaccompanied by an explanation.\" This Court's choice was either to require de novo review of that, utterly inconsistent with the purpose and the history of AEDPA, or to accommodate AEDPA and 2254(d).

But equally possible would be to encourage state intermediate courts to say less and perhaps take advantage of Harrington, so that no state court says anything and achieves maximum deference from federal courts, like California has, for example. Should we be concerned that a ruling in favor of look-through might actually yield if states are rational and look for the least cost and the most deference adverse consequences to your -- your -- your clients?

I think that federal -- I mean state court judges are not nearly as concerned with federal review as some say. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I understand they are, but perhaps state legislatures are.   And they may for altruistic reasons, as in Georgia -- very, very altruistic reasons, insist on a practice of some reasoned decision-making, but couldn't you see other state legislators making other decisions, say like California has, because of the cost of analyzing these cases?

Olive", "text": " We note just as -- as an aside, that's changed now in California under Proposition 66, all capital cases start in the lower court and will go through the appeals process, when that's eventually implemented. But, no, I don't think the legislatures or the courts after AEDPA are losing ground when it comes to federal habeas. And they have reasons for structuring their -- their processes in whatever way they please. And in Georgia, it's a serious opinion writing endeavor by a trial court that then is looked through, or has been for years, until two, about two years ago, by the appellate court. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So how seriously should we take a word that you read from Ylst which was \"presume,\" it says the -- the habeas court should presume that this simple, one-word statement of the state supreme court means that the decision that's keeping the person in prison is, in fact, the decision of the intermediate appellate court? Now, then if it's a presumption, the state could refute it.   And I guess is this right? The state would be free to say, well, look, here, Your Honor, to federal judges, look, this decision of the intermediate court is so obviously wrong, in any event, it's so obviously a procedural ground, an adequate state ground, and look at what they argued to the state supreme court and bring out the briefs, and say under these circumstances you shouldn't presume that that lower court decision is what the supreme court decided on. Indeed, nobody even claimed in the supreme court that they ought to just decide on that ground.   I mean, would you be free to do such -- would they be free to do that kind of thing? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " I think they would, but the state has never in Georgia disagreed that it's most improbable that the Georgia Supreme Court's decisions did not rely on -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, it's -- in Georgia, I take it, the adequate state ground is not really one -- it's not in play in this kind of situation, but there are states where it are -- it is. I don't know how well, but what -- what I've just said and what you said it would be free, is that basically the situation that most of the states use, as that's what's going on right now in the country. "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " The circumstances under which the presumption can be rebutted are probably innumerable.   And how the briefing went in the lower court and -- and other indicia are important.

It said that much of the evidence that had been proffered in post-conviction was cumulative, which it really -- there's an argument that it wasn't that I can make.

And I -- I suspect you think that some of the things that it said were wrong, but is it fair to say that in general it said, in fact, said over and over one of the reasons why we find no -- why -- why the judge found no prejudice is that taking into account all the evidence that it suggested is mitigating and all of the aggravating evidence -- and there was a lot of it here -- the addition of this mitigating evidence wouldn't change the outcome? Didn't the court say that? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " The court did say that. But it wasn't -- it didn't consider all of the mitigating evidence.   There was a -- a swath of mitigating evidence that had to do with this 19-year-old who had not, in the defense of the case, killed anyone with respect to this crime and whose lawyer said he's just been bad and led a bad life. There was, in fact, presentation at post-conviction proceedings of evidence of redeemability for this person and his good acts.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No, it wasn't, all right, it wasn't presented at trial, but it was presented to the habeas court. "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " And it was not mentioned by the habeas court. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It wasn't mentioned. "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But does that mean it wasn't considered? I mean, it does seem like -- "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What is your answer to the argument that what you're asking the federal habeas court to do really is to grade the quality of the opinion that was written? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " Well, the evidence that was offered was of institutional failure and also things like he was creative and intelligent and was struggling to break away from his past. And -- and the redeemability, this Court knows, with an 18-year-old, a 17-year-old, a 19-year-old is serious mitigation.   But, Your Honor, they -- they -- it's not a grading of what the judge did or the opinion that was written.   2254 works this way. The Court says federal habeas judges must train their attention on what was actually involved -- this is a quote -- \"in the application of this Court's law to facts.\" That's kind of a grading, but you can get a D and pass under 2254. It's just egregious actions outside the realm that no one would consider reasonable. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, so what if the -- what the habeas court did was this? They said this is all the evidence that is -- is proffered in mitigation, and this is all the evidence that was provided by the state in aggravation, and taking into account all the -- all the mitigation and all the aggravation, we conclude that there's no reasonable probability that a jury would have returned anything other than a sentence of death? Now, would that be -- would that be unreasonable because there isn't a detailed explanation? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " In -- in this case, we think it would be unreasonable.   Again, the state wrote this order.   The -- there's nothing wrong with that.   There's orders for both sides, and the judge takes it and amends it in whatever way they think necessary.   And it was a very minimal way in this case. And the order that was written and the order that was signed reduced to irrelevancy, it went through item by item various things, but when it got to the institutional failure and to the positive characteristics and traits of this 19-year-old, you can't find it.   So you can't reduce to irrelevancy under Porter important mitigating evidence, and that's what the -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " That does sound like grading -- "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " -- that's what this order did. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- so let me modify what I -- my hypothetical where there's no explanation, there's just a citation -- there's just a listing of mitigation and aggravation. There's a little bit of explanation.   There are three sentences of explanation or there's a half a page of explanation. At what point does it become, would you say, okay, well, that's enough, it's reasonable? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " Well, that's -- the level of abstraction there is difficult for me to give an answer to, but this Court has given an answer in Williams and Wiggins and Rompilla and Porter where the Court painstakingly went through the evidence on aggravation and mitigation, especially on the prejudice prong. So grading is a bad label for it, but the AEDPA says take a look at what they said and analyze it and see if it's reasonable. And the second prong of 2254(d), which I didn't mention before, the court has to grade in that you look at what the state fact findings were based upon.   So you do have to look at the opinion, you do have to analyze the opinion.   If that's called grading, it doesn't take much to get a high enough grade to pass 2254 muster for the courts. And going back to the limited holding in Richter, this Court's language shows its fealty really to 2254.   The Court says, \"Under 2254(d), a habeas court must determine what arguments or theories supported\" -- and so, if there's a written opinion, you can see what arguments or theories supported -- \"or, as here, could have supported the state court's decision.\" And so, if you know the reasons, and with look-through, our argument is you do know the reasons, if you know the reasons for the decision under Brumfeld, quoting Richter, you follow Richter where there is no opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied. And under Wetzel, this Court says taking out the second clause, a habeas -- habeas court must determine what -- or -- arguments or theories supported the state court's decision. In this case, it's -- it is clear and has been clear for years that the arguments that support -- to support the Georgia Supreme Court's denial of CPC are those arguments that are in the state post-conviction reasoned order. And if the Court wishes to -- to go beyond that, it's quite capable of doing it. It can issue three or four pages in denying CPC, and it does. It can issue a paragraph in denying CPC, explaining reasons beyond the lower court, and it does.   The Court -- if the Court wants to do it, it can do it.   It knows how to do it. Otherwise, the presumption in Ylst should be respected. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Have there been any commentary or can the bar offer us any experience as to whether or not the Richter rule, in the cases where it has applied has proven to be workable and administratable or unworkable and unadministratable? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " In Ylst -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And -- is there any commentary on how Richter has worked out. "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " I'm not aware of any commentary on how it has worked out.   It no longer really is applicable in California with respect to death penalty cases.   And the truth is in non-capital cases, they're almost all indigent, and they almost all start in the trial court and work up and they have the Ylst presumption. The workability of -- of Richter in its application in other jurisdictions, I'm not seeing commentary on, but it is, again, cabined to the unique situation which otherwise the Court might have had to order de novo review with respect to the unique situation that there be no reasons given by a court. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Now, Richter does require a habeas court, a federal habeas court to imagine all of the conceivable arguments that could have supported a state court decision, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " Yes, ma'am. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So it, by definition, requires more work. "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " I mean, it's an incredible situation to -- it would be difficult for federal district court judges, if I were one, to imagine a set of considerations that might lead to a constitutional violation, determine whether there was a constitutional violation, then determine whether it would be unreasonable to find there wasn't a constitutional violation. So it's an interesting process to go through.   Right now, the adminstrability is courts around the country that are looking at decisions from all states, including death penalty states, know the drill. They understand Ylst.   It hasn't caused any problems.   It's imminently workable. It makes common sense.   Everyone knows how to do it. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's much simpler. "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " Pardon? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It's much simpler? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " Much simpler and well-known. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Because you're not really granting habeas relief that will result in -- necessarily in the release of a defendant because, once it goes back down, the state court can then decide which among the many possibilities there are to still affirm the conviction, couldn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Mark E. Olive", "text": " That's correct.   And, you know, all that happens when you do an analysis of a reasoned decision, if you find it to be unreasonable, you get de novo review.   You don't get relief, you get de novo review, and you may lose under de novo review. I mean, what the AEDPA has accomplished is removing from federal judges the power to unilaterally, by exercising de novo review and not paying any attention necessarily to what the state court ruling was, violate comity and federalism. What the AEDPA did was say: No, you have to look at what the state court did and give it credit where credit's due.   And to apply Richter in states where there is a state seeking credit for its reasonable decision, to just ignore it creates -- creates sort of two polar opposites. Before the AEDPA, federal courts could pay no attention to what a state court did and grant relief.   And the state's rule now is federal courts should pay no attention to what state courts did and deny relief. And I think the AEDPA strikes the right balance.   It's between those two.   I respect what the state court has done.   If it's reasonable, then there's no de novo review.   If it's unreasonable, there is de novo review. And whether you win under that review one way or the other is a separate question. There's no circuit having any trouble with this other than the lower court.   This Court doesn't have any trouble with it when it looks through decisions and looks at the facts in the lower court. And I think the rule of all the circuits, other than the Eleventh, ought to be the rule for everyone.   If I could reserve my time? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Ms. Warren. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah Hawkins Warren", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A federal habeas court must apply 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)'s standard to the last state court merits decision whether that decision is summary and whether or not that decision is preceded by a lower state court's opinion. Put another way, federal habeas courts conducting a 2254(d) inquiry are not required to look-through a later summary state court merits decision to review only the specific reasoning of a lower state court opinion. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Ms. Warren, can I just ask a question about the breadth of your position? It's a little bit confusing to me from the briefs. You spent a lot of time talking about the word \"decision\" and how habeas review is only available for decisions, not for opinions. So does your argument go that even when the -- a state court, the higher state court has issued a reasoned decision, that even there the habeas court is not limited to that decision but can and should decide whether there are other grounds? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah Hawkins Warren", "text": " Justice Kagan, our position is that 2254(d) always applies to the decision, but when that last state court adjudication on the merits is reasoned, there is a textual basis in 2254(d) for the federal habeas court to look at those reasons to help assess whether the decision itself is contrary to or involved in unreasonable application of this Court's precedents. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I'm not sure I understand the question.   But suppose you said that the reasoned decision is -- is not -- is just completely wrong. Could you substitute, you know, so I think the way I've understood that that goes is that's completely wrong, so now we don't -- we don't give deference to it, right? It's taken itself out of AEDPA because it's completely wrong. Are you saying, no, there's a second step where you have to say, well, if I were the judge, I could have written a better decision that would receive AEDPA deference?

But on the practical side of things, and as the Eleventh Circuit explained below, I think in practice the federal habeas court when assessing the Georgia Supreme Court summary denial on the merits will first look to the lower court to see if the lower court's reasoned opinion offers any reasonable basis. And so, in many cases, the process would be very similar.

As to your point about respect for state courts, Georgia has a two-tiered habeas system.   There are two courts that will always pass on a habeas claim that is properly exhausted, first in the lower state court, where a reasoned opinion will ensue, and then the Georgia Supreme Court, which will analyze the application for CPC.

It says nothing, I think. When you have us saying ours should not be treated that way, of course, we don't want it as a precedent binding every court in the nation.   When a federal appeals court says our summary affirmance does not mean that we agree, of course, they don't want it to be binding throughout the circuit.
