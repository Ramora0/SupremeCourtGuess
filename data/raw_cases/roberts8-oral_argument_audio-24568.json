[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 16-1027, Collins versus Virginia. Mr. Fitzgerald. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The warrant requirement for the home and curtilage cannot be overthrown by the automobile exception. Under the Commonwealth's argument, on probable cause alone, an officer may search a vehicle anywhere that he finds it and may go anywhere that he needs to in order to access that vehicle. That rule cannot survive foundational Fourth Amendment principles.   Searches of the home and curtilage without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable, as this Court has often recognized. So the rule we ask this Court to adopt is that the automobile exception does not apply to a vehicle found in the curtilage of the home. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Suppose the -- the police have probable cause to believe that the vehicle is stolen and they even get a warrant to inspect the vehicle.   But the vehicle is parked in this port. Do they need -- do they need a warrant to go get the car for which they have a warrant? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, Your Honor, the -- the warrant would specify the place to be searched for the car.   And so, commonly, a warrant would say, for instance, the dwelling and curtilage to look for this motorcycle.   So the warrant that authorizes the search of the motorcycle would, by its terms, authorize the intrusion into the curtilage to look for -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But what if it didn't? So they have a warrant here, let's say, to search for -- they have probable cause to search this thing covered by a -- a tarp.   They have a warrant to search this motorcycle because it's been involved in criminal activity.   They want to get the vehicle identification number from it.   And they see it.   Let's say it's parked two feet from the curb.   But arguably -- or it's parked where it is here, maybe in the curtilage, maybe not in the curtilage. The -- that warrant would be insufficient? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, Your Honor, the Fourth Amendment, by its terms, requires a warrant to specify the place to be searched. So if they've seen the motorcycle in that spot and they get a warrant, the warrant would say this house on Dellmead Avenue, may have included the picture, and it would, by its terms, authorize the access to that. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And this is my question about your argument based on the curtilage.   We -- we ask whether a search within or outside the curtilage in order to determine whether the Fourth Amendment applies at all. But that's not really the question here because there is probable cause, and there is the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement.   So the issue is not whether there was a search.   Yes, there was a search.   And, yes, you know, if it -- if it was the curtilage, then there was -- there -- there was an intrusion on the protected area. But the warrant -- the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement, I take it, is based on two things.   One is the -- the risk that the vehicle is going to be moved during the time when the warrant is sought and, second, is a consideration on the other side of the risk that if there's not a warrant, the police will be wrong about probable cause and the degree of intrusion on property, on legitimate property interests that occur in that situation. It's a balancing.   It's not a consideration of whether it's on the curtilage or not.   And it's hard to see why the balance is any different here than it would be if this motorcycle had been parked on the street.   The -- the risk that it will be moved seems to be almost exactly the same.   And what -- what is the additional invasion of privacy? The invasion of privacy that's involved in walking a few feet up a driveway, and the home is not even Mr. Byrd's home.   Why does the balance come out different here? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, Your Honor, so here's -- here's the way that I think about that: If you're looking at the terms that support the automobile exception, you have ready mobility and you have the lessened expectation of privacy. But the curtilage and the home are essentially more important concerns than that. So, for instance, if I had a fistful of cocaine and I'm out in public, cocaine is extremely readily mobile.   There's nothing that is easier to dispose of than a fistful of cocaine.   If I've got a sink, it can be gone in seconds.   So it's extremely readily mobile.   Nor in the cocaine itself is there any expectation of privacy.   It's illegal to possess it already. But if I'm standing in, say, my living room or in my garage with a fistful of cocaine, the Court would require a warrant for the police to come to that address and look for that and get me.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah -- no, I think the privacy interests would be quite different if this was in the house or if it was in the garage, but this is not in either of those places.   It's in a spot that's visible from the street, right? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " It's visible from the street from directly at the end of the driveway, yes, Your Honor.   It -- it is obscured from any distance in either direction by the brick walls that surround where this motorcycle was on three sides, one side being the house. So the motorcycle here is five feet from the side of the house.   And -- and to the extent that curtilage is at issue, curtilage has been waived by the Commonwealth by not arguing it below.   And this is a clear case for curtilage, given the distance from the house. So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How much does your argument depend on us viewing this as two things: One, a trespass on private property, the curtilage, and then a search within that private space? Is your argument hinged on that distinction? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, I think we make that distinction because it's important just to make sense of the Fourth Amendment to think about it step-by-step.   And there are two searches here. The first is the intrusion into the curtilage under Jardines, which is clearly a search outside of any implied license, and the second is the removal of the cover from the motorcycle, which is similar to opening a container to find a vehicle inside or perhaps opening the door to a car or removing a cover from a car. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So if this motorcycle were parked on the street and it was covered by a tarp, you would say that the motor vehicle exception doesn't apply because it's covered by a tarp? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " No, Your Honor.   If it were parked on the street, then the automobile exception would apply. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So what's the relevance of the tarp? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " The relevance of the tarp is essentially that there is a -- there is some expectation of privacy in a tarp, particularly placed within the curtilage of the home.   So the location of the motorcycle is very important here. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what difference does it make that the tarp was there? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " The tarp perhaps makes it particularly clear that the officer was undergoing a search, not just, say, walking where he could have said, oh, this is almost on the way -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, let's change the hypothetical.   Is there still a violation under your theory of law if the motorcycle was in plain view in the curtilage and he just walked on to the curtilage and what -- I don't know where the VIN is on the motorcycle, by the way.   I don't -- you know, in a car, it's within the car, not outside the car, so you -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- have to open the car door.   But let's assume that you have to move something on the motorcycle.   I don't know.   Do you? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " I don't think you would have to move something on the motorcycle. And so -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Let's just assume that.   No -- no top on it. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " So if there -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Does your argument still stand? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   So if the motorcycle is where the motorcycle is in this case but there is no cover on it, there is a Fourth Amendment violation, and that is -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, why? Because, I mean, suppose the policeman is standing on the sidewalk.   He -- the window of the house is quite close, and there inside he sees a huge pile of cocaine.   Okay? I thought, but perhaps I've got it mixed up, I thought that seeing something that is an illegal substance that can be easily disposed of in about three seconds would, in fact, justify, create an exigent circumstance under which the policeman could enter? Am I wrong about that? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Close, Your Honor. So if -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What is the law there? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " If an officer standing on the sidewalk looks into the window of a house and sees a pile of drugs through the window -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " -- that creates probable cause that would permit the officer to get a warrant to go into the house. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, so he goes, gets a warrant, and they throw it all down the sink -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, this -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- and, of course, there is nothing by the time he comes back.   I mean, I thought that was an example of an exigent circumstance -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " If -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- but you know the area of this law better than I do, I -- I guess, and that isn't so. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " So it's not impossible that there would be an exigent circumstance there. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, no, I've given you the facts.   The facts are there's a big pile of cocaine right there and there's somebody wandering around inside. And -- and can't he -- I don't know, what is an exigent circumstance if it isn't that? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " It's -- it's particularly important to that hypothetical that there's someone wandering around inside -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   Fine.   Fine. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " -- because the introduction of the person is important -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " He has reason to think there's somebody in the house. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Right.   So it's certainly possible that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Or no -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " -- an exigency could be created, if there's a person who's wandering -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   So that -- yeah, if that's an exigent circumstance, and you happen to see -- now changing the situation -- you happen to see a motorcycle which is a rather unusual shape and happens to look identically like the one that you know was just stolen, you can't go and -- go look at it? You have to get a warrant? Of course, they drive away in the meantime, but, nonetheless, you -- you're there by yourself, no other policemen. It's in the window, okay, just like the cocaine, or it's in the driveway.   Why can't you? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " So just to be clear, in this case, the Supreme Court of Virginia steered away from exigency and said, no, we're not going -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I know that.   That's why I thought the tarp made a difference.   And that's why I thought this was a case about a tarp, oddly enough, and not a case about whether you have an exigent circumstance. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " It -- it is not a case about exigent circumstance. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But you just told me I'm wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " This is not an exigency case.   And the Supreme Court of Virginia specifically said that. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, no, I know that. What I'm trying to get at is I suddenly thought: I don't understand this case because you said the circumstance is the same without a tarp.   That's what confused me. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " So the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's why I asked the question. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " So the officer testified that when he arrived at the property, there was no one home.   And the exigency, the relevant exigency, were there one here, would be imminent destruction of evidence. And he testified that no one was there.   The motorcycle is under a tarp.   He has a picture or a cover -- he has a picture of the motorcycle in exactly the same place from Facebook, which he knows -- which he must know was taken at least a few hours earlier because he's been with the person who he believes owns the motorcycle in the meantime. So there's no obvious exigency here so much -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Fitzgerald -- I'm sorry, did you -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " There -- there's no obvious exigency here and that would be an issue for remand in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Can I go back to the exchange that you had with Justice Alito? When you gave your hypothetical about the drugs and he said, well, that would be different, it would be -- it's very different in a home, but here you have the motorcycle parked out in the open, on the driveway in this enclosure, where you can see it from the street. And I guess this is the question I want to ask you.   If -- if there is that difference, like in a home you better have a warrant.   But here it's out on the street but in the curtilage, in the curtilage, and that's established. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You know, it's not -- it's not disputed here.   How far are we committed by Jardines to treat the curtilage exactly as we would the home? That seems to me to be important given the, I think, the -- the things that you and Justice Alito agreed on. So how far do we say: Look, what Jardines said or what we've said in other cases is we have to treat the curtilage exactly as we would the home, even though you can actually see the motorcycle on the curtilage. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   So, in Jardines, the Court said \"the curtilage is protected as part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes.\" And -- and even though the Court in Jardines -- and at the time, the Court was quoting Oliver, the 1984 case that recognized open fields and said the same thing. And the idea that curtilage is protected as part of the home itself is -- is important, and I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Isn't it a problem -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But the -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- whose -- whose curtilage it is? Here we're told that there was a close relationship between the defendant and the homeowner.   But suppose there weren't that close relationship.   Suppose it was a brand new girlfriend and he never stayed overnight, he was hopeful, but he hadn't. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And it's the same -- parked the same way. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " So -- so you may, Your Honor, be -- it sounds like you are describing a difficult case of Fourth Amendment standing or right to object.   This Court has very clearly said in Minnesota versus Olson that the overnight guest has the right to object.   And that's the status in this case at minimum.   I mean, really it's his family.   It's the mother of his child, his child who lives there and she is the lessee.   He spends several nights a week there. On the other end of the spectrum, Minnesota versus Carter, being in a place for a couple of hours just to do business would not create a right to object.   So to the extent that connection to the property -- connection to the curtilage would be treated the same way as connection to the house. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Did -- coming back to Justice -- to the -- to the question, did we say in Jardines that the curtilage is to be treated the same as the house for all Fourth Amendment purposes? I thought the issue in Jardines was whether -- was whether officers who did not have probable cause were permitted to walk up to the front of the house, at which point they acquired probable cause. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, yes, Your Honor.   So Jardines identified a search and it identified a search of the home based on actions taken exclusively in the curtilage of the home.   And it -- the majority essentially said, as I read it, that the officers acted beyond the scope of the implied license when they brought a drug dog and they spent a few minutes in the curtilage sniffing around. That's not what there would be an implied license to do, which essentially is just a knock and talk. And so it's a search of the curtilage. And the Court stopped there, this Court stopped there, but, of course, it was affirming the Florida Supreme Court, which had thrown out the search for lack of a warrant based on the protection of the curtilage. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, we permit the police to seize items in plain view in a home.   They get a search warrant for the home. They see an item that they have probable cause to believe is incriminating evidence.   They can seize it. Justice Breyer said exigent circumstances permit the police to seize items. I think the assumption -- or not the assumption -- the premise of all of those cases is that the police are there legitimately.   If you have a warrant, you are permitted to be there. In Jardines, you could -- couldn't seize the incriminating evidence wafting from the house because you didn't have a right to be in the curtilage. And so isn't there a difference when you are in the street, as these police officers were, they have a right to be on the street, they have a right to look at whatever is visible, and they could see the motorcycle from there? So is this a plain view case? Is this a exigent circumstance case? I -- that's why I thought that Justice Breyer was asking whether the search of the tarp was part of this because was this in plain view, in essence? As -- as I understood it, they weren't sure it was the same motorcycle. They thought the wheel was the same, but I'm not sure why they -- they needed that if they knew the motorcycle was stolen, or did they not know yet that it was stolen? I don't remember now. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " The -- the record is unclear.   And we would not -- we -- we don't believe that the officer thought the motorcycle was stolen.   He was looking for the motorcycle that he had -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But how do you -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " -- but -- but it's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- address the way I'm looking at this, which is -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " It's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- the police are standing there, they see something and have probable cause to believe that it's incriminating evidence.   How is that different than being inside the home with a warrant? And -- and, again, does -- I'm not sure I see the difference, although the tarp is a difference because they are lifting -- they're searching something else besides the motorcycle. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " So, Your Honor, this is not a plain view case, because in Horton versus California, the Court said, in order for plain view to apply to allow the seizure of the thing, the officer must have a right of access to the thing itself. So there's no right of access. There's no implied license to go into the curtilage to look for evidence that you have seen.   And so seeing the motorcycle from the street in this case is just like seeing the motorcycle or seeing drugs through the window of a house. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Do you dispute the fact that they had probable cause to believe that the thing that they saw covered by the tarp was the motorcycle they were looking for? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " We do not dispute that. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " And so, ultimately, here this is a fairly straightforward case, I think.   There -- the motorcycle is five feet -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But you -- you don't dispute -- in other words, you -- in your view, you agree that the policeman standing on the sidewalk knows that that item covered by -- or at least has probable cause to it -- covered by the tarp is the possibly stolen motorcycle? You agree with that? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " He -- he has probable cause to believe that is the motorcycle that eluded him in traffic, that he was looking for. Of course, there could be other things under the tarp as well as the motorcycle. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So he didn't really have to lift the tarp at all? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, he wanted to lift the tarp to be sure. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So that's his decision; he didn't have to.   I mean, in -- in your view, he could have just grabbed the whole thing, tarp and all, if he'd had access? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, he didn't have access.   And I think it would be -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, I know that, but I'm saying if he'd had access to it.   If they'd said please come to my curtilage.   All right? (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now, if that had given him access, he could have just grabbed the whole thing, tarp and all.   Is your view -- I'm just saying do you agree -- you -- I thought from what you just said -- I -- I was surprised, but I thought that now you do agree that that is the case.   He could just grab the whole thing. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Do you agree with that or don't you agree with that? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " No, Your Honor.   So he is -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You don't agree with that? Okay.   Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " He is investigating the -- the crime of eluding him in traffic. Ultimately, that is a crime committed by the driver. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Which is different from a stolen vehicle.   I think we've gotten a little confused about that.   The police were looking for him because he eluded them by speeding away. The evidence of the theft comes when they see the -- the number after they lift the tarp. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   And now, there is some disagreement in the record about that, but the officer testified he went to the house solely to look for the motorcycle that had eluded him.   He was asked was the motorcycle -- did you think the motorcycle was contraband? And he said no.   So he was looking into the eluding, and when he ran the VIN number, he found that it was stolen. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Ahh, so -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- he didn't know this was stolen property yet? The VIN number gave -- this is like Jardines.   The VIN number gave him that information? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " That is what he stated, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No, it's not like Jardines -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Fitzgerald", "text": " Well, you couldn't -- you couldn't see the color scheme, but you could see the -- the basis for the probable cause is he has the Facebook picture that shows -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Yeah.   Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " -- the motorcycle not under a tarp.

He said I'm just going to go knock and talk.   And it's right there.   Would he have -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

In other words, you have a license to go to the door and knock, but you can't look at anything in the way.   You -- you sort of have to block it off. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew A. Fitzgerald", "text": " No, you have -- you have the right to use your eyes, but you don't have the right to go beyond what a reasonably respectful person approaching the door would do.   And stopping to examine or seize a motorcycle would be outside of that implied license. Now, of course, here the motorcycle is not even on the path to the front door.   He's not going to the front door.   He testified he was not knocking and talking.   He walked up solely to take the cover off to see if this was the motorcycle that he had probable cause to think that it was. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

So while it might be true for determining the reasonable expectations of privacy, it's not binding on -- on courts to say what's reasonable and what's not, based on whether it's the curtilage or the home.

Now, if all those things are true hypothetically, it's as if, though it's the curtilage, he saw in the middle of the driveway a box, and he thought inside that box there might be a motorcycle or drugs or something. And can he go up without a warrant and without there being exigent circumstances to open the box to look to see if inside there are drugs or a motorcycle? I thought that was this case.

My understanding is that there was a virtual certainty here that this was the same motorcycle under the tarp.   So there was not any uncertainty about what was under the box, as it were. The Court, to the second part, the Court has also treated other closed containers differently than vehicles.   In the Ross case, in Acevedo, they have said containers are different than automobiles because of the -- the movability of them is just far greater than the movability of other items. And there was a debate, there were some predecessors of yours on the Court who wanted to suggest that closed containers should be treated the same.   There were a couple justices in Coolidge who thought that was the case.   They ended up in the dissent in Ross and -- and certainly in -- in the minority in Acevedo.

The police can break into anything, go anywhere where they see the car, whether they're at that place legitimately or not. "}, {"speaker": "Trevor S. Cox", "text": " Yes.

We know that they have indoor plumbing. And so they can be readily destroyed too.   What's the difference between the destruction of drugs and papers in a home and a car in -- in the garage?

That was never the basis.   It was: You can search something that is on the open seas or in a -- in a harbor or on the streets, not that you can go into a home to find one.

For what purposes would you say that the curtilage is not the house? "}, {"speaker": "Trevor S.

And you -- you seem to be treating that the same as the situation when you have the motorcycle or an automobile, but I thought part of your argument was that the automobiles were inherently different because somebody could just jump on the motorcycle and ride away, while they wouldn't have the same mobility issues with respect to the box, the orange boxes.

But once you get beyond that, it is a search of the home, the ultimate Fourth Amendment question is always: Is it a reasonable search? And that's where we are here.   Is it reasonable? It's a balancing of interests.   That's what reasonableness meant in -- at the end of the 18th century; it's what it means today. And so you have to grapple with the real privacy interests that are involved in the case versus the other considerations; namely, the mobility of the automobile.

And -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You say if there's probable cause to get a warrant, then you don't need a warrant, and that's the automobile exception.

"}, {"speaker": "Trevor S. Cox", "text": " Well, I think under a plain view you'd have to have some -- some probable cause to believe that what you were say -- seeing was contraband or otherwise evidence of crime.

And he wouldn't -- he wouldn't be able to go up to the edge of the garage, assuming there was curtilage out there, and look in to see if it was in there.

Why isn't there the search of the motorcycle -- but there's really the search of the curtilage; it happened to be for the motorcycle, but it's the search of the curtilage, it's a different search entirely. "}, {"speaker": "Trevor S. Cox", "text": " We -- we look at it as one search because it's the object of the search that you are entitled to search, whether it's under a warrant or under a warrant exception. And you look at it by -- you know, it's not a separate search for each access point that you -- you go to. You wouldn't have gotten two warrants if you had gone to a magistrate.   You wouldn't get a warrant to search the motorcycle and then another warrant to actually cross the driveway to get there. So we see it as -- as one search for that reason.

"}, {"speaker": "Trevor S. Cox", "text": " I'm hesitant to speak beyond the automobile exception, but I think the automobile exception would give you that, that ability, unless there was some other rule that prevented you from doing it, such as a rule that the automobile exception doesn't apply in the house. And I'll say that, to go back to Justice Gorsuch's questions about the original understanding of this, all along the justifications for the vehicle exception have been based in the contradistinction between vehicles and houses or dwellings. At first it was the difference in mobility, but then later in -- in cases like Cady and Cardwell and Carney, they also speak of the reduced expectations of privacy that you have in a vehicle as compared to a fixed dwelling or a building. So, if the Court were to draw a line, it would -- it would certainly have some -- some healthy pedigree in the Court's previous decisions. Unless there are further questions, thank you.

Just a few points in rebuttal here. So the curtilage is protected as part of the home.   And if we look back, historically speaking, the automobile exception is born at a traffic stop in the 1920s. The automobile exception, as it is created, makes sense in that context.   But the automobile exception has grown.   It's become a categorical exception.   We no longer look for exigency on a case-by-case basis.   And now the automobile exception is literally knocking at the door of the house. And the question is whether to apply this exception, created based on exigent circumstances in 1925, to a search of the curtilage of a home. And now, on the state's argument, even -- even their backup argument, even what they give up, there easily could have been probable cause to think that this motorcycle was at this residence if it were around behind the house, if the driveway went just a little bit farther. And it should not be that searching for an automobile, or what might be in an automobile, would get police around a house like that, around to the back door, where there might be, I mean, in this case, the side door, a sliding door, where if you're standing where this motorcycle is, you can see directly into the side door of the house and you can see this just a little bit at the petition appendix page 112. The curtilage is an area that is intimately linked to the home.   This Court said in Jardines, as well as in Ciraolo, it's intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically, and it's where expectations of privacy are most heightened. We submit that the clear, bright-line rule for officers, which is that when they go to a known address to look for contraband, even readily-mobile contraband, they bring a warrant with them, should apply when they're going to a known address to look for a vehicle as well. And if there are no further questions, respectfully I ask this Court to reverse. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
