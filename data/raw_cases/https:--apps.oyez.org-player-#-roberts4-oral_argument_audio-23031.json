[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-661, American Needle v. The National Football League.   Mr. Nager. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that an agreement of the 32 teams of the National Football League was immune from any scrutiny under Section 1 of the Sherman Act on the ground that the agreement allegedly fails the plurality of actor requirement of this Court's jurisprudence.   The 32 teams of the National Football League are separately owned and controlled profit-making enterprises.   Under this Court's decision in NCAA, as well as the Court's more general joint venture jurisprudence, those clubs are entities whose distinct agreements are, indeed, subject to Section 1 scrutiny.   The fact of the matter is there is a longstanding consensus, judicial and legislative, that agreements among sports teams about whether and how they will participate in the marketplace is subject to scrutiny under the Sherman Act, Section 1.   The Court's decision in NCAA is most directly on point.   In that case, the Court held that a policy of the NCAA that restricted the ability of member institutions of the NCAA to sell TV rights violated Section 1.   Just as with the NFL, the decisions of the NCAA were ultimately controlled by the vote of its members, and for that reason, the Court held that the NCAA policy was a horizontal restraint. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But there was no joint venture with respect to the television rights, meaning there was no separate activity, other than the televising of the shows at issue.   Here, the Solicitor General is saying there is a joint venture, and it has to do with the licensing of trademarks, with their quality control, et cetera.   Isn't that a substantial difference? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " No, I don't -- I don't think so, because what we are asking about here is -- is the question of whether or not the agreement of the teams involves a plurality of actors.   And just as in NCAA, the members' institutions -- because they control the operation of the NCAA and the policy that it was promulgating, there was a plurality of actors.   So, too, here, the 32 teams of The National Football League have entered into an agreement and control the use, collectively, of the trademarks and logos of the individual teams.   And for that reason, there is concerted activity that is involved.   Justice Sotomayor, the point that you raise might be of -- a point of difference that the NFL could argue in the context of an ancillary restraint analysis and the context of a rule of reason analysis, but it is not a point of distinction that they can argue properly in the context of the concerted conduct inquiry.   The NCAA case simply applies the consistent teachings of this Court in cases like Sealy, BMI, and Copperweld, that separately owned and controlled entities entering into agreements, those agreements constitute concerted conduct subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Did that cover everything that the NFLA does?   Because everything is subject to agreement, it's all concerted action, so is everything under the Sherman Act, and then it goes to rule of reason analysis?   Or are there some things that escape, entirely, antitrust analysis? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Certainly everything in the -- that is challenged in this case, because this involves a restriction on the activities of the venturers themselves.   But more generally, I would -- I would answer your question, Justice Ginsburg, to say that yes, that everything that these 32 separately owned and controlled teams joined together to do by -- in concert, by agreement, by consent, is a contract. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Changes in the -- in the rule apply?   They make a change to make it -- give the passer more protection, but there's -- this really hurts certain teams, which mostly run, and so -- rule of reason? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Yes, it is concerted activity.   I don't think it would be a plausible rule of reason claim. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, how -- you know the litigation system.   How do we know? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Well, I think we know the following, Justice Kennedy: That under this Court's rule of reason's jurisprudence, a plaintiff has to be able to plead an identifiable anticompetitive effect in a market in which the defendant plausibly has market power, and the -- the plaintiff also has to be one who can-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, my -- my hypothetical: Two or three teams which aren't particularly popular in the league are hurt by the rule change.   And notice -- notice, the owners sit around the room, they are liable for a conspiracy.   I mean, this is serious stuff.   Triple damages.   I don't -- and my question, really, was the same as Justice Ginsburg.   Can you give us a zone where we are sure a rule of reason inquiry will be -- would be inappropriate?   We can take care of it on summary judgment.   Because if you don't have some sort of Section 1 carveout for joint action, then -- then everything is under the rule of reason. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --Well, Justice Kennedy, let me answer your question in two parts.   First of all, to the extent that the Court is looking for a zone, the concerted conduct doctrine is the wrong place to do it, because remember, if something is deemed not to be concerted conduct, it is a per -- then it's per se, not subject to section 1 and per se legal.   And I think for the Court's jurisprudence over the last 30 years, the Court has been trying to get out of per se rules and have a more focused inquiry into what the anticompetitive effects and procompetitive effects of a particular restraint are.   The concerted conduct doctrine would be a very blunt tool to use for that purpose.   Now, that is not to say -- and I appreciate your question -- in the NCAA case itself, where conditions of competition and the like were raised, Justice Stevens' opinion for the Court says that in contrast to the TV restraint, these other types of rules and regulations of the sports league are presumptively competitive, procompetitive, presumptively favorable to consumers, because they are integral and bound up with the creation of the football venture itself. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, let me give you another example that you mention in your brief.   The NFL teams agree among themselves regarding scheduling: They will play 16 games a year and they will have a playoff schedule and they won't play any other games.   Now, would that be a clear case under the rule of reason?   You mention and some of your amici mention that, for example, the English football leagues operate very differently. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Justice Alito, if I -- I may not have gotten all of your question, but let me answer it in two parts.   The antitrust laws do not require joint ventures to maximize output.   They don't require joint ventures to maximize competition.   They simply prohibit people entering into contracts from unreasonably restraining trade.   So a mere agreement among the team owners that they would have a 14-game schedule rather than a 16-game schedule is not a prima facie showing of an anticompetitive impact, because all it's showing us is what the joint venturers have done with their own output.   They have -- you haven't alleged a market-wide reduction in output.   Now, if by your question you were saying in addition-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, what if one of the team wants -- one of the teams wants to play additional games-- "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " --against a rival team where they will get more money? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --What I -- what I was going to jump right to is: If in addition to changing the league schedule, the team owners in concert agreed to prohibit the teams of the National Football League from -- from playing any other games -- doing an exhibition game in Japan, the Redskins and the Giants playing another game -- that might show a market-wide reduction in output.   And the Court's decision in NCAA says very specifically that the most important condition of ensuring the competitiveness of joint ventures is ensuring the freedom of the individual venturers to produce output, increase output.   Now, that doesn't mean that a league rule of that type would be unlawful.   All I'm trying to suggest is if in addition to changing the schedule of games for the league, they also imposed a restriction on the individual venturers from producing additional games on their own, we might have something that looked more like a plausible rule of restraint-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They couldn't -- they couldn't stop that team from joining another league?   Let's assume -- and I -- you know, I don't know enough about football, but let's assume there are two leagues playing.   One of them plays on Saturday and the other plays on Sunday.   You are suggesting that the joint venture couldn't stop their members from joining that other league?   What's the purpose of being in a venture if -- if you are free to reject it and go to somewhere else? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --What I'm saying is, first of all, it would plainly be concerted activity on the part of the team owners because they would have entered into a horizontal restraint on the activity of the venturers.   Whether or not that horizontal restraint violated the antitrust laws, one would have to go through the following analysis, Justice Sotomayor: First, we would ask whether that restriction is an ancillary -- was an ancillary restraint.   And an ancillary restraint, starting with Judge Taft, later Chief Justice Taft's, opinion in the Addison Pipe case, is: Is that restraint reasonably necessary to achieve the efficiency-enhancing purposes of the joint venture and is it no broader than necessary?   And if it is, then we would analyze that restraint by reference to its own procompetitive benefits and anticompetitive effects; we would analyze it by reference to the benefits of the joint venture as a whole. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, it seems to me -- your last few answers seem to me to beg the question.   You start out by saying: Well, obviously it's a horizontal agreement among the teams, and then you explain how you are going to analyze it.   I thought that was the very question before us: Whether these sorts of rules and regulations are horizontal agreements between the teams or whether they are part of a particular -- a single entities' articulation of rules. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly right, and the real-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " That you have been begging the question?   Is that -- it's that part?   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --Well, let me try to address Justice Sotomayor's subsequent question in the context of the way you are posing the question, Mr. Chief Justice.   The reason it's a horizontal restraint is because these -- under the Court's doctrine, consistent teachings, whether it be Sealy, BMI, Copperweld, these teams are separately owned.   They are separate decision-makers joining together, and they are making a decision about how they are going to jointly produce something or not produce something.   And that's what makes it concerted activity under this Court's consistent teachings.   The distinction between unilateral activity under section 1 and concerted activity under section 1 has consistently been the distinction between ownership integration of assets and contract integration of assets. "}, {"speaker": "John Paul Stevens", "text": " Can I interrupt with this question?   Is it not part of your burden not only to argue there are multiple actors, but also that their agreement has an adverse effect on competition? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " It -- absolutely, as the plaintiff in the case, Justice Stevens, that -- we do.   That is not the ground of decision on the court below. "}, {"speaker": "John Paul Stevens", "text": " I understand it isn't, but it is part of your burden to say this is not a procompetitive agreement. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Absolutely.   And I'm not-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But not -- not here. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --In the -- I'm sorry, Justice? "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Not here. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " I -- I don't have to argue -- I mean, I don't think I have to argue in this Court.   I just have to answer your questions, but-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " If -- if we find for you and it goes back, then you would -- you would bear that burden. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --That's correct.   And in fact, in this case, Justice Stevens, I would point out that the NFL initially moved to dismiss the -- the rule of reason count on the ground that it didn't state a cognizable, plausible rule of reason, and the district court judge denied that motion.   He found the complaint alleged a market in which he could not say as a matter of law that the NFL defendants did not have market power, and he recognized that the -- that the teams had agreed together to prohibit competition in an aspect of their licensing activity and in an aspect of their merchandising activity. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " How does it work? "}, {"speaker": "John Paul Stevens", "text": " But what if he -- what if he further concluded that the agreement had the overall effect of stimulating additional -- it was procompetitive in that it would equalize the economic strength of the teams, and therefore made them all better competitors on the playing field?   Would that have been a defense? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " I'm sorry, Justice Stevens, I'm not quite sure.   But you are saying if in the response to a motion to dismiss he had -- he had held-- "}, {"speaker": "John Paul Stevens", "text": " Right.   He said: Sure, there is an agreement here, but the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the agreement has an adverse effect on competition.   And that the -- as I understand the facts, you've -- there is revenue sharing here, isn't there?   That they -- they all share in the product of the sales of the joint product? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --Well, let me explain what they've done, and I will then explain why it does have a -- identifiable anticompetitive effects, which certainly satisfy the pleading standards for a rule of reason claim.   What the teams did here was they got together and they agreed that they would not, themselves, individually license their trademarks or logos.   They agreed that they -- under -- the current market system included the issuance of market blanket licenses.   They would eliminate all but one of those blanket licenses from the market and they would give it in the exclusive control of Reebok, and they would limit the circumstances in which they competed against each other and with Reebok, and said-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But I thought -- I thought -- as I read your complaint, almost every word of it had to do with pro -- per se violations.   So I forget those here, right? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --The per se violation was dismissed and-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You forget -- just yes or no.   I forget it?   Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --is not before the Court. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now, I've suddenly heard you talk -- the only thing left I could see was where you say by their agreement to grant an exclusive license to Reebok, they unreasonably restrained trade in the markets.

I'm asking a question.   And I just heard you say that you want, for example, were it -- you want the Patriots to sell T-shirts in competition with the Saints, or whoever.   The Red Sox.   All right.   You see the point?   The Red Sox -- I know baseball better.   You want the Red Sox to compete in selling T-shirts with the Yankees; is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D.

You listed three or four, and one of them is you want, in effect -- I'm joking about it, but it's true -- you are arguing that the Yankees should compete with the Red Sox in selling shirts.   Another thing you are complaining about, which is the one I understand less, is that these teams got together and they agreed that they would just have one person sell all this stuff together.   And what you think is that they individually should have decided whether to choose that one person, or maybe to choose two people, or three; is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D.

The Saturday/Sunday scheduling issue, it seems to me, pretty clearly on its face does limit competition.   You -- you have one day instead of two days.   Then Justice Stevens said: Suppose it makes them better players because they are rested and so they can perform better.   I take it that was the purpose of the question.   And I -- I still don't get any answers.   I don't know where we are with this. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --The answer to-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And -- and it's a difficult area, but I would like -- and -- but I would like some guidance. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --Well, the guidance I would give you, Justice Kennedy, is that as Justice Scalia says, the only question before the Court is whether or not these agreements constitute concerted activity.   They plainly do, because they are agreements between separately owned and controlled competing businesses. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Nager, I think you answered my question originally: Yes, everything.   Because they are separate entities, they agree on everything.   There is agreement in every case, so there was nothing you would take outside, and you would put everything under the rule of reason analysis. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " That -- that is correct.   But that doesn't mean that the rule of reason is some unstructured, indeterminate-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " One -- one concern in the litigation is, you know, if it doesn't come under the Sherman Act at all, they go home after the case is dismissed on the -- on the pleadings.   But once you say no, it's got to be a rule of reason analysis, then you have discovery, which can be costly.   And I thought that that was a feature of this case, that the -- that the plaintiff wanted more discovery, and the court said: You've had enough. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --Well, no.   The -- the judge only allowed discovery on the single entity issue.   He did not allow discovery on -- on the rule of reason question.   So there's been -- not been -- discovery on the substance of the case has not been conducted.   So in that regard, the question of how the case would be managed going forward is something that would be in the hands of the district court on remand from this Court and the court of appeals, after this erroneous conclusion that the agreements don't constitute concerted conduct is put to the test. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, could you articulate for me as succinctly as possible the extent to which your position departs from the position of the Solicitor General? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " The Solicitor General's position is correct insofar as it criticizes the Seventh Circuit's reasoning.   The test that the Solicitor General proposes is conceptually and doctrinally unsound, and it will create a lack of clarity where there presently exists clarity in the cases, and it will produce inefficiency and waste in the conduct of litigation that does not presently exist. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I would have thought it is just the transfer of the inefficiency and lack of clarity from the -- the first question to the rule of reason.   I mean, I'm not quite sure it -- you don't have the same problem.   It's just a question of where you want to rest the inefficiency and confusion. "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Well, I understand your point, Mr. Chief Justice: That to the extent that rule of reason inquiries are not as refined as they need to be, since the Solicitor General's concerted conduct inquiry includes rule of reason inquiries -- indeed, on its effective merger standard, it says it has to survive a rule of reason analysis or somehow be waived, or you would have to do it as part of the concerted conduct inquiry -- so that there is no doubt to the extent that -- that the rule of reason is a continuing project of this Court, we would be transferring some of that project into the concerted conduct inquiry.   With all respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that would be a healthy development in the law.   The courts actually understand the concerted conduct doctrine as it presently exists. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I -- I thought the purpose of their submission was to respond to some of the questions we've seen, like scheduling, like what the rules are going to be about -- about the game.   There are some things that it just seems odd to subject to a rule of reason analysis.   And you yourself have said: Well, that is going to be an easy case under the rule of reason.   Why doesn't it make sense to sort of carve those out at the outset, rather than at the end of the case? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " Well, I think the answer is, you should -- you should use English language and doctrine to address the issue that you are actually trying to address, rather than call it something else.   Right now we have an antitrust doctrine that says you've got to have concerted conduct and you have to have an unreasonable restraint of trade.   We have courts that understand how to apply this Court's cases on concerted conduct.   This Court is -- for understandable reasons, is sensitive to the fact that the rule of reason is not quite as well understood and is an evolutionary doctrine, perfectly well understood by me.   There are certain issues that this Court has said come up in a rule of reason analysis, and to quote the Court from Cal Dental,   \"can be dealt with in the twinkling of an eye. \"   that is, some claims, as the NCAA Court said, are not going to be serious rule of reason claims and can be dismissed on the pleadings.

Among the powers that is vested in the commissioner by the NFL -- by the NFL constitution is the power to incur expenses to carry on the ordinary business of the League, and this includes renting office space, hiring employees, and procuring supplies.   And if the commissioner, pursuant to that delegation of authority, decides from which company he's going to -- to acquire paper for the League's offices or decides what the weight scale for secretaries in the League offices should be, our view is that that's the conduct of a single entity.   It may be that the commissioner's power to do those things is ultimately derived from the consent of the individual teams within the League, but once that consent has been given, once that authority has been centralized, then the commissioner's decision about a paper supplier or wages for employees-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

Or just say: Look, it's a joint venture.   If Panagra creates a joint venture, of course they are going to buy things like office space and employees, so it's reasonable by definition.   We don't even look into it.   Those things that are close enough.

The logic of Petitioner's position suggests that that would be subject to Section 1 scrutiny.

The question was: How should the League, how should the venture members, best promote the venture product?   And the decision was made to use the licenses of their intellectual property as a promotional tool.   On that issue, the discovery and the record below was undisputed.   There is documentary evidence from the NFL Properties' articles of incorporation.   There is testimony from an NFL executive, Mr. Herzog.

The -- I can understand an argument, and we suggested as much in our brief below, that if the League engages in a practice of representing itself, going to the market -- the clubs go to market as independent entities.

Coaches are closer to production and promotion of the game than secretaries, but I -- you know, there may be some -- some gap there.

The case was decided on summary judgment, and so -- you know, this is not a situation where -- where there is the type of -- you know, the range of issues that needs to be -- you know, that needs to be resolved, of the kind that you described.

Levy", "text": " --If -- Your Honor, just as in Dagher -- in Dagher, the issue was how to price the product.   It's a fundamental decision that any venture has to make.   This is a decision -- the undisputed evidence shows that this is a decision about how to promote the product, and that is no different from pricing a product in terms of the -- you know, the operations of a venture.   You can't -- you can't hope to market a product, unless you have decided on how to promote it, and the antitrust laws in the Sherman Act encourage promotion.   They encourage -- Copperweld encourages business people to make the judgment about how best to produce and to promote their product and how best to compete in the marketplace.   They made, very clearly, that they don't want this judgments cabined or inhibited or chilled by -- by decisions by the Court or decisions by a jury.   But, here, Judge Moran did what we thought was -- the -- and we continue to think, is the most appropriate way to serve the interests of both the Sherman Act and the considerations that this Court has recognized in Twombly and other cases, and that is to provide an early opportunity for a determination of whether or not the venture -- the venture conduct, the venture decision that is at issue, is a venture decision of a single entity or whether it's a collective decision of the -- of the venture participants.   He allowed discovery limited to the single -- single entity issue.   The -- the -- there is no challenge to the scope of discovery here.   We have a complete record on this point that confirms and addresses the question that you presented, that the purpose of licensing here is to promote the product.   But even if it weren't -- even if it weren't, I would suggest that -- that -- that the -- the evidence shows that fans identify with the logos, and we are talking about the logos and the marks here, not because they have some sort of intrinsic value, not because they -- you know, derive -- they derive some value from their attractiveness or appeal, independently in the marketplace, they derive their value from their identification with an NFL club that competes on the football field.   And even -- even American Needle's president so confirmed in the declaration that he submitted in the case.   So we have here a record that makes this -- this judgment for the Court relatively straightforward.   It provides a straightforward opportunity for this -- this Court to confirm the principles established in -- established in Copperweld and to -- and to extend the principles that this Court noted in Dagher.

In the Salvino case, there were three years of discovery spent on rule of reason issues-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But it's a single purpose -- and I certainly sympathize with that argument.   But isn't the proposition of antitrust law that we have a reason for worrying about concerted activity?   We have a genuine concern as -- or Congress does -- about independent entities joining together and fixing prices.   And we permit them to do so, as Justice Breyer indicated, when the venture has a purpose that is independent than -- from the individual interest, but we say, when it doesn't, we have to ensure, under the rule of reason, that what they are doing is reasonable.   I'm -- I am very swayed by your arguments, but I can very much see a counterargument that promoting T-shirts is only to make money.   It doesn't really promote the game.   It promotes the making of money.   And once you fix prices for making money, that's a Sherman Act violation. "}, {"speaker": "Gregg H.

Now, you say that's ridiculous, and once you say that's ridiculous, you are now into the business of deciding whether this aspect of the undeniable legal joint venture to play baseball or football, whether this aspect is properly the subject of merger.   And once you are into that, you are into your $7 million, and I can't really think of anything that's going to help you there.   And the SG in its brief, you see on that key, 16 and 17, seem to me, simply reproduces in precisely somewhat different language, but precisely the argument you are now having, is this the kind of thing that should be merged?   We know by applying the rule of reason.   And second, if it is merged, is this particular aspect of it something where there could be competition, and there isn't much justification, that's their rule, too.   Again, we are back to the rule of reason.   So how do I save you the $7 million? "}, {"speaker": "Gregg H. Levy", "text": " --But, Your Honor, this case is the perfect example.   We were able to resolve this case on summary judgment without incurring the burden of rule of reason discovery, and your reference to the Patriots tractor store drives home a distinction that I think is worth leaving with the Court at this point.   This is not a situation, like the situation to which we referred in our brief, where John Deere and International Harvester get together and fix the prices of their logos for sale to cap manufacturers.   John Deere and International Harvester, for many years -- I mean, early on, they gave away the hats throughout the Midwest, to encourage farmers to buy their farm equipment.   They are independent sources of economic power. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, you -- you say that the -- that the trademarks have no value apart from the -- from the game.   I guess you could say the same thing for each individual franchise of each of the 32 clubs.   They are worthless, if NFL Football disappears.   So does that mean they -- that they -- they can agree to fix the price at which their -- their -- their franchises will be sold, by concerted agreement, because after all, they are worthless apart from the NFL?

In 1999 -- 1919, when Judge Covington and Mr. Burling went to joint forces, they formed a law firm eventually.   Ninety years later that venture decides on the prices, the rates that Mr. Ludwin and I will -- will decide for our -- will charge for our services.   Sometimes that venture, the firm decides that we won't do business with a particular client or that we will limit our business to a particular client in a particular industry.   Nobody suggests that that decision of the venture, a lawful venture, is subject to Section 1 scrutiny as a violation of the Sherman Act constitutes a concerted refusal to deal.   But if Mr. Ludwin and I leave the -- leave the firm and we set up solo practices and then decide on what our rates are going to be, or then decide on what our clients -- what clients we will serve and not serve, that is an agreement between independent competitors.   That's the fundamental difference.   That is a fundamentally different situation between -- compared to the situation of the firm setting our rates.   And it reflects the intersection of Copperweld and Dagher.   It shows how Dagher and Copperweld fit together hand in glove to demonstrate purposes that the NFL, for purposes of promoting its product, is a single entity. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

I'd just like to pick up on a question that Chief Justice Roberts asked me with a point that Justice Breyer made, which is that both the Solicitor General's position and the NFL's position are taking rule of reason concepts and trying to push them into the concerted conduct inquiry, which will have the effect, of course, of confusing courts that presently understand the inquiry.   That's Justice Breyer's point about terminology.   It also has substantive impact because of the way litigation gets conducted.   As Mr. Levy has said, this case was litigated below at of the district court judge's direction only on the concerted conduct question, not on the -- the rule of reason questions.   So, American Needle didn't have the opportunity to conduct discovery and make proof about anticompetitive effects and to try to rebut the arguments that the NFL was making about procompetitive justifications.   The NFL's argument is asking -- they are asking for a per se rule of legality for everything that the NFL does that is related to football.   That can't be-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What's the answer to the -- what's the answer to the hypothetical Mr. Levy ended with, the law firm? "}, {"speaker": "Glen D. Nager", "text": " --On the -- the partnership example.   Well, the partnership is -- is as follows:   As -- as to the extent that there is case law on the subject, as with all joint ventures, the case law treats law firm partnerships as joint ventures and subjects them to the rule of reason, and every commentator whether it be Judge Bork or anyone else, has said, but, of course, law firms don't have market power so they couldn't possibly have anticompetitive effects on the market, and the rule of reason claim trying to challenge the rates at which a law firm sets its partnership rates wouldn't pass -- survive a motion to dismiss.   With respect to his analogy to Dagher, the difference between the Dagher effects -- of course this Court didn't in Dagher didn't accept the argument that I made on behalf of Texaco and Shell that they should be treated as a single entity if, in fact, their formation was lawful.   This Court only ruled on the -- on the price fixing issue.   But the argument that was made in Dagher was if you had a wholly integrated joint venture, one in which there had been a complete pooling of relevant capital, a complete sharing of profits and losses and an enforceable non-compete agreement, in those circumstances the -- the owners of that joint venture were not like typical joint venturers, they, in fact, were like the share holders in a publicly held company, because their only interest at that point is in their investment.   They have no other economic interests that are affected by their ownership and control of that entity.   And at that point they could be treated as one.   In Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court has some residence of that in it, but it specifically says it is only addressing it in terms of the per se rule. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
