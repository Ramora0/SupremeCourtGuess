[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 22-23, Pugin versus Garland, and the consolidated case. Mr. Gannon. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1996, Congress made an offense relating to obstruction of justice an aggravated felony for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act.   At the time it did so, the phrase \"obstruction of justice\" was understood to include crimes that occurred when a proceeding or investigation was not currently pending. The wheels of justice can be obstructed even before they begin to move. Indeed, one of the best ways to obstruct an investigation or a proceeding is to ensure that it never starts in the first place. My friends on the other side say that only 14 states plus D.C. even punished obstruction of justice in 1996 and that Congress meant to limit obstruction of justice to a catch-all offense in the federal Criminal Code that includes a pending proceeding requirement. But, by 1996, Congress had added other obstruction-of-justice offenses without any such limitation, and it had expressly disavowed such a limit in 1982 when creating the principal federal witness and evidence tampering statute, 18 U.S.C. 1512. Also by 1996, case law, dictionaries, leading commentators, and the Model Penal Code had all recognized that the kinds of offenses at issue in these two cases -- accessory after the fact and witness tampering -- involved obstruction of justice even when the elements of the offense did not require there to be a pending investigation or proceeding at the time of the offense conduct. This Court should hold that the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding otherwise. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mr. Gannon, could you give us a straightforward definition of \"obstruction of justice\"? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We agree with the definitions on page 23 of our brief from legal dictionaries that obstruction of justice involves willfully interfering with the process of justice.   And the Board here said that the offenses at issue are the category that have an affirmative act that includes a specific intent to interfere with the process of justice and law. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So you give a wide range of -- of evidence.   You talk about Blackstone, as well as Chapter 73.   Do you think all of the crimes listed there are obstruction-of-justice crimes? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We think that they're obstruction-of-justice crimes if they have the specific intent to interfere with an investigation.   Now we don't think that the investigation has to have already come into existence.   It can be a future investigation. In a retaliation case, it can be a past investigation. But we think that it -- it does -- in -- in most circumstances, is going to require there to be a nexus -- in all circumstances, there'll need to be a nexus to a particular investigation or proceeding that could come about, but that comes through the specific intent to interfere with the process of justice and law.   It doesn't need to already be in -- in existence at the time the conduct occurs. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, one of the things that troubles me about both sides' position is the \"relating to\" language.   It seems to me that to the extent you have a broad definition of \"obstruction of justice,\" it becomes even broader when you say \"relating to.\" And, of course, on the other side, the narrow definition -- I don't know that it takes adequate account of that. So I understand the formulation in your brief, but could you flesh out a little bit more about how \"relating to\" works, particularly against your fairly broad definition of obstruction? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well, I think, ultimately, we agree that \"relating to\" does broaden beyond just what would be core obstruction of justice, but the Board here has recognized that the offenses that we're talking about are those that have the specific intent to interfere with proceedings of -- of law and justice. And so that, we think, is the -- ultimately the limiter here.   Even though it would need to relate to obstruction of justice, we think, to the extent that there is a specific intent to interfere, that's a sufficiently close nexus that you don't need to be concerned about sweeping in a lot of other offenses. And the Board in 1999 drew the line between accessory after the fact and misprision of felony in the federal Criminal Code, between Section 3 and Section 4.   It said accessory after the fact, a crime that looks almost exactly like Mr. Pugin's crime here under any law. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but, I mean, if you -- if you -- we're dealing with a criminal statute here, and if you didn't have the Board's construction, would your -- what would your answer? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " My answer would -- would be that obstruction of justice in the dictionary definitions still requires willfully interfering with the process of justice and law.   I think \"relating to\" does get us a little bit beyond that at the margins.   I'm not exactly sure what those offenses are going to be.   It does need to be categorical. And so we think that in this context, though, the Board, looking for that specific intent, should give the Court reassurance that we're not sweeping in a lot of other offenses. And to the extent that the other side is concerned about -- and some of the amici are concerned about defining offense conduct broadly, this case isn't about what actually violates any of the underlying offenses.   We take those as given. The question is just whether, as a category, as a family of offenses, obstruction-of-justice offenses need to have a pending proceeding.   And we think the answer to that is clearly not. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " When -- when you say that there needs to be some sort of nexus to a proceeding or an investigation, are you suggesting that there needs to be a kind of reasonable foreseeability in the way that I think that the Board has indicated previously? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well, we think -- we acknowledge that that effectively comes in, but it does, though, as part of the specific intent inquiry.   It can't be a stand-alone element.   If it were a stand-alone element, then, essentially, no state statute would come in because no state statute echoes the Arthur Andersen opinion that this Court issued in 2005 -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- to construe 1512. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " I think Justice Sotomayor -- I'll go after. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Gannon, let me start with, what other aggravated felony is defined merely by dictionary -- by the dictionary? Because that seems to be what you're doing.   Tell me what other identified aggravated felony do we approach that way. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well, you approach the sexual-abuse-of-a-minor offense in Esquivel-Quintana that way.   You used other sources, and we too are using the same sources that you used in Esquivel-Quintana -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But we -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- to say that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- we were just defining -- in that case, we were using the categorical approach and looking at common law elements and figuring out what they meant. Now, assuming that the -- I think the other side has a point that we have to find what the definition is of \"obstruction of justice\" or \"relating to obstruction of justice,\" all I can find is that in 1831, leading commentators, Blackstone and Kent, understood it to require a pending petition. In 19 -- in 1893, the Court in Pettibone held that obstruction of justice requires a pending petition. Congress reenacted the offense in 1948, explaining that it made no substantive change to the -- to the petition at the -- at the time of Pettibone. Then, in 1995, just one year before obstruction of justice was added to the INA list of aggravated felonies, the Court of -- the Court in Aguilar again required interference with a pending proceeding. Now you say some states in 1996 had expanded it not -- expanded the definition of \"obstruction of justice\" not to need a pending proceeding.   But the majority of them still defined it that way. I look at how Congress used it, and in all of the federal Criminal Code, the fray \"relating\" -- phrase \"relating to obstruction of justice\" appears in just one other place, RICO Section 1961, and it specifically refers to 1503. That same provision refers to Section 1512 as relating to tampering with a witness. So Congress itself is now saying we think of obstruction of justice as something different than the other provisions.   And if we read things the way you're saying, there's a lot that's superfluous in this statute. Why would Congress have made it necessary to point to perjury or to false statements or to other provisions that it did? I -- I'm a little bit confused.   I would think that we would go to what the common law understanding was at the time in 1996 -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- and in 1996, every use of \"relating to obstruction of justice\" required a pending proceeding. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- Justice Sotomayor, we do not disagree that 1503 is an obstruction-of-justice offense.   We disagree about the idea that that's the only obstruction-of-justice offense in federal criminal law, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, you're -- you're missing the point. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The point is what are the elements of an obstruction of justice, and if it required a pending proceeding -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Yes, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- how do we read it out? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Because we think that you have to look at more offenses than 1503 in order to determine -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But, when Congress did that -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " But the only instance -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- like in when it referred to 1512, it said relating to tampering with a witness, not relating to the obstruction of justice, as it did in RICO. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " The -- RICO is the only place where it does that, and the two parallel cross-references -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And then -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E.

Gannon", "text": " -- talking about -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- why bother with all the other definitions, perjury, all the other crimes? They all relate to obstruction of justice according to you with or without a proceeding. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I think the aggravated felony definition is replete with potential overlap.   Congress clearly wanted this definition to be broad.   It returned to it several times in the 1990s in order to make it broader, in order to reduce the punishment thresholds.   It reduced the punishment threshold here from five years to one year. And there are other things that clearly overlap in the aggravated felony definition.   Murder -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There are many states that make it a crime not to -- not to report a crime, even if the person hasn't aided or abetted or participated in any way in the crime or helped the criminal. Is that an obstruction-of-justice offense? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Only if it has the specific intent requirement to interfere with an investigation. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But it seems to me -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " And what we are saying is that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- you're reading that intent in -- into everything. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So is the BIA. You're saying that just because an investigation might follow, you're responsible. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We read that intent requirement by looking at the dictionary definitions, the commentators, the Model Penal Code, lots of other things that had happened in the law after Blackstone in 1831. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We take Pettibone and -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   Why don't you finish your answer to Justice Sotomayor, and then I have a question. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We -- we take Pettibone and this Court's decision in Aguilar in 1995 as saying that 1503 did have the pending proceeding requirement, but we think it's clear that Congress considered a larger range of offenses, including those that are in Chapter 73, as also being obstruction-of-justice offenses, and, indeed, Section 3, the accessory-after-the-fact provision, which federal courts of appeals since the late 1960s and early 1970s had repeatedly characterized as saying the gist of an accessory-after-the-fact offense under Section 3 is obstruction of justice.   We think that is part of the context against which Congress enacted this definition in 1996. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, looking at your reasonable foreseeability point, exactly what -- at what point do you -- do you decide -- let's say there is a 50 percent chance based on historic -- historical evidence that the government would prosecute a particular crime, would investigate it to the point of prosecution. Is that enough to say that the investigation is reasonably foreseeable? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well, I -- I'm not exactly sure how this Court would apply the Arthur Andersen test or how courts of appeals have applied that in cases about when that needs to be an element of the offense. We think here that it's not a strict element of the offense, but it does come in through the mens rea.   So we think that if the -- if the investigation is really unthinkable, it's the sort of thing that nobody's going to get investigated or prosecuted for -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Right.   I understand the -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- then there's not going to be -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- I -- I understand the easy case and the hard case.   I'm trying to figure out exactly where you would draw the line. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I mean, I think, here, the -- the main place we're going to draw the line is about whether you have a specific intent to interfere with the process of justice. And so, if it's the type of offense that nobody is going to be prosecuted or investigated for, that prosecution isn't going to get brought -- they aren't going to get convicted. We're not going to have a conviction for accessory after the fact, which had, in Virginia, for instance, the mens rea of intending to influence -- intending to enable the felon to elude punishment. If you're intending to enable him to elude punishment for something that he was never going to be come after for, then it's going to be very difficult for the prosecution to prove that offense. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- putting aside the -- the -- the question of how exactly you draw the line, when you say that you don't want it to be an element of the offense and it's supposed to only come through the mens rea requirement, why are you arguing that, and what's the effect of that? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I -- I mean, the -- the practical effect and the why that we're arguing it is that there are essentially no statutes, not even the text of 1512, that include the 1512 -- I mean, that include the Court's gloss in Arthur Andersen to require there to be a reasonably foreseeable investigation.   We don't deny that that's part of 1512 since the Court construed the statute in 2005. But the -- all of the state obstruction-of-justice offenses, accessory after the fact, a lot of these other crimes, they weren't drafted in a post-Arthur Andersen age -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yeah, but it does seem -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- and nevertheless -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- right, that Arthur Andersen and then Marinello, where it says is it in the offing -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " It does, but I -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- you know, would -- would suggest that when we think of prototypical cases of obstruction, we're thinking of cases in which there is a proceeding or at least an investigation, as Marinello said, in the offing. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Yes, there needs to be a particular, in Marinello, tax proceeding that is in the offing.   It's not just day-to-day work of the IRS agents there.   But I would stress that Marinello relied on the phrase \"due administration of this title\" as echoing 1503, and that's -- that's language from the statute that was construed in Pettibone and Aguilar as needing a pending proceeding requirement. And even though the Title 26 provision had that similar language that is not in the INA, the Court still didn't require there to be an already pending investigation at the IRS in order for the Title 26 provision to apply. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " It said in the offing was good enough. And so, here, we think that an intent to interfere with something that really is conceivable essentially gets at the same point. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, this distinction matters, doesn't it, only in the case where the person who specifically intends to obstruct a future investigation is unreasonable in thinking that there will be a future investigation, right? That's the only instance in which it would -- it makes a difference whether this is a stand-alone element or whether it's subsumed by the intent requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " That's right that that's the only cases in which it's going to make a difference, but if you say that it needs to be an element of the offense -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No, I understand that. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- then -- then it would be harder for us to satisfy in a -- in a lot of cases where I think we would say the intent is going to sweep that in virtually all the time. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, I understand that. Let me ask you a question about Pettibone.   Do you interpret that as a decision that interpreted a specific statutory provision and the language of that specific statutory provision, or was the Court saying that obstruction of justice, like burglary or murder, is a common law offense and it has well-recognized elements, and so we are going to read this statute in accordance with a common law offense? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We -- we think it's clearly the former.   In Pettibone and in Aguilar and again in Marinello, the Court recognized that the phrases that mattered in 1503 were the reference to the \"due administration of justice\" and \"in any court.\" And so that's language that Congress included in the catch-all clause in 1503 that was construed originally in Pettibone in the 1890s and was carried through into the 1995 decision that Justice Sotomayor mentioned.   But that's still only the 1503 statute.   And we think it's quite clear that when Congress added 1512 in 1982, it also considered 1512 to be an obstruction-of-justice offense. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Gannon, can I ask you a question about this link between the two? Does it have to be linked to a particular proceeding? Because, at the time when a proceeding -- an investigation might be in the offing, I mean, I think some of our prior cases have required that link to be between a particular investigation. So you could threaten a witness and say, don't report this to the authorities.   But that could be state authorities.   It could be federal authorities.   There could be overlapping jurisdictional authority. So do you think it has to be close enough to an investigation for the defendant to suspect that state authorities might bring a particular investigation as opposed to the feds? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I -- I think it wouldn't matter which type of offense it would be.   If you were specifically trying to prevent a witness from going to either state or federal authorities about your -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Justice from anywhere? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- criminal conduct, that that is still a conceivable -- you're still interfering with the wheels of justice even though you don't know whether they're state or federal at that point. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Okay.   Let me ask you a different question then.   This goes back to Justice Sotomayor's point about you using obstruction of justice in a dictionary definition rather than looking at the elements of an offense. For perjury and bribery of a witness, I assume that you would agree, under the categorical approach, we would be looking to generic definitions of perjury and generic definitions of bribery of a witness. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I -- I think you could also look to the federal statutes that criminalize those crimes.   You would look to state statutes as well.   In a case like Esquivel-Quintana and -- where the Court was looking at sexual abuse of a minor, it recognized that this may be a family of offenses, and it said that statutory rape is just one part of the category that's covered by sexual abuse of a minor. Here, we think it's clear that -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But you wouldn't necessarily start -- I guess what I'm getting at is it seems like there are clusters here.   You have obstruction of justice, you have perjury, subornation of perjury, bribery of a witness, and it feels a little bit odd to be relying primarily on the dictionary definition, which is up at the highest level of generality for the first one but using kind of a more traditional approach for the others in the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We're not running away from the statutes.   We think that they support us.   Our main contention about the statutes is that 1503 isn't the only obstruction-of-justice offense at the federal level. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And do you draw -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " We think it's clear that Congress -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Okay.   Last -- last question then.   What does \"relating to\" do? What is an offense \"relating to\" bribery of a witness or \"relating to\" perjury? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " In -- it -- we think there it also expands the category a little bit. The Ninth Circuit in the Yim case held that \"relating to perjury\" extends a little bit further maybe than the elements of the offense. It held -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " What do you mean? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " It -- it held there that a federal perjury provision didn't necessarily -- the short answer is yes, we think that \"relating to\" adds to both obstruction of justice and the clauses that follow. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But why? If -- if obstruction of justice is itself a family, as you say, and I accept that, there's not a particular obstruction-of-justice offense that we call that or that Congress considered to be that, why isn't \"relating to obstruction of justice\" just describing the family? What I don't understand is why you have a group or a class called \"obstruction of justice,\" and then you interpret \"relating to\" to get you beyond that, as opposed to interpreting the entire phrase, \"relating to obstruction of justice,\" to say, refer to all of the offenses listed in 73.   I -- I don't know why -- I guess I'm just confused -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- as to why \"relating to\" is adding to -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- the classification that you say exists. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I -- I think, if you agree with us about the mens rea as being necessary to establish a sufficient connection in order to come in here even when it's relating to, then there isn't going to be any -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But why do I need to -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- practical difference between those two -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- can -- can we set the -- setting the mens rea aside -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- just trying to understand what you believe \"obstruction of justice\" in subparagraph (S) to be referring to. I've heard you say several times that it's a family, a classification. If I accept that and agree with you, then why isn't \"relating to obstruction of justice\" just describing that category? That would seem to be to me a way to limit because we don't have to worry about \"relating to\" as being beyond the class. And, second point, why isn't the class what Congress has listed in Chapter 73 and grouped together under the heading \"obstruction of justice\"? I don't know why you're going beyond a Chapter 73-type offense in your argument. "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Well, I -- I think that -- with respect to the first question, I understand your point about \"relating to.\" We think that the phrase generally is used by Congress to broaden things.   In this particular definition, when it's used in parentheticals, it's just a reference, a cross-reference, but we think, generally, it would be broader. But even taking your point about a family of offenses that's defined, as we think, by this common mens rea and various different potential actus reuses, that -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All of which runs through Chapter 73, right? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Yes, but it's not just limited to Chapter 73.   We think -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Why? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Because we think that other offenses are obstruction of justice.   And as I said already -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But isn't the -- but I'm saying, isn't the question what Congress intended? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Absolutely.   It is. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And so, if Congress says an offense relating to obstruction of justice, and then, in Chapter 73, they list a number of offenses under the heading \"obstruction of justice,\" I guess I don't understand why we are being directed to some sort of a generic categorical approach about a particular offense called obstruction of justice when that's really not a thing.   It seems like it's a class.   And here's a list of all of the things, some of which require a proceeding, some of which don't. Why isn't this the universe of -- of offenses plus the state law analogues to them? Why isn't that what Congress intended \"obstruction of justice\" to mean? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " I agree with everything there except to say that Chapter 73 defines the extent of the universe of parallel -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Why? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- offenses here.   And that's because it was clear by 1996 that accessory after the fact, for instance, the gist of that offense was obstruction of justice.   And the mere fact that -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Clear to whom and where? In the dictionary? Clear to -- to whom? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " Clear in -- in most circuit courts of the United -- of the federal circuit courts had said that about Section 3, and -- and many state courts had said that about their obstruction -- their accessory-after-the-fact offenses. Commentators, the LaFave treatise, the Model Penal Code commentary, all of these sources talked about offenses outside of Chapter 73 as also being paradigmatic obstruction-of-justice offenses. And so that's why we think that just looking to Chapter 73 isn't enough.   We think Chapter 73 provides good guidance.   There are clearly more than one obstruction-of-justice offense in Chapter 73, and, therefore, my friends' attempt to limit this to 1503 is too narrow.   But I -- we also think it's clear that Congress thought that there were obstruction-of-justice offenses outside Chapter 73, including, I would say -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But Congress didn't put -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E. Gannon", "text": " -- the Title 26 provision. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- but Congress did not put accessory after the fact in Chapter 73. So the -- the -- "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E.

But the -- but the -- we are asking about the core.   And it seems to me that your answer to this question is really not asking about the core.   It's asking, like, what's the outer bounds of the offense and what is anything that anybody has said is included in the offense, and then we're going to include all that in our definition of what a generic offense is.

So, in Nijhawan, in Kawashima, the Court was talking about offenses involving fraud or deceit, and it recognized that fraud can be mail fraud, it can be wire fraud, it can be conspiracy to defraud, it can be lots of other types of fraud. But the actus reus is -- can be a bunch of different things, but what it has to include is an intent to defraud.   Same with sexual abuse of a minor.   Statutory rape was as an example.

One option would be to look to the common law and to this Court's decisions in Pettibone and Aguilar and say, well, that usually meant at common law traditionally that there was an ongoing proceeding, obstruction of justice was contempt of court, things like that. The other is to look at dictionaries and say, well, there's some linguistic grift in this concept, and when we speak casually, the gist of any kind of thing that impedes an investigation -- failure to report a crime, accessory after the fact, witness tampering -- they -- they sound sort of like obstruction of justice, and they would fall within a contemporary dictionary definition.   So that should be the choice we make. Is that a fair summary of our two choices here? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E.

And I -- I take the point that that in some ways might be seen to -- might seem to help you, but might it also hurt you in another way in the sense that there Congress exhibited an understanding that normally obstruction of justice, as understood at common law, the soil that came with 1503, requires an ongoing offense, but not in this case, Congress said. So doesn't that kind of -- isn't it the exception that proves the rule? "}, {"speaker": "Curtis E.

It -- it could just be that there's a potential investigation there. And I think that in accessory after the fact, it talks about the intention to prevent apprehension, trial, or punishment.   All of those things -- apprehension, trial, or punishment -- are things that happen during the anticipated proceeding.   That's what the investigation or proceeding would be.   You are trying to hinder it right there in the element of the offense.   And that's why we agree with all those courts that said the gist of that offense is obstruction of justice. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Ms. Hutton. "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1996, when Congress chose to put the words \"offense relating to obstruction of justice\" into subsection (43)(S), it was choosing a term of art that meant interference with a pending proceeding. Just one year earlier, this Court had reaffirmed its century-old holding from Pettibone: obstruction can only arise when justice is being administered.   And it had further explained that any interference must have a close nexus to that pending proceeding. An offense that might or might not affect a proceeding is not obstruction.   No persuasive authority supports abandoning this well-settled, well-bounded definition for something looser, like a purpose to interfere with the process of justice. And doing so would be contrary to the notice and administrability concerns of the categorical approach itself.   It would leave courts, lawyers, and noncitizens to guess whether a predicate offense might at some point interfere with some possible process of justice and thus be an aggravated felony. Mr. Pugin's case demonstrates the overreach of this looser approach.   Accessory after the fact is a distinct offense.   It's being a party to another person's crime, not an esoteric variant of obstruction.   It is not, so to speak, in the family. It is recognized in the common law, in every state, and in the federal Criminal Code as something different, and so it is too big a leap to decide Congress meant to list it as an aggravated felony when it chose words that are the name of a different crime.   That kind of leap is the opposite of the interpretive restraint this Court uses in construing statutes with significant immigration and criminal consequences. The Court should instead stay on solid ground and confirm that an offense relating to obstruction of justice under (43)(S) requires a close nexus to a pending proceeding. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " And what do you mean by \"pending proceeding\"? Are you referring -- you seem to focus mostly on judicial proceedings. "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   Our point in explaining the core as the judicial proceedings that are protected by 1503, I think, is not to object to potentially including other official proceedings in that generic definition. It -- it certainly wouldn't matter for Mr. Pugin.   There's no proceeding involved in his -- his offense. But what I think it would illustrate is that already words like \"relating to\" or an expansive interpretation that might be underscored by using the categorical approach here is already doing some work because including an agency proceeding that might be from 1505, for example, would be expansive, but it would -- it would still be consistent with that core meaning. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So how would you confine that, though? What -- what about an investigation? "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " I think, again, an investigation is a step further out from the core definition and so should be viewed with some caution, but I don't think we would object necessarily to it being used here.   Accessory after the fact doesn't require an investigation. No one -- no one makes that contention. And, in 1503, grand jury investigations, for example, are included, and so it would be consistent with that core as well to include investigations. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I think the problem that we're having is that the government wants to broaden the definition.   It's like we're navigating between Scylla and Charybdis, and no one is giving us a way to get between the two extremes. And you're saying you would like to restrict it to a pending proceeding, but yet you admit that as you drift away from the core, that is, judicial proceedings, we have no way -- you're not giving us a way to navigate how far out do we go from that core proceeding. "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " Your Honor, I think the mast that -- that is -- that we're tied to here -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mm-hmm. "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " -- so to speak, is the proceeding requirement itself.   It is the core, it's the object, kind of grammatically, what are you protecting.   And there's nothing strange about saying, once justice has taken its most official form, that's something special to protect in a specific, discrete statute. And so we think the proceeding is what can't move.   I think my friend thinks the intent is what can't move.   If -- if -- if the issue is the beginning -- whether that proceeding has begun, the -- the Court has in other cases taken a little bit of an envelope around an existing proceeding and said, well, if it's in the offing, for example. I don't understand my friend to be proposing something like that, and that might be hard to administer in the categorical approach. But, again, with accessory after the fact, there needs -- nothing needs to be on the horizon. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

And I think, if you were to say punishment relating -- because of a concluded proceeding, a proceeding that has been pending, here's how it would be consistent, if I may, is -- is -- the pending proceeding, when it is occurring, part of what protects that is knowledge that afterwards a witness is not going to get killed without the law having some negative and deterrent effect towards that. And so you're still protecting the actual functioning process of justice, the wheels, when they are turning, in a way that would be, again, still consistent with the focus on the proceeding.

"}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " I think my friend is -- in their briefs gave the name temporal necklace -- excuse me, nexus -- it is the existence of the proceeding at some point.   I think we've used the word \"extant proceeding.\" I guess former proceeding would be fine too. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And accessory after the fact if there was a proceeding? I -- I guess I'm not understanding the distinction between retaliation and accessory after the fact that you're drawing.   Maybe I'm not following. "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " Your -- Your Honor, I think, if I may try to clarify, what -- what we would see as being consistent and involving a concluded proceeding would be something like interference related to a proceeding that has been pending.   So there has been a process and then a retaliatory offense like in 1503 where it's captured.   It is relating to that process. And, of course, there is the word \"relating,\" so maybe that's some use for it there. Accessory after the fact doesn't require that any authority of any kind ever have known or suspected that the -- that the principal's offense took place. If I lend Bob a shovel to go bury the gun he used, I may have some intent to help Bob avoid punishment, but we don't need to know that the sheriff is coming down the street or that the grand jury has issued an indictment.   There is no relationship -- the wheels are not yet turning, no accessory offense, prior to that. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But -- but the wheels would turn, so going to the temporal point beforehand, the wheels would turn if -- if you didn't take this act with the intent to frustrate the process of justice.

So, if someone who fears that he or she's going to be indicted by that grand jury approaches this witness on Sunday and says, here's $10,000 and a ticket to a place where there's no extradition treaty, be on that flight and stay there until we let you know or we're going to wipe out your family.

I want to be clear, under a categorical approach analysis, the question would be: Do the elements of the -- the state crime fit the elements of the generic crime?

It is simply entirely prospective and possible. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

I think our focus was to try to answer the question that the Court presented: What is -- what is obstruction of justice? It's a -- interference with a judicial proceeding. And if it is expanded beyond that, and there are some principled ways to do that that we've discussed here, maybe that's giving effect to the categorical approach; maybe that's giving effect to \"relating to.\" That might be -- include these other investigations, proceedings. We don't necessarily take issue with that.   It doesn't make a difference for Mr. Pugin.   And I think it might also be good to look at that in another case where the type of proceeding did matter.

Courts have said Chapter 73 is a group that defines this.   The Third Circuit, for example.

I wanted to get -- "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " Yeah.

"}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " I think our position is different than that.   We do think there is a generic meaning.   I think the BIA might have gotten close to it in the Espinoza case with the specific intent to interfere with an existing proceeding-type analysis, which it then backed away from.

So I'm just trying to home in on whether your view is that when Congress said offenses related to obstruction of justice, they were talking about a single obstruction-of-justice offense to start and then offenses that were somehow related to that -- that -- that single offense. "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, we do think it was -- it was thinking more singularly from Aguilar just one year before.   That's what obstruction of justice is.   If it's going to be a family, perhaps Chapter 73 is a way to look at that.

So, if -- if I disagree and if I'm looking at the entire chapter of 73, with all the various ones that say obstruction or that use \"obstruct\" in their language, which is a number of them, why is it that you say that your client doesn't fit any of those -- any of those offenses? "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " So two reasons.   First is that if you look through all of those statutes, there is a strong current of a pending proceeding requirement.   So we believe that does -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " What about 18, 1518? It doesn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Martha Hutton", "text": " Well, that was passed after (43)(S).   We don't think it's particularly informative.   And -- and -- and I don't want to take the position that every single statute there has a pending proceeding requirement. 1512 clearly doesn't. But we think there's that strong trend there that if you're going to define a generic crime using interpretive restraint, which is the approach this Court has adopted, then -- then you need that pending proceeding requirement. But, of course, the main point for Mr. Pugin's case, accessory after the fact is in there.   It's not a match to a Chapter 73 offense.   No court that has looked at this problem through that lens has found that it is, and I don't -- I don't think anyone is saying it's a close match for one of those offenses.

Fleming", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The categorical approach doesn't turn on whether an offense seems like or has the gist or feels like it has the effect of obstructing justice.   It turns, Justice Jackson, to your question, on the elements of the generic crime of obstruction of justice as traditionally understood. The government's argument today would sweep in convictions for failure to report a crime or for simply urging someone to deal with a traffic accident informally rather than calling the police, and that is an offense under the California statute at issue in Mr. Cordero-Garcia's case. Had Congress meant to treat convictions like that as aggravated felonies, it would not have used the phrase \"obstruction of justice,\" which, through longstanding usage, has required interference with a pending investigation or proceeding.   That's because it's only then that the defendant is intentionally interfering with a legal process. Now the generic definition that we propose still captures numerous convictions, like corruptly influencing jurors, threatening prosecutors, or lying to investigating officers, and broader offenses like California's that do not require a pending investigation may still be deportable, but they are not aggravated felony obstruction of justice. I want to make sure that I get to \"relating to\" and that I try to help the Court between Scylla and Charybdis, but at this point, I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " What exactly is the generic crime of obstruction of justice? "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " Our proposed definition, Justice Thomas, is the BIA's definition simply requiring a pending investigation or proceeding.

"}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So where do you get that? "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " Well, we get it -- we get it from the BIA, we get it from the ordinary meaning, and we get it from state and federal crimes of obstruction of justice, which -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So, when you talk about the states and you went through them in your brief -- "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " -- which of the state laws should we choose as a comparator? And on -- in your analysis, what was the basis of your choices? "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " So we look at the state -- so, at the first step of the categorical approach, which is the statutory interpretation step, we look to how states have defined the crime of obstruction of justice. And this is why we think the government engages in the wrong exercise, because it looks at state crimes or even whole portions of state codes that use different labels, like offenses against public administration or governmental administration. That tells us nothing about what Congress meant when it said obstruction of justice. There are 15 states that in 1996 defined crimes of obstruction of justice, and more than half required a pending proceeding. We counted eight, and then the government rightly pointed out in their reply in Footnote 8 that we undercounted because we have the right to claim Virginia. So there are nine out of 15 that do require a pending proceeding.   Two are ambiguous.   One requires a reasonably foreseeable proceeding.   Only three of 15 support the government's position. I -- the -- I do want to address the response that Mr. Gannon previewed in his opening, which is, well, it can't be that only 15 jurisdictions criminalize obstruction of justice. The point is, when states criminalize this kind of behavior, sometimes they use different names for their offenses, and at the first step of the categorical approach, that's not relevant to the statutory interpretation exercise.   We're looking at what Congress defined the generic obstruction-of-justice offense to be in 1996. However, at the second step, when the time comes to compare state convictions to the federal generic, there are plenty of other offenses that are going to qualify as generic obstruction of justice. We cite some of them in Footnote 18 of our brief: California Penal Code 95, corrupt influencing of jurors; Colorado 18-8-608, intimidating of a juror; 609, jury tampering; New York Penal Law 2-15-13.   I can go on.   There are many of them that are going to qualify. But, when you are trying to determine what the -- the elements of the federal generic crime of obstruction of justice is -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, many -- "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " -- you look at -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- many before and after the proceeding, many of those crimes, although not with the label, are before or after the proceeding, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " So -- so some of the retaliation crimes can be charged if the proceeding has concluded. And on that point, Justice Kavanaugh, I'd agree with Ms. Hutton that I think -- well, first of all, it -- it doesn't affect the outcome in either of these cases.   So, if the Court were to include retaliation after the proceeding is concluded, that would still require -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Then the temporal point's lost then. On -- on the before point, I guess I'm not sure why Congress in 1996 wouldn't have been looking at the body of federal law of obstruction crimes, and those included a variety of crimes where the proceeding did not yet have to be pending, and to your point about the generic offense, I don't understand why, therefore, to follow up on Justice Thomas, it's not defined as acts taken with the willful intent to obstruct the legal process. "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " Well, so -- so, to -- to take the federal Chapter 73 first, the -- the overwhelming majority of provisions in Chapter 73 in 1996 did require a pending proceeding, fully 12 out of 16. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Right.   But you -- you're aware, right, that Congress specifically in '45 and '67 broadened past the core that had been in 1893 of just having a pending proceeding, and they did it in both directions: the retaliation afterwards and some of the offenses that could be considered obstruction beforehand. Do you agree with that history? "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " Well, certainly, Your Honor.   And I'm not -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.

None of that tells you what Congress meant when it used the specific generic offense phrase, \"obstruction of justice.\" The states, the vast majority that did use that phrase did require a pending proceeding.   The government's pointed to only three of them that didn't. Now, when we get to Chapter 73, again, you have a situation where -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

If there's a pending proceeding or investigation, then it will be generic obstruction of justice. Congress is free and this Court can use the phrase in other ways, but those are nongeneric usages of the term, just like breaking into a car can be called burglary.   It has the gist of burglary, it sounds like burglary, but it isn't generic burglary as this Court has consistently recognized it. Unlawful sexual intercourse with someone who is 17 years old sounds like sexual abuse of a minor.   Some states call that sexual abuse of a minor, but it's not generic sexual abuse of a minor, as this Court expressly said in Esquivel-Quintana.   So that's how I would account for the minority of offenses within Chapter 73, where Congress in 1512 expressly has said we are not requiring a pending investigation or a pending proceeding here precisely because the generic form of the offense did require it. When they wanted to create offenses that were not generic, they said so, or they created a specialized idiosyncratic provision to address, for instance, healthcare offenses in 1518. Those are crimes.   It's perfectly fine to call them crimes.   It's perfectly fine to even call them obstruction of justice.

Burglary was what was involved in Taylor, which gave rise to this categorical approach.   It's a common law offense.   And the elements of that common law offense were well known, so that was the basis for saying that these are the elements of generic burglary. But obstruction of justice is not the same.

Now recall \"relating to\" is used 24 times in the aggravated felony provision.   It is -- 20 out of 24, it's definitional purely.   It's just that it's followed by a cross-reference to a particular federal statute. In the other situations in which it's used, it is used in exactly the way Your Honor described, which is to say, look, these may not be called bribery, it may not be called perjury; it might be called obstruction of justice.   So we want to make sure you don't get hung up on the -- on the title of the offense.   But that doesn't change the elements of the generic offense of obstruction of justice any more than it does for bribery or perjury. So we don't think it has an expansive effect -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But -- but -- "}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " -- if this -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

"}, {"speaker": "Mark C. Fleming", "text": " When -- no, when you're interpreting obstruction of justice. Obstruction of justice is a generic offense that has elements, just like perjury, just like bribery.

It might be called tampering with a juror.   That's fine. If the Court disagrees with me on that, I do think there could be some expansive work that \"relating to\" would do, but it does not get the government as far as they want to get.   I think, for instance, it could have to -- it could expand -- there are a lot of states, for instance, that criminalize a bribe -- a bribe receiving by a witness or a juror.   So not just bribing a witness, but the witness -- if the witness solicits a bribe and says, I'll change my testimony if you give me a thousand dollars, that is a criminal offense on the part of the witness or on the part of the juror. New York Penal Law 215.05, Nevada 199.250. There are lots of others. That could relate to obstruction because it's not itself obstruction.   The witness doesn't have to change the testimony in order to be guilty of that offense, and they don't need specific intent necessarily to obstruct the proceeding.   They just want the money.   So -- so that might be relating to obstruction. Solicitation of obstruction of justice: I really wish you'd lie to the grand jury in their investigation for me.

I talked about falsely making or altering a passport, which does sound an awful like the process of justice if it's used as broadly as the government says. Subsection (M)(2) pertaining to tax evasion, that also sounds like something that presumably would -- would hinder the process of justice under the government's view.   There's no limiting principle in the government's view for -- for how to exclude that. I -- I'd also say that there's a significant administrability problem with what the government is trying to do here.   It would basically include almost everything, including failure to report a crime, failure to assist a police officer.   There are all kinds of state law offenses here that the government would sweep in that intuitively do not sound like aggravated felonies, and I think it would require a lot more clarity to think that that's what Congress meant to treat as an aggravated felony.

Likewise, a person arrested by a civilian, e.g., a shopkeeper, may face criminal charges by trying to talk the shopkeeper into not calling the police. Mr. Wahidi himself didn't threaten anybody.   He had gotten into an altercation with someone outside a mosque, and then he went and said, you know, we're both Muslims, we should try to have our families settle this rather than informing the authorities. He didn't threaten the person.   He didn't say, I'm going to do anything to you if you call the police.   All he wanted to do was settle it.   He was convicted.   His conviction was affirmed.   This is an extremely broad provision.

I would say that both of my friends have conceded that there may be an investigation and that it starts at a certain point, and -- and they would concede that that works. But that doesn't concede that any other statutes come in because, under the categorical approach, if they want that to be an element of the offense, that's going to be a vanishingly small category, as they've acknowledged today. They've said that only 14 states plus D.C. are the denominator for trying to analyze this because you only look at obstruction-of-justice offenses, and we don't think that that gets the categorical approach analysis correct.   But I would say we return to what the BIA was saying. And, Justice Kagan, you asked about reasonable foreseeability.   That is in the Board's definition as part of the mens rea. This is at page 460 of the Valenzuela Gallardo III decision, where the Board states this, and it specifically says that -- that it's an affirmative and -- and intentional attempt that is motivated by a specific intent to interfere either in an investigation or proceeding that is ongoing, pending, or reasonably foreseeable. So it's in the part of the definition that it's about a specific intent to interfere with that.   That's consistent with what we're arguing today about how that comes in. But, if you look at the California offense that Mr. Fleming was just talking about, it comes in because it has the specific intent to influence a potential witness's or victim's testimony or acts.   That's quoted in our brief at page 6.   And, in this instance, it's a serious offense, we know, because he was -- by Congress's lights, because he was sentenced to a year in prison for each of the two counts. And so, here, we think it's clear that the family of offenses in federal law includes not just 1503 but also 1512 and Section 3, accessory of -- accessory-after-the-fact offenses.
