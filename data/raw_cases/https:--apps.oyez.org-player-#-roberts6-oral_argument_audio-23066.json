[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 12-794, White v. Woodall.   Ms. Lenz? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   This Court has repeatedly held that a State prisoner cannot obtain habeas relief under AEDPA unless State court contravenes or unreasonably applies clearly established Federal law.   In this case, there was no clearly established Federal law.   Under any interpretation of Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell, this Court has never extended Carter to the selection phase of a capital sentencing trial.   Because there is no clearly established Federal law, the Kentucky Supreme Court was well within its authority to resolve this unresolved question in favor of affirming the sentence. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Ms. Lenz, could I ask you about what you just said?   You said Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell; those are the three.   So Carter says the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give a no-adverse-inference jury instruction when requested by a defendant.   And that was, of course, not a sentencing case.   Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital murder trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment; so a kind of general view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the two.   And then Mitchell holds -- it basically repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial phase.   So when you put those together, Carter with Estelle, Mitchell, how -- why do you think that there's a gap? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, there's -- there is a gap between Mitchell and Carter.   First of all, Mitchell was not a jury instruction case.   In Mitchell, while the defendant did plead guilty, she did not plead guilty to all of the conduct, so there were still factors that were being contested.   In this case, Mr. Woodall pled guilty to all of the crimes and aggravating circumstances.   Mitchell and Estelle were both concerned with protecting the defendant from the prosecution shifting its burden of proof to the defendant.   In this case, there was no -- there was no burden shifting because Robert Keith Woodall had already pleaded guilty to the facts which the prosecutor was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to render Mr. Woodall eligible for the death penalty.

This is a punishment hearing.   He has chosen not to -- not to testify in this -- in this hearing.   You -- you are -- if you wish, you may take his failure to testify as an indication that he does not have remorse, that he is not sorry.   He could have come before you said and said I am terribly sorry, I wish I had never done it, I will never do it again.   He has chosen not to testify.   You may, if you wish, take that into account in determining whether -- whether there is remorse.   You can't say that? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Oh, absolutely.   Absolutely. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, then your answer should have been otherwise. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, I guess I interpreted Justice Sotomayor's question a little bit different because she wasn't referring to facts in evidence or -- or to some type of evidence.   But your question asks the -- the question about whether silence bears on the determination of a lack of remorse. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Of course. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " And Mitchell specifically left that open.   In fact, Mitchell-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Well, there was a factual dispute as to how much the witness -- the victim had suffered.   How about a statement about that? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " --Well, I don't think there was actually a dispute about how much the victim suffered.   There, I think, you are referring to the testimony of the blood spatter expert where -- wherein he was talking about how the blood was splattered around, it indicated that there had been quite a struggle when the victim's throat was slashed.   And trial counsel-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But take the -- take the hypothetical, Ms. Lenz, that suppose, you know, the prosecutor had said you just heard testimony from our expert that -- the blood spattering expert, that the victim's suffering was especially prolonged, and look, the defendant didn't take the stand.   Why didn't he take the stand to deny that?   All right?   So could the prosecutor have said that at the sentencing hearing? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " --Yes, Justice Kagan.   The prosecutor could have said that because that is a selection factor.   That -- the fact of whether the victim struggled is not a fact that makes the defendant eligible for the death penalty.   So because the -- the prosecutor had no burden of proof on that, the defendant wasn't in -- in jeopardy of having the burden shifted to him. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So you're suggesting that what we haven't decided, if you will, goes beyond the remorse question of -- that we -- that we talked about in -- not Mitchell, but -- is it Mitchell? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Mitchell, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It goes beyond the remorse question.   And you're saying that really, in the sentencing hearing, the Fifth Amendment has nothing to do with -- with anything that happens there essentially, because once -- once the person has been found eligible for the death penalty, a prosecutor and a jury can -- can draw whatever inferences they want. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " I think that the core purpose of the Fifth Amendment has -- has been protected.   Yes, I do. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What do we do about -- I mean, I think the relevant pages are -- it's at 526 U.S. 328 to 330.   Probably read those 17 times.   All right.   When I looked at those, I saw they reaffirmed Estelle.   As they quote Estelle, they say its reasoning applies with full force.   Estelle says,   \"The court could discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned. \"   I marked five separate statements in those two pages that came to the same thing.   I looked at Estelle.   Estelle has to do with the right to note -- note the comment that he wanted in respect to a sentencing fact that the jury was going to decide; namely, future dangerousness.   Nothing to do with a fact about the crime.   A sentencing fact.   So then I said, well, what favors you here?   What favors you is the last sentence of the first paragraph on 330, which says,   \"Whether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in 3E1.1 of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines is a separate question. \"   \"It is not before us and we express no view on it. \"   Right.   It's, one, not just a sentencing fact, but a state of mind of the defendant, lack of remorse; two, it's in the sentencing guidelines; three, it is a decision for a judge, not the jury.   If it isn't confined as I just said it, then Mitchell overrules Estelle, what it explicitly denies doing.   Here we have sentencing facts, facts about his childhood.   He wanted the Estelle instruction.   The judge wouldn't give it.   That's the argument against you, I think.   And I would like to hear your specific response. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, in Estelle, that sentencing factors future dangerousness, and the prosecution had to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt in order to make Mr. Smith eligible for the death penalty.   That's a very different fact than a factor of what you're speaking about, which would be a selection factor and the prosecution has-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, I thought the facts -- what was at issue here, he has put on witnesses that show that he had a bad childhood and he didn't himself testify about his bad childhood.   And in that context, he asked for the no silence/silence instruction.   The government did not object.   The judge then refused to give the instruction.   All right.   Now, what's the difference between the facts about how his parents raised him and the fact of future dangerousness in Estelle? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " --The difference is the burden of proof.   How his parents raised him is a mitigating circumstance.   Mr. Woodall had the burden of proof on mitigating circumstances.   The jury was instructed they had to consider the mitigating circumstances.   So whether Mr. Woodall testified or not, we assume that the jury followed the instructions and considered the mitigating circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Ms. Lenz, am I correct, the instruction that was requested but not given was as follows: Quote,   \"A defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way. \"   That was the instruction? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Yes, sir. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So suppose that the -- you put on evidence of -- to show that he was qualified for the death penalty and put on evidence of aggravating factors, and the defense put on absolutely no mitigation evidence.   The instruction would say, would it not, that the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way with respect to the failure to put on any mitigation evidence at all?   Is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " That's exactly right, Your Honor.   That's exactly right.   So, in essence, it really shifts the burden of proof, Mr. Woodall's burden of proof, back to the prosecution. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " In this case, of course, the question is even narrower.   That instruction would forbid the jury from even taking into account his failure to testify on -- on the one factor of remorse -- the one psychological factor of remorse.   And if you say that you're not entitled to such an instruction on that, that alone would have -- would have been enough to deny the requested instruction. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " That's exactly right.   And I think the judge indicates-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could you call him to ask him if he feels sorry?   If he has no Fifth Amendment right, could you call him to the stand and ask him, are you sorry? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " --No, Justice Sotomayor, because there are two rulings in Mitchell, and the first ruling in Mitchell says that -- said that Mitchell still had the Fifth Amendment right in the sentencing proceeding after the guilty plea.   That's the first ruling in Mitchell.   But the second ruling in Mitchell then limits that.   It doesn't say there are no adverses, no adverse inferences whatsoever that can be inferred.   It says no adverse inferences can be inferred on facts and circumstances that the prosecutor is required to prove which increase the penalty range.   So there's a difference.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Is your position basically that this is in the nature of a -- an affirmative defense and that defendant carries the burden on remorse -- and what was the other one that Mitchell saved out?   Acceptance of responsibility? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " --Yes.   Yes, Justice Ginsburg. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So if defendant says nothing, then he hasn't -- he hasn't proved a mitigator. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R.

The prosecution has absolutely no burden with regard to mitigating circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

"}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " The -- the assumption in my question is that the defendant has the burden of proof on a certain number of issues in the sentencing hearing.   As to all of those issues, it seems to me it has to be your position that the government is entitled to the instruction that I described.

"}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Yes.   Well, I think it would be the same answer.   It's just that remorse is a mitigating circumstance and the prosecution has no burden of proof on mitigating circumstances.   That's the defendant's choice as to whether he wants to place evidence in the record regarding any mitigating circumstances whatsoever. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, when a party has the burden of producing evidence on something, isn't the customary way of dealing with that to instruct the jury that the defendant had the burden of producing evidence to show this, rather than to -- to talk about inferences that can be drawn from their failure, from that party's failure to produce evidence. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, in this case the jury was not instructed that Mr. Woodall had the burden of proof on the mitigating circumstances.   They were instructed to consider the mitigating circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " They also weren't instructed to draw any inferences, were they? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " No, they were not.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, the jury was instructed:   \"You shall consider such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances as have been presented to you in the evidence and you believe to be true. \"   Now, I suppose they could have been -- the mitigating evidence could have been put in by the prosecution, but for the most part they're going to be put in by the defense.   So when the judge says you can consider whatever mitigating evidence has been presented to you, isn't that tantamount to saying that the defendant has the burden of producing evidence of mitigation if the defendant wants to do that? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " I don't think it speaks to who has the burden.   It just speaks to the fact that they're required to consider-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I thought we -- it wasn't controversial that on mitigating factors the defendant does have the burden. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " --He does.   He does.   That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So is -- is there a difference between the prosecutor saying, judge, I want you to charge this jury that they can use defendant's silence against him, or a judge on his own telling the jury that, or the judge, as here, simply refusing to say you can't take it into account?

Because I thought that every time and in every circumstance that we've prohibited an adverse inference we've also required a requested jury instruction.   I don't know of a -- of a case or any principle that would suggest that we can tear those two things apart and say, well, look, an adverse inference is prohibited, but, no, you don't get an instruction. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, the -- the only situation that I I'm aware of that the Court has, that it has extended Griffin with this Carter instruction is in the guilt phase, where the prosecution is still required to prove guilt.

Because my -- my sort of reading of our case law is that they do.   Any time we've said an adverse inference is prohibited, we've also said the defendant is titled -- is entitled to an instruction about adverse inferences if he requests it. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, you said that in every case, but one, I suppose, except for Mitchell; and that's the most important case here.   The Court in Mitchell said that the jury couldn't infer anything negative from the facts and circumstances of the crime upon which the prosecutor-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I didn't see that in Mitchell.   But let -- let me go back, just elaborating on that, to Justice Alito's first question.   I want to see if this issue is still in the case.   You looked at the instruction, and the instruction is just a broad instruction.   It says no adverse inference may be drawn from anything.   All right.   So there seemed to be some objection you had to the breadth of that instruction.   So I looked at the instruction.   The instruction does say exactly what Justice Alito said and you have said.   It says the -- the instruction is --   \"The defendant is not compelled to testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in any way. \"   with a couple of, here, irrelevant modifications.   All right?   The instruction I just read you is not from this case.   It's from the Carter case.   In the Carter case, the court said that instruction must be given.   It must be given at the sentencing phase.   So what they did was copy the instruction out of the case, the very instruction that the court said, in Carter, the Fifth Amendment requires to be given in the sentencing phase.   And that was a noncapital case.   So what's the objection to the instruction, on its breadth?   Not only is it the same, but the government never objected that it was too broad, and the only issues in the case were factual.   They were about what happened to him in his childhood, namely, sentencing facts.   And the instruction that you did read about what they should consider referred to facts and circumstances.   And where in Estelle does it say that matters at sentencing related to facts and circumstances, you don't have to give the very instruction that Carter and Estelle required? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " --All right.   I have several things to say.   First of all, I disagree with two things, respectfully, that you said about Carter.   The instruction in Carter was different.   The instruction in Carter was about guilt, and actually -- and Mr. Woodall concedes -- they left that part out of this instruction.   This instruction says no negative inferences about anything whatsoever.   That's not what Carter said. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I see. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Carter is talking about guilt, and it's limited.   And also, the Carter instruction had to do with the guilt phase rather than the sentencing phase.   And Estelle was not a jury instruction case and didn't say anything about Carter whatsoever.   So Estelle didn't extend Carter at all. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But Mitchell did, though, the sentencing aspect. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " I'm sorry? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mitchell was about sentencing. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Yes, Mitchell was about sentencing.   And Mitchell is the case which answers the -- the last part of the question, Justice Breyer.   You said where does it say facts and circumstances of the crime?   That language is in Mitchell.   Mitchell clearly says that no adverse inferences may be made on facts and circumstances of the crime upon which the prosecution has the burden of proof and -- and upon which will increase-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Does it overrule -- does it overrule Estelle? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " --Does Mitchell overrule Estelle? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes.   Does Mitchell -- Estelle talks about -- you apply the same rule to facts and circumstances of the sentence, in a capital case anyway. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, I don't think Mitchell says that.   It's not that broad. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, Mitchell doesn't. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Or excuse me.   Estelle doesn't say that.   Estelle's not that broad.   It doesn't speak about a jury instruction.   And even Mitchell doesn't say -- it -- it says something very broad, the Fifth Amendment applies during the penalty phase, but it doesn't make a distinction between the eligibility part of the penalty phase and the selection part of the penalty phase. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But in not making that distinction, I mean, it does speak very broadly, and it says, you know -- I'm reading another quotation from it.   \"The rule against negative inferences at a criminal trial apply with equal force at sentencing. \"   Now, it does have this exception for remorse or a possible exception for remorse.   But with that exception, otherwise, it says the rule against adverse inferences applies, doesn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, the rule against adverse inferences from Carter is all about incrimination and guilt.   And in this case, Mr. Woodall's pled guilty to all of the crimes and aggravating circumstances.   So his eligibility for the death penalty was already met before the penalty phase even began.   And I'm sorry.   What was your question? "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I think my question was just the breadth of these statements about everything that applies at trial with respect to adverse inferences also applies at the sentencing phase, with the possible exception of adverse inferences about remorse.   That's the way I read the cases. "}, {"speaker": "Susan R. Lenz", "text": " Well, I'm not sure I agree with your reading of the cases, but even if -- even if that is the correct reading of the case and that adverse inferences apply to everything but factors such as lack of remorse or downward adjustment in the sentencing guidelines, that leaves a huge hole in Mitchell.   You could drive a truck through that hole because, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent in Mitchell, the bulk of what sentencing is about are these other factors, the other factors, what kind of childhood he had, mitigation and all of that sort of thing.   So there's still a lot of room.   If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Komp.

It is true that the Carter instruction refers to guilt.   You took that instruction, word for word, and you've cut out \"guilt\" because this has nothing to do with guilt, right.   Estelle says, I would think, that you have a right to a Carter instruction in respect to some sentencing factors, namely future dangerousness.   The last sentence on the page of Mitchell says: We are not deciding whether you're entitled to that instruction in respect to other sentencing fabricators, namely remorse.   So the question for you is why does that thing -- that sentence about remorse in Mitchell, why isn't it at least ambiguous about whether your client is entitled to that instruction here?   And your response to that is what? "}, {"speaker": "Laurence E. Komp", "text": " My -- my response to that is -- is twofold.   One, as -- in -- as this Court was walking through in the opening presentation, Mitchell was not overruled -- or, I'm sorry, Estelle was not overruled by Mitchell.

When you get to that-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, Estelle might not have been overruled, but there's a caveat that Mitchell puts in, and it's a caveat about remorse and that remorse might be different.   And the question is why doesn't that caveat suggest, at the very least, that the instruction that you asked for was so broad that it went beyond what this Court has decided.   Because the instruction that you asked for did not distinguish remorse from other issues that were going to come before the jury at the sentencing phase.   So at the very least it seems that instruction sort of blows by the question that we have reserved. "}, {"speaker": "Laurence E. Komp", "text": " --Two points, and one is, when this instruction was requested, Mitchell had not been decided.   So the slate was Griffin, Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell came out prior to the Kentucky Supreme Court's ruling.   So this instruction was based on -- you know, without the reservation that exists. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but then the reservation certainly suggests that at the time the instruction was requested, it wasn't beyond any fair-minded dispute, which is the standard.   No one's talked about the standard yet.   The standard is that -- which you're complaining about -- that the error has to be so well understood and comprehended in existing law to be beyond any possibility of fair-minded disagreement.   And it seems to me if shortly after the instruction was requested the court itself said, oh, that's different, we're not talking about that, it certainly suggests that it was a subject of fair-minded disagreement. "}, {"speaker": "Laurence E. Komp", "text": " I think you have -- we have to examine what Mitchell -- Mitchell, again, was framed as a Federal sentencing guidelines case, and that passage I read earlier from Mitchell, the next sentence is:   \"And although Estelle was a capital case, its reasoning applies with full force here, where the government seeks to use Petitioner's silence to infer commission of disputed acts. \"   And what -- what this Court was doing was extending Estelle into the Federal sentencing guidelines case, and it wasn't at the same time cutting back on Estelle the Fifth -- the recognition that the Fifth Amendment applies at the capital sentencing.   Our read of that exception, the language, is that whether silence bears upon the determination of lack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in the sentencing guidelines is a separate question. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Not only that.   Your position must be that that is so clear as to be beyond fair-minded disagreement. "}, {"speaker": "Laurence E.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but you're saying it has to be clear, objectively beyond reasonable disagreement, to say that when the court says lack of remorse in a sentencing guideline case it still thinks there's a different rule for lack of remorse in a selection case such as this. "}, {"speaker": "Laurence E. Komp", "text": " But I think the answer is found within Estelle, because Estelle was based on the future dangerousness, and the psychiatrist that -- or, pardon me, psychologist that testified in Estelle, his finding of future dangerousness, which is a selection question which has nothing to do with eligibility, his finding of future dangerousness was based on lack of remorse.   Estelle isn't just a compulsion case.   There was a component of silence. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I thought your friend told us that future dangerousness was an eligibility factor rather than a mere selection criteria. "}, {"speaker": "Laurence E. Komp", "text": " Under this Court's -- the then Texas statute as defined by this Court in Jurek, that special circumstances question at that time was a selection factor.   It was not an eligibility factor.   Eligibility had already been determined.   And that's based on this Court's authority in Jurek.   And we -- and we cited to State v. Brethard in the Red Brief, which is Texas's description of their -- of those special circumstances questions at the time.   So this Court has applied this Fifth Amendment prohibition in a pure sentencing selection occasion, and Estelle deals with -- there's a component of silence to it because the psychologist that testified as to the future dangerousness factor relied on the silence of the individual, his failure specifically to say I'm sorry and express remorse about the actions that he did.   And this Court cited that component as part of what the psychologist relied on in making the future dangerousness assessment.   So Estelle is not totally -- it obviously has a compulsion component and it's driven by the Miranda violation, but there is a component of Estelle which relies specifically on silence and how the silence was used to penalize the individual in becoming a factor in favor of death in the selection process.

And all that Mitchell did in that one sentence is reserve a question that -- that may or may not be applicable in Federal sentencing or noncapital sentencing.

This Court-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But that's perfectly clear.   I mean, if you were arguing the other way, you would say, well, the question is whether it's clearly if there's a clear difference between lack of remorse in the sentencing guideline case and lack of remorse in a capital case, and everybody knew that, so that when Mitchell just said it doesn't apply to lack of remorse in the sentencing guidelines nobody would think that meant that there was an open issue on the capital context.

Komp", "text": " Well, they -- that's the natural, what this Court recognizes, the natural inclinations of what jurors do.   And this prosecutor -- and it's laid out in our Red Brief -- although he technically said,   \"I'm not going to argue lack of remorse, but I'm going to do everything but that. \"   So that was clearly where -- where he was pointing.   The other -- what -- the other impact it has is this was a case that there was strong mitigation.   This is somebody who's borderline mentally retarded, has a personality disorder which doesn't allow him to function in society.   But there's also a strong element of Skipper evidence.   So when you're asking for a life without parole and you have expert testimony saying this individual is not going to be a danger to correction officers, and you have a jailer that testifies that he's well-mannered and well-behaved and is not a problem at all, and you have the background that he has, this -- that's a strong mitigation narrative.
