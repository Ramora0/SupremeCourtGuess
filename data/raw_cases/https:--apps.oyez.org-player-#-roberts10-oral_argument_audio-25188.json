[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1195, Espinoza versus the Montana Department of Revenue. Mr. Komer. "}, {"speaker": "Richard D. Komer", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case asks whether the Federal Constitution allows the wholesale exclusion of religious schools from scholarship programs.   It does not. Yet, Montana's Blaine Amendment requires that exclusion.   As a result, the Blaine Amendment discriminates against religious conduct, beliefs, and status in violation of the free-exercise clause under Trinity Lutheran. The Montana Supreme Court disagreed.   That court held that barring religious schools from the program did not violate the Federal Constitution.   This Court should reverse that judgment. Even Respondents now concede that excluding religious schools from the program is unconstitutional, but they argue that the court avoided this discrimination by invalidating the entire program.   This is wrong.   The only reason the court invalidated the program was because it included religious schools. And the court's remedy did not cure its discriminatory judgment, nor should the remedy shield the judgment from review. Petitioners brought this lawsuit because they were denied scholarships based on religion, and they are still being denied scholarships based on religion.   If the court had shut down the program because it included Muslim schools or African-American schools, there's no question that would be unconstitutional.   We ask you to reverse. Respondents argue in the alternative that Locke allows them to exclude the religious schools and that this case falls within the play in the joints.   But that would allow the exception to swallow the rule.   As Trinity Lutheran made clear, the rule is religious neutrality and Locke only a narrow exception. We argue that Locke is the exception that proves the rule.

Wall", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Montana Supreme Court held that the Montana constitution requires religious discrimination that the federal constitution forbids.   Parents may not direct scholarships to schools solely because those schools are religiously affiliated. Now, the state doesn't defend that error of federal law, but says it was washed away when the court invalidated the entire program and left everyone empty-handed. The Montana Supreme Court had no power under federal law to invalidate anything.   It relied on a state constitutional provision that is inconsistent with and preempted by the federal free-exercise clause, and, crucially, Petitioners continue to suffer from that federal free exercise violation regardless of whether any parents received scholarships or also suffer as collateral damage. If the Montana Supreme Court had invalidated this program because it included historically African-American schools or all-girl schools, that would be a straightforward equal-protection violation. Nothing about it would be cured by the fact that other parents had been denied funding as well. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So your -- your -- I'm sorry.   Oh, you're good.

They've had them for years, and under the court's decision, they lose them at the end of this school year.   So even I don't take the state to be challenging Article III injury. And so then it's just a question of whether they're raising their own rights and they are because the reason they're being excluded from the program, everybody would say, the answer to the question, why don't these parents get their scholarships, because they want to direct the scholarships to religious schools. Their free exercise is being penalized.   They're not raising a right on behalf of the state.   Everybody concedes that if all the parents in this program had wanted to choose secular schools, there'd be no basis for the state's court ruling.   The scholarship program would still exist.   It's only because some parents said I want to send my kids to schools like Stillwater, and at that point, at page 30 of the Petition Appendix, the state supreme court says we have a state constitutional guarantee, no state funds to religious schools.

You are suggesting now that Montana in 1972 went through an empty exercise, they looked at the history of this amendment or one like it, said it was odious, admitted -- some of its people who voted for this bill in '72 said it was a despicable history, but they then looked at the founding fathers' writings, they looked at the State of Montana's religious tolerance, which had changed dramatically from the Blaine Amendment era, and decided that they were going to side with James Madison, one of the fathers of our Constitution, and continue to say we don't want aid to churches.

WALL -- and Justice Thomas, I think, walks through the history of the opposite in his Rosenberger concurrence, that at the time of the founding, when they gave out land in the Northwest Territory and other statutes for -- to schools, they included religiously affiliated schools. I think actually the tradition that dates to the founding is -- is sort of the opposite, that you can't disqualify them just based on their religious character, but you can have no compelled support, no preferential aid to the church.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Wall, I mean, there seems -- I was one of the seven in Trinity Lutheran, but there seems to me a real difference in this case.   In Trinity Lutheran, the -- a state was using the religious status of various people or entities to limit access to a unrelated public benefit, to a completely secular public benefit. Now, here, it seems to me, that what the state is doing with respect to these educational programs is to say: We don't want to subsidize religious activity.   We don't want to subsidize religious education.   And, further, because of the way that the supreme court issued its decision, that will mean that we don't want to subsidize any private education. So you have both the non-discrimination as to that, but even put that aside, what this is is essentially a state saying, for many reasons that have been viewed as legitimate, even though not shared by everybody, but have been viewed as legitimate for many years, we don't want to subsidize religious activity, in particular religious education.   That's a far cry from Trinity Lutheran. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey B. Wall", "text": " So your question gets at the two things I was hoping to say before I sat down. The -- the first is all we're asking and the Petitioners are asking is that you do what you normally do when you review a state supreme court decision.   At page 32 of the Pet. App., it said no problem with federal law.   It got federal law wrong.   If it had come out correctly on the federal law question, nothing else in the decision would have flowed.   The trial court would have been affirmed and everybody would have gotten the scholarships. That -- with the application of the state constitutional provision, which was preempted under Trinity Lutheran, was the only basis to impugn the state law.   So you should reverse the federal error and send it back. On the merits of your question, look, I get that you can say it's a harder case because it's -- it's education and it's not a playground.   And in that sense, it may be a harder question, but the Montana Supreme Court didn't take it as a case about use, didn't try to say this was covered by Davey or any of the rest. It said religiously-affiliated schools.   That's a status-based distinction. And I don't think we can distinguish that from Trinity Lutheran. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky. "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution does not bar the State of Montana from enacting and applying a state constitutional provision that keeps its own state legislature out of the business of funding of religious schools. The no-aid clause does not prohibit anyone's free exercise of religion.   To the contrary, it protects religious freedom by protecting religious schools from government influence and ensuring that government cannot use aid as leverage to influence the content of religious education. Petitioners attempt to analogize this case to Trinity Lutheran but the analogy is inapt for two reasons: The first reason is that the coercion aspect of Trinity Lutheran, which was crucial to the Court's decision, was absent here.   In Trinity Lutheran, the church put to a stark choice: Either abandon your religious faith and become a nice secular stone building with a daycare facility and you're going to get the money or stick to your religious faith and you won't get -- you won't get the money. And that coercion was the premise of the Court's decision that there is a penalty on free exercise.   That's not happening in this case where the state court held that Montana wasn't even capable of knowing whether a particular parent would use money for a religious and non-religious school, and it therefore held that regardless of how the money was spent, there wouldn't be a tax credit. The second distinction from Trinity Lutheran is that Trinity Lutheran involved the refusal to give money to a church for a completely non-religious purpose, merely because it was a church.   This case is different in that the state is simply declining to fund religious education. The state court did not hold that under the no-aid clause, religious schools would be denied funding for non-religious purposes. So let me start with the standing point which came up during the first half hour. So we didn't, as the Court knows, it's in an amicus brief, but we didn't make the argument in our brief because we concluded that the arguments really went more to the merits rather than standing. We -- I -- I mean, we believe there's an attenuated connection between the state action here and Petitioners' free exercise of religion but Petitioners are alleging in their brief that they personally are the victims of status discrimination because they are Christians. We think that's wrong based on what the state court actually did, but historically the courthouse doors have been open to make that kind of argument.   But we think on the merits, there simply isn't a prohibition on the free exercise. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And, you know, the first half of the argument involved a number of questions about how Petitioners are really harmed if the program as a whole is struck down. And I think I heard two sets of arguments from the other side, from Petitioners, both of which I would like to address.   One argument is the sort of broader argument that just, the no-aid clause is just constitutionally defective, like, by its very nature, because it is discriminatory, is not capable of being applied, and, therefore, the court should just remand and tell the court you just can't apply this illegal rule. And the second argument I heard is this somewhat narrower argument that as applied, the problem here is that the court excluded religious schools from a general program as in Trinity Lutheran. So if I could just address those -- those two theories of the case by Petitioners. So I think the first argument really is tantamount to an argument that the no-aid clause is facially unconstitutional, because like every single time you applied the no-aid clause, the rule it recites is that religious schools don't get money because -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

So if -- if that's the case, and I -- I agree that that's the tenor of Petitioners' argument.   I think the government was making a broader argument but I think Petitioners' argument is more limited. So if -- if it is the case that in general the Court -- the state court can apply the no-aid clause, in other words, it's not just facially discriminatory to say because something is religious -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

In the lower court, it wasn't the no-aid clause that was really being challenged; it was the rule.

I just don't think the state court had the chance to do that here because the argument wasn't really raised.

So if you accept the premise that Rule 1 is unconstitutional because it discriminates, it says secular schools in and religious schools out, that doesn't answer the question of whether the mere application of a no-aid clause that does not lead to a judgment with that effect is also unconstitutional.

"}, {"speaker": "Adam G.

You might think that funding religion creates divisiveness and conflict within a society, and that for all those reasons, funding religious activity is not a good idea and that you would rather level down and fund no comparable activity, whether religious or otherwise, than fund both.

And -- and I don't think the rule is the same in religion.   But later this term, this Court's about to hear a case involving exemptions of religious schools from anti- discrimination laws.

That's the point.   They -- the state -- nobody's claiming the state has an obligation to make particular grants to religious institutions or to provide any funding for private education at all. The question is, can they -- if -- if -- if there is a program that is -- that's -- is designed to serve certain purposes, can they discriminate in the application of the -- in the -- in the -- deciding who's going to get the benefit of it on the basis of religious affiliation?

I think what state -- there are certain things a state can't do and certain things a state can do.

Now, we're constrained by anti-discrimination principles from coercing people into abandoning their religion.   So if we have these two principles, these principled non-bigoted and historically rooted views that we don't want to fund religious activity on the one hand, and the First Amendment, which clearly guards against coercion and penalizing religious faith on the other, the way we're going to balance it is to do what the state court did.

And in 1972, what the delegates basically said was that they conceived of the no-aid clause as a mechanism of protecting religious schools from political influence.   So, to prevent government from using its leverage to -- to influence the content of religious education.

One way of looking at discrimination is to say that just -- you can't have a rule that treats religion differently from other subjects, which is I think is the core of Petitioners' argument. And they say, look at the no-aid clause.   It says religious schools are ineligible and it imposes no comparable restriction on anyone else, and therefore that's just discrimination and it should be wiped out of the state constitution. So if -- if -- if you buy that argument, then you're basically saying that like every no-aid clause since 1835 is unconstitutional, even at the founding.   Look, all the state constitutions said things like, a tax won't be levied to build a church.   That is a form of discrimination, right? Like you can levy a tax to build a bridge but not a church. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I -- I mean, I don't know about every -- every no-aid clause in the country.   They'd all have to be examined separately if in -- if, in fact, they are challenged. A lot of them -- look, you -- I'm not going to get into an argument with you about what happened in 1972, but do you really want to argue that the reason why a lot of this popped up beginning, coincidentally, in the 1840s, at the time of the Irish potato famine, that had nothing to do with discrimination based on religion? "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " I'm not saying that they -- no, I'm not saying that at all.   I think that the history in the 19th century is very complex, like there's a Professor Green, who is a leading scholar on this, wrote a book that both parties cite which basically says it's a complex history and there's good reasons and there's bad reasons and it depends on the state. And, look, I -- I don't see how Montana could -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But aren't you saying -- are you -- I don't know, can we -- can you or could I say this: Yes, race is different from religion.   Why? There is no Establishment Clause in regard to race. What is the Establishment Clause? Well, it has something to do with not supporting religion.   And there is nothing more religious except perhaps for the service in the church itself than religious education.   That's how we create a future for our religion. Now, there's some line there, and that line may be what I have just suggested, impermissible under case law of this Court or it may be permissible but unwise.   You'd like to draw the line.   Explain it. "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " Okay.   So I think that, you know, we haven't talked about the analogies to Locke at all.   I'd just like to say a few words about that, with I -- which I think are consistent to your question. So it's true that there are factual distinctions between this case and Locke, right? Locke involved training for the ministry and this case involves secondary education. So I'm -- I'm not denying -- I'm not saying they're on all fours with each other, but the question is whether that distinction can be located in the free-exercise clause. Because, really, you know, it's true that Locke involved funding of the ministry but I think this case does too, right, the ministry of teachers towards their students.   And I think Petitioners have a somewhat revealing statement -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But this is a -- this is a school, in education, there satisfies the compulsory education laws of the state, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " That's true. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And so that's different from Locke, as Professor Laycock's amicus brief points out in a very narrow decision about training of the clergy. And it seems to me there are two different things going on here, it seems to me. One is to Justice Breyer's question, just funding religion, funding religious schools generally or training of clergy is -- is an establishment clause concern, but this -- it's a separate issue when you set up a neutral benefit program -- police, fire, or scholarships -- and allow people to use those things, allow religious institutions to obtain the benefits of those things on a non-discriminatory basis. And the question in this case, it seems to me, is which side of that line this comes on.   Is that the -- a proper way to look at it? And if so, why does it come on the funding side? "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " I -- I guess I'm not really sure that's the right way to look at it. I think that it's important to just look at the interest the no-aid clause protects, understand whether those are just unconstitutional and whether they apply to this case. So as I said, the no-aid clause was concerned about using government leverage to influence religious education.   And it's very easy how -- to see how that can happen in the context of even a neutral program like this one. The state can just have a condition -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " You think that was the design of the no-aid clause, to -- to help religious institutions? "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " Yeah.   If you look at the transcripts of 1972, that's -- is -- what it is all about.   There -- there is numerous religious leaders who came forward and testified that that's the reason they wanted it.   On the floor of the convention in 1972, the strongest proponent was Delegate Harper who was not an anti-religious bigot.   He was the pastor of a church in Helena and he told his colleagues, drawing on his own religious faith, that the no-aid clause was necessary to ensure that religious schools were independent from government. So I just don't -- and there's a committee report -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, no one's compelling the religious schools to participate in a program in order to accept funds from the program, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " That is certainly true.   But -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " So a religious school that doesn't want to be part of a neutral program doesn't have to be. "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " Yeah, that's true. But I mean, there's still a concern that ultimately the inevitable effect of these programs is that the government would exercise its leverage over schools. And, look, this is what people were saying at the hearing, and I think that may be a little paternalistic, but I think the state is allowed to have a structural provision being arguably paternalistic in its own state constitution. There's no bigotry whatsoever in evidence from the actual convention at which this is enacted.   I just don't understand how Montana could have done any better than it did, to wipe out its entire state constitution, start all over again, have committee hearings -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " I think the other side's argument is the way you can do better is to say: If we're going to give benefits to private schools, which you don't have to do -- to Justice Breyer's question, you do not have to give benefits to private schools or funds or tax credits, but if you do, don't tell someone they can't participate because they're Jewish or Protestant or Catholic. "}, {"speaker": "Adam G. Unikowsky", "text": " I guess the -- the concern of the delegates was that if you have money going to religious schools, that's going to lead to entanglement problems.   And the way to solve that problem is to have a structural provision saying, we're not going to do it. And that's not prohibiting anyone from exercising their religion.   It's simply separating the church from the state without, again, preventing anyone from going to any of these schools if they don't want to. And it's true that there's a constraint in the Federal Constitution that says that you can't coerce people, you can't tell people we're going to penalize you for being religious.   But if a state has two principles it wants to stick to at the same time then we think that it should be able to balance those principles by invalidating the program.

You are not at liberty to waive Article III, so why do you think this case doesn't fit under Eastern Kentucky? "}, {"speaker": "Adam G.

Unikowsky", "text": " So Petitioners are claiming they personally are the victims of status discrimination, which is the argument that wasn't made in that case.   So we think that they're allowed to make that argument, it is just incorrect on its merits. But, of course, this argument is made in amicus brief.   And, as you say, we're not able to waive it.

What we're saying here is that -- what Trinity Lutheran says, the state can't discriminate on the basis of religion.   The decision is crystal clear when you read it that that is what they are doing in this case. They focus on the religious affiliation or religious nature of the schools. They are not talking about what the schools do. They are talking about what the schools are. Second, Zelman has already answered the question about who this program is aiding. It's not aiding the schools.   It is aiding the parents. You have a choice to make about the parents here.   You can either view them as mere inconsequential conduits through which public funds flow to the religious schools they choose or you can regard them, as you did in Zelman, as free and independent decision-makers who are being given the power to choose a religious education or a secular education in private schools. We are not arguing that the state couldn't just fund public schools.   We are saying that when the legislature, when the state makes the decision to empower parents to exercise their right to choose and direct their children's education, that the state cannot distinguish between parents who want a religious education for their children and parents who want a secular private education for their parents. We are only in that area because the state legislature has made, like Montana did, the decision to open it up beyond the public schools.   We don't question that the public schools must be secular.   This Court recognized that in Schempp.   And, as a result, the public schools now must be secular. But at the time these provisions were passed, the public schools were not secular.
