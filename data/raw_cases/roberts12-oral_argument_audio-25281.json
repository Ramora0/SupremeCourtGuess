[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 20-543, Yellen versus the Confederated Tribes, and the consolidated case. Mr. Guarnieri. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our fundamental submission in this case is that in defining \"Indian Tribe\" for ISDA purposes, Congress did not deliberately include Alaska native regional and village corporations only to then exclude all of them by subjecting them to a formal political recognition requirement that no ANC meets or, indeed, has ever met. Instead, the settled understanding for the last 45 years has been that ANCs are eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA purposes, even though ANCs are not and have never been federally recognized Indian Tribes. That interpretation has been endorsed by all three branches of the federal government. Congress was acting against the backdrop of those settled understandings when it incorporated the ISDA definition of \"Indian Tribe\" into the CARES Act in 2020.   Congress chose to make ANCs eligible to receive millions of dollars of coronavirus relief funds to benefit the many Alaska natives whom they serve. The decision below contravenes that policy judgment and threatens to shut ANCs out of a wide range of important federal programs. No sound principle of textual interpretation justifies such a dramatic departure from the status quo.   Reading the ISDA definition to mean that ANCs are included only in the event that they are someday somehow recognized by the United States for government-to-government relations would render their deliberate inclusion in the statute a dead letter.   Either the recognition clause must mean something else, or it does not apply to ANCs. Now we principally urge the latter approach, which the Department of the Interior and the Indian Health Service adopted decades ago and which the Ninth Circuit endorsed in the Cook Inlet case. In our view, Congress defined the entities eligible to enter into ISDA agreements as federally recognized Indian Tribes and also, in addition, the entities that play a similar role in the special case of Alaska, namely, Alaska native villages and Alaska native corporations defined in and established pursuant to ANCSA.   That reading, unlike Respondents' reading, gives effect to every word and clause in the statute. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, as I think you confirmed in this opening statement, you rely heavily on the legislative history, the congressional purpose, the post-enactment history, and there was a time when this Court also relied on those sources, but this -- this is not that time. And what is the best case you can cite from recent years for your -- your general approach? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, I think the case that -- that we find the most instructive is the Court's decision against -- in United States against Hayes, which is the case discussed in our opening brief.   In Hayes, the Court was considering a statutory definition of the term \"misdemeanor\" -- \"domestic misdemeanor violence\" -- or, sorry, \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\" and the -- the statutory definition there had a prefatory clause and then two subsections, and the question before the Court was how to apply a modifier in the second subsection. And based on textual and contextual evidence, the Court concluded that the modifier that appeared in the second subclause of that definition actually applied to its -- its antecedent was one of the words in the prefatory clause at the beginning of the definition. And we think we're asking the Court here for -- for an even less sort of -- the interpretation that we're urging here is even more naturally sort of derived from the text than the interpretation the Court adopted in Hayes. And also, you know, to your -- to your point, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, we are making a textual argument.   It's not entirely purposive.   And -- and it's a text -- it's a textual argument derived from ISDA's definition, as well as from the other statutes that Congress has enacted that in their text presuppose that ANCs are eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, would you give us again -- would you repeat -- maybe I missed it -- your -- your textual argument again? It seems like the -- there -- it seems -- I don't know how you cannot have the -- the -- the phrase or clause at the end modifying the entire list. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, Justice Thomas, the -- the textual argument is that if -- if you look at -- the definition of ISDA should not be read to include ANCs in a -- in -- Congress did not deliberately and specifically refer to Alaska native village and regional corporations established pursuant to a then-recent federal law only to exclude them in the very next clause.   We don't think the statute should be read to be at war with itself.   And the -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Yeah, but what do you do with the recognized language? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, we think that that clause, as the Interior Department concluded in 1976 shortly after ISDA was enacted, we think that clause is simply inapplicable to the entities listed in the Alaska clause and that that's really the -- the only reading or the reading of the statute that would avoid the glaring super -- super-fluidity problem that the D.C. Circuit's reading created. And, of course, as an -- as an alternative, we have also advanced in this Court the argument that, if you understand the recognition clause to apply to the entities listed in the Alaska clause, then recognition cannot refer exclusively to formal federal recognition for government-to-government relations but must also include the lesser form of recognition that Congress itself bestowed upon ANCs by including them in the ISDA definition. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " In the subsequent funding bills, has Congress, with this -- recognizing that there's been this litigation, has Congress used different language? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Congress has gone both ways on that issue, Justice Thomas.   I mean, in -- in the law that Congress enacted, I -- I assume your -- your question is about the recent coronavirus legislation? "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, in -- in the law that Congress enacted in December of 2020, Congress provided funds for housing programs under a preexisting federal statute that incorporates, in part, the ISDA language.   And Congress included a proviso there saying that, for -- for the avoidance of doubt, that definition includes ANCs. Now, in the most recent law, the America Rescue Plan Act, Congress provided additional funds, coronavirus relief funds to state and local governments and to tribal governments using the List Act definition, which excludes ANCs.   So Congress determined not to include ANCs in that program. And, of course, Congress could have done that in the CARES Act.   It could have reached for the List Act definition, which everyone understands does not include ANCs, but Congress instead used the -- the ISDA definition, which has been uniformly understood for decades to make ANCs eligible.

I think there's the amicus brief filed by Cook Inlet Region Incorporated, which is the regional ANC covering the Alaska area, goes into that in some detail.

"}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   I -- I see that.   What's actually bothering me here is I gather there are roughly 150 statutes that definitionally refer to the -- the -- the language -- refer to the statute at issue here, the ISDA, that's the -- that's the statute, right, that has the definition.   Okay. I don't know what's in that 150 statutes.   I suspect that some of them it makes sense to apply to the corporations, the Alaska Indian -- the corporations, and some it doesn't. So I have a very hard time -- have you been through those? Do we know that the view that the -- you're -- you're taking now is -- is -- is going to work in all those 150 statutes?

"}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " And I -- I agree that the ISDA definition is quite frequently -- it quite frequently appears in the U.S. code, either by cross-reference or -- or by Congress having used the same language. Now, as we discuss at pages 33 to 34 of our opening brief, there are statutes in which there are other textual and contextual clues that indicate that either ANCs are not included for other reasons or ANCs -- that the programs are sort of inapplicable to ANCs.

"}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Guarnieri, I -- I think you have an absurdity argument, and I'll ask Respondents' counsel about that. But, if you can't prevail on that basis, I can see one textual argument that could possibly work for you, and you make it only in passing, and that is that the clause \"which is recognized as eligible\" doesn't mean formal recognition in the sense in which Indian Tribes are recognized. Do you have any other textual argument? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, yes, Justice Alito.   I mean, our -- our -- well, first, we would accept a decision by that court on that alternative ground, but, I mean, as to our principal argument, I think the textual argument is that the word \"including\" here functions as a term of enlargement rather than to denote a subset of -- of the specified entities -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah.   No, I -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " -- as I think Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- I -- I understand that point.   I -- I think that's -- that's possible.   I don't see how it helps you, because you still have a clause modifying a list, and you want it to jump over the last item in the list.   That's really odd, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " I -- I take the point. Let -- let me try a plain English example to illustrate how -- how we think the ISDA definition works here. I mean, suppose a state were to prioritize for vaccinations all doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers, including their spouses and minor children, whose jobs require frequent contact with the public. Now I think, in context, one would naturally understand that the final clause in that, the clause referring to jobs requiring frequent -- frequent contact with the public, really only modifies and in context can only be understood to modify the doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers who appear in the list at the beginning. And then there's just an including clause stuck in the middle there, in perhaps not the most elegant place, but in a place that makes clear that the intent is to expand that category of, you know, front-line workers to also include their families and minor children. And that's what Congress did in the ISDA definition.   Congress -- so Congress in -- the -- the -- the definition is best read to refer to federally recognized Indian Tribes and then also including in addition the specific Alaska native village and region -- regional corporations that Congress singled out for inclusion in an Alaska-specific clause. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Well, that's very close to what I refer to as the absurdity argument. If we were to take the other possible textual approach and say that \"recognize\" doesn't mean formal recognition, what effect would that have in other statutes that use this same definition? Would you be willing to accept that, or do you want -- would you want us to say this is what it means only in the CARES Act and not in the other statutes in which the same definition is used? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, Justice Alito, I -- I think our alternative argument is a little -- slightly different.   I mean, I think we would say that \"recognition\" -- on the alternative argument, \"recognition\" doesn't refer exclusively to federal recognition for government-to-government relations but can also refer to the lesser status that Congress conferred on ANCs. And -- and there's a reason I would emphasize that distinction, and -- and it's that, you know, I mean, ISDA contracting is not entirely discretionary, and so we do have some concern that other organized groups of Indians who are not federally recognized Indian Tribes would be coming in and demanding that the Interior Department engage in ISDA contracting with them -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Thank you, counsel.   My time is up. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, I -- I'm a bit concerned, the way Justice Breyer is, about what our ruling would mean here, and it's consistent, in part, with what Justice Alito has just asked you, which is how do we rule in a narrow way that affects only the CARES Act and not the many other acts that are involved for ISDA mentioned the Johnson-O'Malley Act, the Snyder Act, which I think is now the Indian Health Improvement Act, and the Transfer Act? But I'm also understanding, I believe -- and you can confirm or disaffirm -- that there are many other housing assistance, healthcare, and social service to thousands of Alaska natives each year by the ANCs. Would our -- if we were to accept Respondents' position and the D.C. Circuit's holding below that ISDA does not -- cannot include anyone but federally recognized tribes, would we be putting at risk all of those other services? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, yes, Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And, if so, is the federal government prepared to step in and provide those services? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, I -- I -- that -- that's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor.   A decision affirming the D.C. Circuit here and adopting Respondents' construction would call into question the treatment of ANCs under numerous other federal laws that currently provide important federal benefits to Alaska natives, including housing assistance and energy assistance. And, you know, to -- to your broader point, Justice Sotomayor, I mean, the -- the -- the interpretation that we are propounding here is the interpretation that has prevailed for 45 years and that was the backdrop for Congress's enactment of numerous other programs incorporating the ISDA language.   And so a decision in Respondents' favor would threaten to really -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " -- seriously disrupt the intent of the clause. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So, counsel, give us the narrowest ruling that would let Respondents win and not put those contracts at risk. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Well, of course, Justice Sotomayor, we -- we think that Respondents should not win.   I mean, we're here principally defending that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I -- I -- I respect that, counsel.   I'm asking you to tell me -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Sure, sure.   I -- I -- I take the point.   Well, as between the -- the arguments offered on the other side, a decision finding that ANCs are excluded from receiving CARES Act funds by some specific language in the CARES Act, for example, the definition of a tribal government in the CARES Act, would mean that ANCs are ineligible to receive these particular CARES Act funds but would not necessarily call into their -- question their eligibility to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA purposes under the broader corpus of Indian laws.   So, certainly, a CARES Act-specific decision would be a much more narrower ground. The D.C. Circuit here really decided the case on the broadest possible ground.   I mean, in the CARES Act dispute, the D.C. Circuit concluded that ANCs have never been eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA purposes, despite decades of practice to the contrary.

ANCs would have resembled tribes in that they owned land. I mean, we just have sort of different groups here, and why might Congress not have thought, well, we'll see how it all plays out and maybe one day, given the -- the circumstances of Alaska, these groups will be recognized? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Justice Kagan, the -- the principal consideration going the other way is that for 180 years, one of the core elements of the United States' Indian law has -- has been the idea that Indian Tribes are possessed of an inherent sovereignty, a sovereignty that is not conferred on them by federal or state law. And that is simply not true for ANCs, and it has never been true, and it would have been apparent to the Congress at the time it enacted ISDA that it was not true.   ANCs were established pursuant to a special federal law. They are incorporated under state law.   And they are not sovereign entities.   And -- and that was evident to everyone at the time.

So you -- you told several of my colleagues that the recognition clause -- that one way to understand it is that it's a term of art but that it has a -- well, that you could take its ordinary meaning, simply, you know, an entity that contracts with the federal government for services that are designed to go to Indians because of their status as Indians. And you said, well, sure, you can look at this, and I understand it's your backup argument, but you can understand it in its ordinary meaning as the other Petitioner advocates for. Now you say but a lesser-included definition would be the term-of-art recognition definition like we see in the later-passed List Act. I don't really see how you can have a -- a lesser included specialized definition.   It seems to me either it's ordinary meaning or it's not.   And, you know, you're kind of cagey in your brief and I think a little bit at oral argument too about whether, in fact, that eligibility clause refers to FRT status. So which is it?

I mean, we think that that clause can be reasonably read to refer to having a requisite status under federal law, and then it just applies -- you know, different entities would be able to satisfy that requirement in different ways. For the ANCs, Congress deemed them to satisfy it by specifically including them among the entities that are eligible to enter into ISDA agreements. For the generic terms listed at the beginning of this statute, that is, any Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, I mean, the established way for those -- those groups to demonstrate that they have the requisite status is to be acknowledged for government-to-government relations with the United States.

That sounds like you're folding back into your argument about, well, specific mention of the Alaskan entities would have not made any sense if the eligibility clause was designed to apply to them because ANCs by their very composition have -- you know, they were designed to channel money from the federal government to their shareholders, and so they had that status from the beginning. So what I'm asking you is a little bit different because, if the ordinary meaning, say, of that eligibility clause prevails, then we don't have to -- we could rule in your favor without doing this kind of fancy footwork around the awkward grammatical reading of the statute.

Now our principal argument is that that if \"recognition\" is understood as a term of art, then the clause should not apply to ANCs, but we would accept a decision under which \"recognition\" is given a somewhat more capacious meaning, and -- and the ANCs satisfy that. Second, I just want to emphasize again that the question presented here arises under the CARES Act, which Congress enacted in 2020, and by that time, there can be no real question that the ISDA definition was uniformly understood to include ANCs, even though they are not federally recognized Indian Tribes. That was the administrative construction, it was the Ninth Circuit's construction in the Cook Inlet case, the construction articulated in all of the leading treatises in this area.   That's the meaning Congress incorporated, and that's the meaning we ask this Court to endorse. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Nearly everything about Alaska is different, including its native entities. Congress established ANCs in the Settlement Act as native entities unlike lower 48 tribes.   ANCs have never been sovereign, but they have always played a critical role in distributing special federal Indian benefits to Alaska natives. Congress specifically added ANCs to ISDEAA's definition of \"Indian Tribes.\" Respondents, however, contend that Congress accomplished nothing because ANCs do not satisfy the eligibility clause. But, if that clause is only given its ordinary meaning, ANCs plainly satisfy it. Congress said \"recognized as eligible,\" not \"recognized as sovereigns,\" and ANCs have long been recognized as eligible for special federal Indian benefits starting with the Settlement Act. If, instead, the phrase is given a term-of-art meaning restricted to sovereign tribes, then it is wholly inapplicable to entities established by Congress as alternatives to sovereign tribes. Either reading is vastly preferable to one that would defeat the ANCs' specific inclusion in the definition. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. In your brief, you compare this statute to the case of a caretaker being told to feed the cats, the dogs, and goldfish, which are barking, and -- but the force of that analogy comes from the fact that it's impossible for the goldfish to bark. In this case, though, Congress has the authority, right, to formally recognize the ANCs? And so doesn't that undermine your analogy? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I don't think so, Your Honor, because you're right to say that Congress could, in a subsequent act, recognize the ANCs, but that would be a complete departure both from the nature of ANCs and the nature of sovereign recognition.

And if you look at just the Anchorage area alone, you're talking about 54,000 Alaska natives who get benefits from CIRI who are not a member of one of the Anchorage area villages, which aren't actually in Anchorage.   They're just in the surrounding region. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " All right.

And, more generally, the federal government has found a way to make this work because what you really do is you do have identifiable native populations not just in Anchorage but in Fairbanks, in Seward, and Valdez who are not served by any village but are served by the regional ANC, and those Alaska natives will go radically underserved if the ANCs are cut out of the statute.

If -- there -- there are a couple of statutes, and Respondents point to them, that seem to include the ANCs in the statute that is otherwise addressed to some sovereign function that the ANCs really don't discharge, and that modest degree of overinclusion is really harmless error because they just don't participate in the program. Conversely, there are plenty of statutes that embody the ISDA definition and are -- plainly involve ANCs and have since their inception.   And as the federal government points out in its brief, just in fiscal year 2020 alone, the ANCs received $40 million in housing assistance pursuant to NAHASDA, which basically incorporates the definition from ISDEAA. So I think the impact on other statutes is completely asymmetrical.   If the ANCs fall out because they don't provide a particular program, no harm, no foul. If, instead, they're cut out of programs they participated in for decades, there are going to be tens of thousands of Alaska natives who don't get benefits that Congress plainly intended that they would receive not just in the abstract but through ANC.

I think, as you can see from this morning's argument, though, that probably the principal difference is I want to leap to the ordinary language argument, and my friend from the government seems to only want to get -- sort of edge there. But, you know, I don't think the other side can really have it both ways.   You're either a textualist or you're not.   And if you're a textualist, why wouldn't you apply the plain meaning of \"recognized as eligible\"? Congress said \"recognized as eligible,\" not \"recognized as sovereign.\" Those may be interchangeable in the lower 48, but they're very different terms in Alaska.   And that all goes back to the Settlement Act. Congress didn't want to replicate the lower 48 of sovereign tribes more to reservations when they distributed the benefits of the land settlement, so they created these new entities that were distinctly native entities that caused every Alaska native to enroll in one of the regional ANCs.   They didn't require them to enroll in a village. And then, four years later, Congress said, in a process of furthering self-determination, we want to include the ANCs. It would be bizarre to cut them out on the understanding that what Congress really wanted is not to have ANCs play a role in self-determination but only allow sovereign entities to play a role in self-determination when Congress just rejected that judgment in Alaska.

And since ANCs are ISDEAA tribes and they clearly have recognized governing bodies, there really isn't any statutory problem there. And if it helps, I would point you to two other statutes, 40 U.S.C. 502(c)(3), 44 U.S.C. 3601(8), which are statutes that have a statutory term of \"tribal government\" and expressly include ANCs in the definition of \"tribal government.\" Somewhat ironically, they include ANCs but not the villages in a definition that is specifically directed to tribal governments.   So the CARES Act would not be alone in including ANCs in a definition of \"tribal governments.\" "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Clement", "text": " So, Justice Kagan, I think ANCs became recognized as eligible in 1971 in the Settlement Act because, if you understand that the Settlement Act is distributing the benefits from an aboriginal land settlement, the traditional thing you would do in that circumstance in the lower 48 is you would give the proceeds to a tribe. But Congress in 1971 understood that Alaska didn't have tribes and reservations the way they did in the lower 48, so they specifically created these entities, the ANCs, to receive the proceeds of the settlement, which I would understand to be special federal Indian benefits, and importantly -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.

Clement", "text": " So two things, Your Honor. First of all, they were aboriginal land claims, so right there you know these are distinct native entities to receive distinctly native benefits. But then the second point I would make -- and I think this is important to understand -- is Alaska natives were eligible in general for special federal Indian benefits even before the Settlement Act through the Snyder Act. And the Snyder Act is one of the acts that is empowered for self-determination under ISDEAA.   So, in a sense, this all works perfectly together.   Having just created distinct native entities that every Alaska native was a member of one of the regional ANCs, then Congress in 1975 includes those entities in a statute that's all about self-determination with respect to funds that Alaska natives had already all along, even before 1971, been eligible for.

It seems to me that the government is a little nervous about moving off of recognition in its formal sense because it's concerned about self-identifying groups declaring their eligibility for a lot of federal programs. And you're a little less concerned about that, understandably, but there are a couple of -- a couple of terms there that just I -- I struggle with. To the extent we're defining a tribal government for the CARES Act, isn't that an odd fit for a corporate board? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D.

And, you know, various Indian Tribes -- and you probably know this better than I do -- are organized in various different ways.   I'm sure there are lower 48 tribes that have some kind of corporate -- incorporation and some kind of board. So it's not like you can't have a native entity that is governed by a board of directors, which is a very common, ordinary way of referring to it.   And as I alluded to in answering Justice Sotomayor's questions, there's at least two other statutes that specifically include ANCs -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Are -- are -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D.

"}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, two things, Your Honor.   There hasn't been that much alienation, and anybody who's not a native doesn't get a voting share.   They just get a share. But, with that minor clarification, obviously, that sort of \"special federal Indian benefits for Indians\" is -- is -- is a bit of an odd phrase not just, I think, as to ANCs but to any group because it really seems to be talking about the benefits that the Alaska natives or the lower 48 natives themselves are eligible because of their status as Indian. But, to the extent entities have a status, nobody doubts that ANCs have a native status, and I think the fact that the real point of the Self-Determination Act is to take natives who are eligible for special federal Indian benefits and instead of having the federal government provide those directly, you have a tribal entity do that. And in Alaska, the ANCs have been doing that for 45 years, and it's been working exceptionally well.   So there's no basis to disturb that. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Thank you.

I just want to explore briefly your understanding of the term-of-art canon. Is it your understanding, I think, from what you're saying that the canon is something of an exception to ordinary meaning?

"}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And what's your best argument for why \"recognized as eligible\" as ordinary meaning supports your position? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I think it's a pretty straightforward argument, Your Honor.   I mean, eligibility is not the same as sovereignty.   If Congress wanted everything to turn on sovereignty, it would have said \"recognized as sovereign\" or it might have even said \"eligible via recognition.\" But it didn't use any of those terms. And one other point I'd like to emphasize is that the term-of-art argument is much weaker in 1975 than it was in -- after the List Act in 1994.   In 1975, as the government's lawyer suggested, \"recognition\" is not the well-established term of art that it is.   In fact, in 1975, the federal government's recognition process was kind of a mess. And when they tried to regularize it a little bit in 1978 with their first regulations, even those regulations talked about acknowledgment.   And even today, the -- the federal government has an Office of Tribal Acknowledgment, not an office of tribal recognition.   It's really not until 1994 in the List Act that you can really see \"recognized as eligible\" as being a term of art, and even then, it's really only a term of art for the lower 48. So making it a low -- a term of art back in 1975 that applies to Alaska that would have the effect of frustrating the inclusion of the Alaska clause really doesn't make any sense.

Clement", "text": " Well, they're not, Your Honor, because, if you go into the details of the List Act and you go and look at the note to the definition, it's very clear that what Congress was trying to do in the List Act was to essentially force the Interior Department to formalize its process for sovereign recognition.

I wonder what -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " I mean, I understand that, but doesn't Congress's use of that phrase in the List Act undercut your argument that eligibility isn't about sovereignty? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " No, I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think, again, for two reasons. One is the language is not exactly identical because it -- whenever Congress has talked about \"recognition\" as meaning only sovereignty in subsequent years after 1990 -- rather, 1975, they specifically tethered it to recognition by the Secretary, and I think that brings in the entirety of the -- the -- the process for recognition and its sovereign requirements. And if you go back to 1975, the idea that when Congress was trying to promote self-determination in Alaska, it was going to hinge that on whether the Alaska entities were sovereign doesn't make any sense.   Even as to the villages, it took 18 years to figure out whether the villages were sovereign.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " I mean, I can see that, but it's kind of at war with the -- the plain meaning of the text if it's understood to be a term of art.   And, I mean, I take your point that maybe it wasn't a term of art when ISDA was enacted but became so later, particularly after the List Act. But can you think of any other instance in statutory interpretation where something has had its ordinary meaning in the beginning and then gained a term of art where then you interpret statutes differently depending on where they fell along the continuum of that process? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " It seems to me -- I -- I can't point you to that, but I would say two things.   One is, if a term only becomes a term of art later, let's say 1994, I don't think you would import it backwards to a -- a -- a statute that was enacted earlier. And I still don't think even in 1994 that \"recognized\" as it's used in ISDEAA is a term of art.   And the best evidence of that is NAHASDA, which was passed one year later in 1995, and it basically mimics the ISDEAA language, and it has been interpreted from day one to include the ANCs, and they got $40 million of funding under it last year.

In the end, whether the eligibility clause has an ordinary meaning that ANCs satisfy or a term-of-art meaning that is wholly inapplicable to them, there is no cause for interpreting ISDEAA or the CARES Act to exclude ANCs and the natives they serve. Alaska natives were eligible for special federal Indian benefits long before the Settlement Act in ISDEAA.   Nothing in either statute terminated those benefits or made them turn on membership in a sovereign tribe. To the contrary, the Settlement Act told every Alaska native to enroll not in a village but in a regional ANC.   As a direct result of that congressional decision, there are tens of thousands of Alaska natives whose only native affiliation is with an ANC. Cutting ANCs out of ISDEAA's definition would leave those Alaska natives out in the cold.   Cutting out ANCs would also destroy Alaska's self-determination success story that depends on cooperation between ANCs and sovereign villages. In short, Alaska is different and Alaska is working.

Rasmussen", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A unanimous panel of the D.C. Circuit had no difficulty concluding that ANCs do not qualify as Indian Tribes under ISDEAA and -- and thus under the CARES Act.   As the court of appeals explained, under basic English sentence construction, the recognition clause unambiguously applies to each of the nouns that precedes it, including each ANC.   And by referring to groups recognized as eligible for the special programs available to Indians, the recognition clause plainly refers to the formal recognition -- recognized status. Indeed, the U.S. agreed with that until this case reached this Court.   Petitioners contend that the court of appeals' interpretation would render this statute's inclusion of ANCs super -- superfluous. This is wrong for two reasons. First, the cardinal rule is the plain meaning, and the English language construction of the sentence is simple and clear. Second, as Petitioners do not even contest, the political branches could, both in 1975 and today, have believed that their plenary authority allowed them to recognize ANCs. Therefore, there is no super -- superfluity problem. Nor is the court of appeals' interpretation absurd because the Court could -- or the Congress could reasonably believe, when enacting ISDA, that ANCs might be recognized in the future. Petitioners also invoke their doctrine of ratification.   That is wrong for three reasons, the primary one being simply that it -- that doctrine does not trump the plain meaning. The ANCs warn that, left standing, the court of appeals' decision will deprive Alaska natives of much-needed services and benefits. In actuality, the opposite is true.   Alaska native villages provide those benefits to Alaska natives, and the primary example of an ANC doing so, which is CIRI, is authorized by an independent statute.

And my question is, why doesn't that text undermine the plain language argument? In other words, we're not talking about some overriding purpose.   We're not talking about legislative history. What we're talking about is the text, and the text says in the list ANCs.   And then the text takes away eligibility.

We have from 1971 until 1993 before it became clear. And so there wasn't that -- that certainty.   And, certainly, when Congress was enacting the ISDEAA, it did not know.   And when Congress doesn't know, this Court has never said, oh, well, you've got to go and figure that out, Congress, and you've got to then come up with the decision now when you enact this statute. Instead, what Congress did here is what it commonly does, which is to provide a series and then a qualifier at the end, and that's to include all of the -- the entities that come before that. And so, in our -- in our brief to this Court, we discuss that in the very next section of the CARES Act Congress does exactly that.   It refers to cities, towns, parishes that -- that are over 500,000 people.   And Congress, in that case, could have simply looked at a census and said: Oh, parish -- there's no parish over 500,000.   We should take that out. But, under the ANCs' argument, because it included parishes and then it included a qualifier that plainly didn't apply to parishes, all the parishes should have gotten money.

So, again, it was reiterating that recognition concept in the CARES Act itself, which is why the Ute Tribe, the one that I represent primarily, although I'm representing all tribes here today, the Ute Tribe views this as something that it -- it would be better to decide this case more narrowly.

And, they -- therefore, they do not qualify for the same qualification that is within the ISDEAA. We note the United States, until now, has been saying that same exact thing all through this case.

In fact, what we have is a lot of things that -- in my view, most of the things are on the other side.

So, you know, the ANCs have numerous people who for whatever reason are not members of tribes.   We agree with Mr. Clement there. But that -- that happens everywhere.   There is millions, actually, of people who say they're Native American in the lower 48 who are not members of tribes.   That's not an uncommon thing.

Now I think the government's absurdity -- absurdity argument has more force because, in 45 years, not a one -- if we accept what the D.C.

They can give it out to tribal organizations, similar to ANCs, if they want to and if those ANCs were providing valuable services.

Rasmussen", "text": " Well, I -- I think, you know, I would not question that they know Alaska, but I think they also are motivated by getting $533 million up into Alaska instead of into the lower 40 -- mostly into the lower 48 states, divided amongst all the tribes.   They're -- so that's part of what they're doing. But, when we look at the record in this case and the examples that they use, those are not accurate. For example, CIRI, as the United States forthrightly admits, there -- there -- there aren't very many of these ISDEAA contracts in Alaska.   You get the exact opposite impression from all of the other briefs by the Petitioners and their supporters -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey S.

You told Justice Thomas and then I think you repeated again to Justice Kavanaugh that what it takes to establish a trust relationship between a native Alaskan or a Native American from the lower 48 is enrollment in a tribe. Did I understand that correctly? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey S. Rasmussen", "text": " The -- the common way of doing it now is enrollment, that it would be enrolled or enrollable under almost every tribe because they have status.

It says: \"Alaska natives shall remain eligible for all federal Indian programs on the same basis as other Native Americans notwithstanding any other provision of law.\" I would take that to mean that because of Alaska's unusual, indeed, very distinct method of handling benefits to Native Americans, that that amendment to ANCSA makes clear that that trust relationship exists even though they don't enroll in tribes.   Am I wrong about that? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey S. Rasmussen", "text": " Yes, I would say that that is incorrect, that even if you get to commerce clause issues, that you simply can't go that far.   But, in the -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " I don't understand. Why? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey S. Rasmussen", "text": " Okay.

You asserted broadly that the trust relationship between the United States and a native person is established when that native person enrolls in a tribe. And I took you to be saying that the United States doesn't have any kind of trust obligation to a native person who is unenrolled. And you invoked the example of those who live in the lower 48 who have not affiliated with any tribe, although it strikes me as different because native Alaskans, it's not just a free-floating group that self-identifies but are put into as shareholders in ANCs if they choose not to enroll in a village. So I'm trying to understand how to reconcile what you said with this language in ANCSA, and you're referring to other statutes apart from ANCSA. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey S. Rasmussen", "text": " What -- what I'm referring to is that in -- within the ANCSA, it is saying on the same basis as other tribes.

There are 220 tribes up in Alaska, and you have to enroll in one of them.

You were -- earlier in your argument, you were saying -- characterizing this as somewhat of a dispute when Justice Gorsuch was asking you about double-counting, about who delivers the benefits, whether it's the villages or the ANCs. But isn't this really about whether the lower 48 are allocated more money; in other words, that the primary dispute here isn't about governance or who serves as the intermediary or the ANCs being able to trump how the villages might decide things but what piece of the pie goes where?

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Rasmussen, we have a little bit of time left for any questions my colleagues may have that they didn't get a chance to get to. And I'll -- I'll start us off.   I want to follow up on the question Justice Barrett and Justice Kavanaugh were asking because I thought that's what the case was really all about. In other words, there are Alaska natives who are not enrolled members of a village who receive significant services from ANCs, services that the availability of what is directly impacted by the COVID pandemic. And tens of thousands of people fit that description.   And I -- I understand you're -- you're doing what lawyers do, which is trying, you know, to get more money for your clients.   But the enrolled members receive those benefits and, if you prevail, I gather, will receive more.   But the Alaska natives who benefit from the services provided by the ANCs will get -- will get nothing. And I just wonder if that's what Congress -- and maybe, you know, your plain language argument, maybe the answer is that, well, that doesn't matter, but I wonder if there's anybody in Congress who would think that Alaska natives receive significant benefits if they're enrolled in a tribe but not if their benefits are provided through the ANCs. I did not understand Congress to be sort of pushing in favor of enrollment at the expense of participation by ANCs. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey S. Rasmussen", "text": " Again, that there are significant -- excuse me -- there are significant programs that are of benefit to tribal members and others who are affiliated with -- with the tribe. That money goes through tribes.   Then how the tribes are permitted to spend that money, whether they can provide it to, for example, members of their community who are not enrolled or others, is determined by the specific statutes at issue.   There are a number of statutes that certainly permit them to do that. In this particular case, what we have -- and I think that one fundamental problem that we have here is that the actual record in this case only shows three ISDEAA contracts that are under a separate statute for cadastral surveys. The ANCs own the land and so the cadastral survey, they have the authority to -- to obtain that money. The only other one we have of record is CIRI, and as we've talked about, that has a special statute.   So the parade of horribles that they provide of, oh, this is going to deprive people of money or services, is simply false. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.

"}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   You take a minute to wrap up, Mr. Rasmussen. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey S. Rasmussen", "text": " Thank you, Your Honor. Again, our view is that the plain language is the touchstone.   This Court has said that repeatedly.   The plain language is the touchstone for making these decisions. We don't go to ratification.   We don't go to other doctrines when the language is plain.   This sentence construction here is very clear, and, therefore, the court below was correct when it said this is what -- how this case should be decided. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Guarnieri, rebuttal? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew Guarnieri", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   I have just a couple of points to make. First, with respect to our primary argument, that is, the argument that if the recognition clause is understood to refer to formal political recognition, then it should not be read to apply to ANCs, I think, really, the -- the pivot point for that argument, as the questions this morning have made clear, is whether you think there was any evidence of uncertainty about the status of ANCs when Congress enacted that language in 1975. And neither the court of appeals nor Respondents have ever identified any evidence that Congress was at any time uncertain about the sovereign status of ANCs. And there's textual evidence in ISDA to that effect.   I mean, the ISDA definition recites that ANCs were established pursuant to ANCSA.   So it's entirely implausible to think that Congress itself was uncertain about the sovereignty or, I should say, lack of sovereignty about these corporations that Congress itself had established in a -- in a then-recent federal law. Certainly, there was no doubt about that point in 2020 when Congress enacted the CARES Act and incorporated into it the ISDA definition. And as I think Justice Alito's perceptive questions have pointed out, I mean, it makes no sense to think that the CARES Act incorporated for a -- purposes of a one-time distribution of funds, the CARES Act incorporated a definition under which ANCs would be included only if at some theoretical point in the future Congress chooses to fundamentally reinvent the concept of recognition and recognize as eligible for government-to-government relations these private corporations. Now the second point I want to address is the CARES Act language about the definition of a tribal government.   The CARES Act defined the tribal government in terms that are almost word-for-word identical to the definition of a tribal organization in ISDA. And as the district court explained at pages 68 to 70 -- 68A to 70A of the appendix, ANCs have long been understood to -- to have -- to have a recognized governing body for ISDA purposes, and so too they have a recognized governing body for CARES Act purposes. And third, with respect to our alternative argument, I mean, Mr. Clement has -- has ably addressed that argument.   And -- and I would just add that, you know, our -- our -- our point is simply that it's possible that different entities could demonstrate that they are recognized as eligible to -- to participate in ISDA contracting in different ways. For the lower 48 states, the paradigm is acknowledgment by the federal government. But, for ANCs, Congress has already deemed them to be eligible by including them in this special Alaska clause in the ISDA definition. And then, finally, on the practicalities, I mean, many thousands of Alaska natives are not enrolled members of a federally recognized Indian Tribe, and that's by design and that's how Congress set it up in ANCSA. And a decision finding that ANCs are ineligible to receive these CARES Act funds and potentially ineligible to participate in the many other federal programs that rely on the same language as the ISDA definition would have serious, serious consequences for the delivery of federal services and benefits to Alaska natives.   It would disrupt the status quo that has prevailed for -- for decades. And we ask this Court to reject that interpretation and to reverse. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
