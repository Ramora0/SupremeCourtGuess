[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will now hear argument in Case 19-1189, BP P.L.C. versus the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. Mr. Shanmugam. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents a question of statutory interpretation involving the provision authorizing appellate review of certain remand orders.   The relevant provision of Section 1447(d) authorizes appellate review of a remand order where a ground for removal was the federal officer or civil rights removal statute. By its plain terms, the statute permits review of the entire order, not particular issues.   The court of appeals' contrary interpretation is invalid. Respondent offers virtually no textual defense of that interpretation, relying instead on case law, policy, and an alternative interpretation.   But those arguments cannot trump the statutory text and, in any event, lack merit. As to case law, this Court and the courts of appeals have consistently interpreted statutes permitting appellate review of an order to authorize plenary review, and Respondent's two contrary examples involve unique considerations. As to policy, the plain text interpretation is consistent with Congress's special solicitude for cases involving civil rights and federal officers.   That interpretation accords with the background principle of plenary review, would lead, at most, to marginal additional delay, and could actually expedite resolution of the appeal. And as to Respondent's alternative interpretation, a defendant removes a case pursuant to the federal officer removal statute when it invokes the statute in its notice of removal, regardless of the merits of that ground. The sole remaining question is how best to dispose of this case.   The Court should reverse the judgment below because Respondent's claims necessarily arise under federal law. This Court's precedents dictate the commonsense conclusion that federal law governs claims alleging injury caused by worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.   The court of appeals should have reached that ground for removal, and it should have held that the case was removable on that basis.   The court of appeals' judgment should therefore be reversed. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, you just said that the -- your theory applies regardless of the merits of the federal officer or the federal civil rights basis for removal. But what if the -- those bases are frivolous, that everybody who wants to keep their case in federal court will put in as many grounds for removal as they can, and they have to -- all they have to do is tack on one of these federal officer or federal civil rights grounds? Is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " In that circumstance, sanctions and fee awards would be available, as they always are, whenever a litigant makes frivolous argument, and a party could be subject to sanctions up to dismissal. Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think there's any evidence that parties engage in that conduct.   In the circuit that most clearly has adopted our rule, the Seventh Circuit, there's simply no evidence of that.   And I would -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, what if it's -- "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " -- point the Court -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- what if it's beyond frivolous? What if the court of appeals just says, you know, I think we ought to look at this, and if they're -- turns out they're wrong about the federal officer basis, we'll just send it back and we don't have to consider all these other possible grounds? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, I don't think that a court can do that because the statute obligates an appellate court to consider all of the grounds for removal.   And it contemplates a situation like this, where the federal officer or civil rights ground may not have merit.   That is why the use of the word \"order\" is so significant. And to adopt Respondent's interpretation, Congress would have had to make clear that the question or issue of federal officer or civil rights removal was all that was available on appeal.   And Congress obviously did not do that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Shanmugam, the -- I'd like to -- I may have missed your last point.   Did you say that even if the order or the bases offered by the moving party is frivolous, that it would still have to be considered? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " No.   I think, in that circumstance, the court of appeals would have the power to impose sanctions, and those sanctions would include dismissal of the appeal. I was addressing only -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I think that's -- that's -- again, I heard you say that to the Chief Justice, but why would that even be a basis for review? I think that's what we're getting at, as opposed to the sanctions. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " So I think that an alternative option that would be available to the Court would be to say, on a ground much like that that the Court adopted in Bell versus Hood, that where the federal officer or civil rights ground is frivolous, there is no appellate jurisdiction. But I think our principal submission would be that sanctions and fee awards are available where that ground is frivolous.   My last point to the Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, was simply that where the ground is not frivolous but simply is found to have lacked merit, as, indeed, the court of appeals did in this case, the court of appeals nevertheless has to address the other grounds, and that is because the order that is under review necessarily encompasses all of the grounds for removal that were asserted in the notice of removal. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Just so -- just that I -- just so that I'm clear, you're saying that the courts -- once the order is appealed, that the appellate courts have no discretion to consider grounds that were not the basis for the removal -- for the appeal? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, the court would have the power to consider all of the grounds asserted in the notice of removal, and that is because what is before the court is the order, that is, the command remanding the case to state court. And one benefit of our interpretation is that it gives the court of appeals flexibility in the other direction.   If the court of appeals concludes that there is an easier ground than federal officer removal on which to reverse, it can do so. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you.

There are -- is a big difference between frivolous and meritorious. It's called uncertainty and possible and who knows.   So they'll add, on those grounds, it will get over to the federal court.   The federal court will say that it -- it's not frivolous, but it's wrong, and, therefore, they will appeal on everything.   And that means added time, added delay, in a statute, the point of which, no appeal, is to cut down on the time and delay caused by appeal. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K.

First, in response to the specific concern about abuse, I do think it's important to keep in mind that the federal officer and civil rights removal statutes are relatively narrow.   It is certainly not going to be every civil defendant who is going to be able plausibly to invoke those statutes. And, again, there's no evidence of gamesmanship or abuse in the circuit that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, I'm not saying -- "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K.

You're not saying it's nothing. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It's not something either. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " -- Justice Breyer, I think that would take me to my second point, which is, would it have been reasonable for Congress to have made this policy determination? And I would respectfully submit that it would have been. And, again, we have no legislative history that even speaks to this issue.   Our primary submission is that the text is clear, but I think that Congress could well have concluded that in light of the significant federal interests that are often in play in these cases, that even in circumstances in which the civil rights or federal officer ground is ultimately found not to have been meritorious, that Congress, balancing the risk of erroneous remands against the risk of incremental delay, could have struck the balance to permit plenary review, consistent with the ordinary way that appellate review operates. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, you're talking about what Congress -- balance Congress could have chosen.   But I go to the fact that when Congress added 1443 to this statute, every circuit court who had addressed this issue had already ruled that the only thing that was subject to review was a -- a decision based on 1442 and had rejected your argument. Don't you think that if I'm trying to figure out what Congress intended that I would look to what was before Congress's understand -- under -- in front of Congress in its understanding, number one? Number two, that when it told me that it didn't want appellate review of all issues and that it only wanted appellate review of 1442 and 1443 issues, that our review should be limited to what it wanted?

I don't happen to be one of them, but even if I read \"order\" -- you know, \"order\" the way you want, I don't think I can read it in isolation.   And I think those two other factors make me believe that what Congress intended is not what you say. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Justice Sotomayor, with regard to ratification, first, the law was hardly settled at the time of the 2011 amendment.   It is certainly true that several circuits had adopted Respondent's interpretation, but they did so with conclusory reasoning, and most of them predated this Court's decision in Yamaha, where the Court construed a statute using materially identical language in the opposite direction. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Except that -- "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Second -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- Yamaha had already been decided, counsel, and despite that, those circuit courts were ruling against you. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, I think most of the circuit decisions that Respondent invokes predated Yamaha.   There were a few that postdated it.   But our submission is simply that Yamaha ought to be taken into account. In addition, Congress merely added two words.   It did not reenact the entire provision. It didn't make comprehensive amendments.   And it's hard to say with any confidence that Congress's failure to speak more clearly reflects approval of those preexisting circuit decisions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Shanmugam, when you were talking with the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas about frivolous cases, you seemed to want to rely on sanctions rather than a -- a kind of Bell v. Hood rule. And I'm -- I'm -- I'm wondering, why isn't a Bell v. Hood rule that says that the Court has no jurisdiction with respect to frivolous assertions of that kind -- why isn't that the better way to go? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I think that option is available to the Court, Justice Kagan, as we said in our brief.   And if the Court thinks that sanctions and fee awards would be insufficient in this context, knowing that that is what the Court ordinarily relies on to deter improper conduct by litigants, I think that the Court could adopt a Bell versus Hood-like rule. And, again, if there were more evidence that this was a problem -- and Respondent does not cite a single example of the sort of gamesmanship that it posits -- then perhaps the Court should take that further step. But, again, as this Court recognized, for instance, in Arthur Andersen in the context of appeals in the arbitration context, sanctions and fee awards paradigmatically would apply in a situation like this where a party is advancing a frivolous argument and doing that for an improper purpose, namely, for the purpose of establishing appellate jurisdiction where there otherwise would not be any. And whether that's a matter of statutory fee-shifting or sanctions, Rule 11 sanctions, or even the use of a court's inherent authority, again, the sanction of dismissal would be available, dismissal of the appeal, and I think that that would suffice to deal with those situations.

And for -- for a party arguing that we need to follow the strict language of the statute with respect to our jurisdiction of orders, I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure I understand where -- where this authority to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, frivolous arguments, might -- might emanate, what penumbra it emanates from?

I think a problem for you here is the ratification doctrine that Justice Sotomayor raised, and best I can tell, all the courts of appeals had not adopted this reading as of 2011, that no court had deviated from that interpretation. You know, what are -- what are we to do with that? Is it -- are we to say that the ratification doctrine really doesn't have that much force, which, you know, I think it sometimes is overused, just speaking for myself, or how are we to get around that here if -- from -- from your perspective of trying to convince us to adopt your position?

Shanmugam", "text": " I don't think so, Justice Barrett, because that issue really goes to the appropriate disposition in this Court, whether the Court should simply vacate and remand or reverse outright.   And that issue is fully briefed here.   And we believe that the answer is clear under this Court's long-standing precedents. And there's also, I think, a very significant prudential reason for the Court to reach that issue because, as you are aware, there are some 20 of these cases pending nationwide in courts around the country, and, indeed, there are a number of cert petitions in follow-on cases that are currently pending before this Court. And I think, in light of all of those considerations, it would be appropriate for the Court to resolve that question.   And the answer to that question is clear, because this Court, for more than a century, has applied federal common law to claims seeking redress for interstate pollution, including most notably in AEP with regard to very similar nuisance claims alleging injury from global climate change.

And when you have a unanimous, clear decision from this Court construing materially identical language in court of appeals decisions that really had very conclusory, if any, reasoning, I think that the law was unclear. And when you add onto that that all that Congress did here was merely to add two words, \"1442 or,\" I don't think that you can conclude that there is ratification, particularly when you go back to the original version of 1447(d) in the Civil Rights Act, where Congress was plainly very concerned about the risk of local prejudice.

So, as we've been discussing, we believe that the plain language of Section 1447(d) resolves the question permitted -- presented and -- and really does permit an appellate court to review the entirety of a remand order where a ground for removal was the federal officer removal statute. But we do also respectfully submit that the Court should proceed to ensure that this case and the many others like it proceed in federal court.   There is something profoundly counterintuitive about the notion that these cases which seek relief for injuries caused by worldwide greenhouse gas emissions should be litigated in state courts under the laws of different states. This Court has long made clear that, as a matter of constitutional structure, such claims necessarily arise under federal law.   The United States has agreed with that proposition. And resolving that issue now will preserve the resources of the judiciary and the parties and ensure the orderly resolution of these cases. And, accordingly, this Court should not simply vacate but reverse the court of appeals' judgment. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lucas. "}, {"speaker": "Brinton Lucas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should hold that Section 1447(d) means what it says.   There is simply no natural way to read the phrase \"an order remanding a case\" as part of an order remanding a case.   Therefore, once Section 1447(d) authorizes an appeal of a remand order, there's no basis for artificially limiting the scope of that appeal to a particular question. Respondent resists that straightforward reading but never denies that its approach would give the phrase \"an order remanding a case\" different meanings in two back-to-back clauses of the same sentence. Instead, Respondent pivots to a novel textual theory in its merits brief based on the phrase \"removed pursuant to.\" But that argument can't be squared with how removal actually works.   At the end of the day, Respondent's arguments are really about policy, namely, a legislative desire to prevent delay.   But, when Congress has already authorized an appeal of a remand order, considering multiple issues is unlikely to prolong litigation much further and may, in fact, expedite it. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, I would like to get back to the question I asked your friend previously.   Is the appellate court required to consider those additional grounds for removal or simply permitted to do so?

So, there, this Court declined to answer the question that was certified in the interlocutory order because it was based on an incorrect premise.   And had this Court taken an approach similar to the one Respondent advocates here, it would be left with essentially adjudicating a question that didn't really matter because it rested on the wrong foundation.

Yamaha was decided in 1996.   Congress amended the statute in 2011.   In that period gap of 15 years, Wright and Miller had questioned the majority rule but suggested that it needed Congress to change it because it read the limitation the way that Respondents do.

And I do think that if you look at all the court of appeals decisions that Respondent cites in its brief, all of them are very conclusory and they're not really engaged with the text at all.   To the extent there's any analysis at all in these court of appeals decisions, they're really rooted in purpose. And I think a good example is the earliest decision that I'm aware of on this subject from the Sixth Circuit in the Appalachian Volunteers case. And on the other side of the ledger, not only do you have Wright and Miller making the textual argument, you also have this Court's decision not only in Yamaha but also in cases in other contexts going back to the Iron Works case from 1897 construing \"order\" as it's plainly understood.

You have the text that you assert, your reading of the text in -- in Yamaha obviously helps you, but there are also problems.

On gamesmanship, I just want to underscore that Respondent has neither identified any evidence of abuse in the circuits that review the entire remand order, nor really offered any compelling reason to expect that situation to change. And if problems ever do arise in the limited set of cases where a defendant can plausibly invoke Section 1447(d)'s exception, at the end of the day, they can always be addressed by Congress. In the meantime, the theoretical possibility of undesirable consequences is no reason to carve up undeniably appealable remand orders into reviewable and unreviewable portions. Rather, appellate courts should be able to figure out whether a remand order resulted from a legal error, even if that error doesn't involve federal officers or civil rights.   That's how this Court has approached other types of orders, and there's no good reason for treating remand orders any differently. Once Congress has authorized an appeal under Section 1447(d), it doesn't serve anyone for appellate courts to artificially limit the scope of their review. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sher. "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: According to Petitioners, merely referring to Section 1442 in a removal notice guarantees a defendant an appeal as of right of every ground rejected by the district court, even if the 1442 ground is meritless and even if the defendant drops it on appeal. That is not a permissible reading of 1447(d).   That section, a general prohibition subject to a narrow exception, tethers appellate review to two designated grounds, 1442 and 43, and to those grounds only. This Court has never held that review of an order necessarily encompasses every issue addressed in an order.   Its interpretation of similarly worded statutes proves this. Moreover, the exception clause limits review to removals pursuant to 1442 or 43, meaning where the removal was in compliance with or in accordance with those statutes. The court of appeals must decide if federal officer jurisdiction exists, not merely whether a defendant asserted it perhaps as a bootstrap to obtain review of grounds otherwise absolutely barred. This case was not removed pursuant to 1442 because, as the courts below held, Petitioners do not qualify for federal officer removal.   Petitioners' interpretation thus runs counter to the language and structure of 1447(d), and even if the language were not clear, their view violates basic principles of statutory interpretation. Finally, Petitioners' construction ignores that in 2011 Congress ratified 50 years of unanimous circuit court authority that limited review of remand orders to the exception clause's enumerated grounds and only to those grounds.   And the courts in those cases held that the language was clear, and that was what supported their jurisdictional analysis. I welcome your questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, you just said that your -- the Petitioners' reading of 1447(d) is contrary to the language of the statute. I will give you an uninterrupted three minutes to explain to me how the language \"an order remanding a case shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise\" should be read to say a portion of an order remanding a case shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise, solely with respect to the text of that. I know you have arguments outside the text, but, with respect to the actual text, what's -- what's -- what's your best argument? "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " Sure, Your Honor.   The first thing we have to keep in mind is that you have to look at the sentence as a whole, including the first clause, which is a general and absolute bar on appellate review remand orders. So then, when we look at the second clause, we have to look at the words not in isolation but as in -- in relation to their neighbors.   And, there, we see that an order is reviewable but only if it is an order that -- in which the removal was pursuant to Section 1442 or 1443. Petitioners assert that \"pursuant to\" is merely a label in the removal notice.   But we know that can't be right because, for example, in an earlier section, in 1446, which is actually the procedure for removal of civil actions, the removing party has to -- the attorney has to file pursuant to Rule 11. And Rule 11 has both a procedural signature component and substantive, that is, that the grounds have to be done not for delay and with substantial basis in the evidence, et cetera. Now the key point is that the issue isn't whether the order is reviewable but what the scope of that review is.   And both the structure of the sentence, that is, the tethering to 1442 and 1443, and this Court's treatment of similar language in other statutes, like 1257, the Criminal Appeals Act, and Section 1291, review -- review of single orders is limited to certain issues within those orders, even though this language of the statute itself doesn't distinguish among those issues. So, for all those reasons, the use of the word \"order\" and the use of the word \"reviewable\" have never meant to this Court that that necessarily means a reviewing court has to address every single issue raised within an order. To the contrary, this Court has -- has frequently disentangled issues and made clear in cases like Swint and Abney and Behrens, all of which Petitioners ignore, that you cannot use an -- an appealable issue as a ticket for multi-issue appeals that are not allowed. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, I -- I don't want to belabor the point, but I think it's an important point. Could you give us -- you mentioned some cases that support your point.   Could you give us further details about those cases and why they support your point? "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " Sure, Your Honor.   And let me -- let me point to one other structural thing in Section 1447 itself that supports this analysis.   Section 1447(c) says that an order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and expenses incurred as a result of the removal.   So it requires the award of fees to be part of the order. The circuits that have looked at this -- and it's 12 of them; only the Federal Circuit has not -- have held that the award of fees is reviewable even if the rest of the order falls within the bar of the general non-reviewability clause. As to your -- as to your specific question about cases, in Swint, a case involving Section 1983 claims, there was a single order denying motions for summary -- summary judgment. This Court said that the portion of the order denying qualified immunity was reviewable but the -- not an order whether specific defendants were policymakers.   That portion of the order was not reviewable. In Abney, there was a single order, and it was okay for the appellate court to -- to review the order denying the motion to dismiss with respect to double jeopardy but not with respect to the same order denying challenge to the sufficiency of an indictment. And, in Behrens, a wrongful discharge -- discharge case, Justice Scalia explained that a single order could be reviewed with respect to the issue of denying qualified immunity but not with respect to determinations of evidentiary sufficiency. And in our brief, we discuss the cases under the Criminal Appeals Act and as well as under Section 1257.   You cannot allow a party that has a non-meritorious issue, as defendants -- sorry, as Petitioners have here, to use that issue as a hook to open up issues that this Court and the statute have plainly barred.

I -- I -- I see the linguistic argument, which is tough for you, but I see the argument from -- that's order, and the argument from Yamaha, you have to overcome those.   I'm not focusing on those. I want to focus on a problem that occurred to me.   It's in every legal system. It's important to have an appeal.   It's -- it's unfair not to give people appeals.   But, if you give them appeals in the middle of the case, too often you will really muck up the system, take too long.   And so we allow some things to go ahead even though there was no appeal and it might be unfair and wrong because we don't want to muck up the system.   That's what I see underlying this statute since 1887.   You know? No, no appeal.   But now they have an appeal on some things.   So you're not going to waste a lot of time; it's in the court of appeals anyway.   You'll waste some time if you let them have other things.   But the big waste, the big time-consuming thing, is getting the appeal in the first place. Now it's here.   So we've undercut the main reason for not giving people an appeal. We've undercut it, not destroyed it. Now, if that's correct policy, then that's on the other side that you're trying to argue.   So I want you to see what you think. "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " I don't -- I don't think it is, Your Honor.   These grounds for appeal, as this Court explained in the Ruiz case talking about why that provision was jurisdictional and limited to a single issue, diversity jurisdiction is a good example, Your Honor. You don't obtain diversity jurisdiction by having a colorable argument that there's diversity jurisdiction.   You either have it or you do not.   The same is true for federal officer jurisdiction.   It either exists or it does not.   And if it does not, then the plain language of the -- we think the plain language of the statute limits and tethers the appellate court's scope of review and that's the end of the issue. The notion that there's a -- an efficiency that requires a court -- is based on two assumptions, both of which are wrong, by the Petitioners.   The first is that there's a link somehow between asserted grounds for removal. But the fact that a party has asserted federal officer jurisdiction, which it does not have and which, in -- in this Court, it doesn't challenge, does not mean that it's entitled to bankruptcy jurisdiction or admiralty jurisdiction or federal enclave jurisdiction or any of the other jurisdictional assertions that have been made by the Petitioners in this case. There's no link.   There's no reason to open up the other issues. And, second, just as a matter of statutory construction, you don't have to read the second clause narrowly to understand that it -- that it confines the broad language of the first language.   How does it confine it? Well, it restricts it to Sections 1442 and 1443. And 50 years -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Oh.

Two -- two points. The first is that it's factually incorrect that the nine circuits that addressed this issue prior to 2011 contain no analysis. They all found the language clear, the -- the -- the commonsense reading of the statute clear, and many of them pointed that -- that out in particular. But, with respect to the body of case law, Petitioners and the United States ignore, and I think it's significant, a couple of important cases from this Court.   The first is Helsinn from 2019, a unanimous opinion in which the Court was confronted with a line of cases from the Federal Circuit involving interpretation of patent law, and the -- the -- the Federal Circuit, of course, had -- was the only one with jurisdiction over these issues. The Court relied on that land -- that line of cases out of the Federal Circuit and the fact that Congress reenacted not just the same language but added only a new catch-all phrase. And as the Court and the United States' amicus in that case said, that would be an -- an -- a very oblique way of attempting to overturn the settled body of law. The settled body of law comes from what a practitioner looking at nine unanimous circuits over 50 years would think at the time, and that is that where there is a federal officer or civil rights assertion and other issues, the only issue that the court of appeals has jurisdiction to review are those issues, and that's what Congress ratified by reenacting the language and only adding \"1442 or.\" There was also -- and -- and -- and we cite to the House report, which -- which points out that the reason for this addition was specifically to protect federal officers from removal, as civil rights cases do because, otherwise, there is no way to get the issue into the court of appeals. So Congress put its thumb on the scales for two issues, federal officer and -- and civil rights, because there were important public policy reasons to protect those kinds of defendants against district court error. In all other cases, Congress has made clear and the courts have consistently held, as has this Court, that the -- if it's a -- if it's a subject matter jurisdiction issue or another ground barred by 1447(c), there is no right to appellate review.

And, again, the statistics from the Seventh Circuit are actually ambiguous because, as the state and local government associations' amici point out, while, in Lu Junhong, the Seventh Circuit said that following our opinion it would be frivolous to assert federal officer removal as a basis for removal in future cases, in fact, there have been future cases in other -- albeit in other circuits, raising exactly the same issue.

But we see them asserted continually. And -- and, again, as the same amicus as well as the New York State amici point out, that removal has become a tactic of defendants in a wide range of cases, including environmental regulation, opioids, sub-prime lending in financial institutions and others.   And in every one of those instances, there -- these involve national industries heavily regulated by the federal government and you -- you could have colorable assertions. And -- and -- and a rule that broadly opened the gates to other issues and appellate rights would not only result in longer delays but would burden the -- the records of the courts.

Moving on to a different question, as Justice Gorsuch said, I think, the text in isolation is a problem for you, and that means the text is a problem for you. You also, I think, have a problem with Yamaha.   And, you know, it's never good to be on the wrong side of Justice Ginsburg opinion, but particularly on a jurisdictional issue, and what she wrote for the Court there is, \"As the text of Section 1292(b) indicates, appellate jurisdiction applies to the order certified to the court of appeals and is not tied to the particular question formulated by the district court.\" And that language, as you know well, is -- is similar.

And Yamaha's reference to \"order\" was in the context of a particular statute, who -- setting aside congressional intent and purpose, which I'm not -- which I think also cut in our favor here, but simply looking at the language of Section 1292(b), it is not similar in its commonsense reading to the commonsense reading of 1447(d).

You cited Helsinn, and that was -- that's a good case for you to cite, I -- I agree, but that -- that was relying mostly on the fact that our precedent -- we were sticking with our precedent. And it did mention the reenactment. But Professor Eskridge, in his treatises, has pointed out that the presumed intent justification behind that doctrine is, in his words, \"unusually weak.\" And I just wonder how much work it can do here given that it -- it's really not clear, we don't have any indication, that Congress actually -- or members actually focused on this and intended in any way to ratify the interpretation. Can you respond to that? "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   First of all, in Helsinn, the point was there was not controlling authority from this case -- I'm sorry, from this Court, but, rather, there was from a circuit court, the federal court -- the Federal Circuit.

So I want to talk about your \"pursuant to\" argument, in which you say that a case hasn't been removed pursuant to 1442 or 1443 unless it has been correctly removed pursuant to those cases. So, in other words, in this case, because the officer removal ground was flawed, we couldn't say that this case had been removed pursuant to the officer removal ground.

"}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " Correct.   And the answer is yes.   In fact, it was the Fourth Circuit in a 1969 opinion called House v. Dorsey, 408 F.2d 1008, it was a 1443 removal solely.   The court of appeals looked at it and held that the removing party did not qualify under 1443 and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well, the court didn't do that here, right? Because, I mean, if you're right, it seems like on appeal, if the Fourth Circuit in this case concluded as it did that the remand order was proper, that it had not been properly removed under the federal officer removal statute, they should have dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, not affirm the remand order, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " Yeah, correct, Your Honor. The -- the general practice, though, in fact, the universal practice in the courts that have applied a commonsense language interpretation to the statute, has been to dismiss the other grounds asserted for lack of jurisdiction and then either affirm or reverse on -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But that's inconsistent -- that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " -- on the merits of this particular case. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But, counsel, that's inconsistent with your reading of the statute because, if the Court doesn't have jurisdiction unless the case has been properly removed pursuant to, say, the federal officer removal statute, there's no jurisdiction.   It can't affirm.   It would have to dismiss even on that ground.   So if courts were implicitly -- "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " Not quite, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " -- seeing it your way, they wouldn't procedurally be disposing of these cases this way. "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " So -- so there -- there are two -- two things.   One is we offer two different ways of reaching the same result.   One is under a commonsense language reading of the statute in which the words \"pursuant to\" qualify the exception and tether the -- the appellate court's review to those issues, but it's not necessarily -- as Your Honor points out, it's not necessarily a jurisdictional analysis.   It just means that the appeal has to be limited and focused on those grounds. The other reading is the jurisdictional analysis, which we think flows from the use of terms that this Court has consistently held have substantive jurisdictional meanings, for instance, in Helmerich and in Ruiz, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " So, counsel, I just want to ask a clarifying question.   When you say the jurisdictional analysis, is that the analysis that I just asked you about? Is that what you're calling a jurisdictional analysis of \"pursuant to\"? "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, \"pursuant to\" -- \"pursuant to\" establishes a jurisdictional threshold and that a -- a -- a -- a case must substantively comply with the requirements of 1442 in order for the case to have been removed pursuant to that provision.

"}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " -- let me turn you back to your other \"pursuant to\" argument, which, as I understand it, kind of implicitly means pursuant exclusively to. Does that make sense? Because then someone who had a basis for removing under, say, the civil rights removal statute would be discouraged from including any other grounds. "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " No, Your Honor.   The -- the -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " At risk of forfeiting appeal. "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " No, Your Honor.   The -- the -- the -- the point is that on appeal, having been remanded, the error that can be corrected by the court of appeals is limited to the specified ground.   And that's what the commonsense reading is.   Nothing is allowed except it is allowed to look at orders remanding pursuant to specific provisions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " A minute to wrap up, Mr. Sher. "}, {"speaker": "Victor M. Sher", "text": " And that's -- that's -- yes.   Thank you, Your Honor. The best commonsense reading, following up on this colloquy, of the exception clause is that it creates a limited exception to 1447(d)'s general bar on appellate review for federal officer and civil rights grounds and only for those grounds. Petitioners' reading would create an exception that swallows that rule, an exception that would apply to one group and one group alone: defendants who make meritless claims to removal on either of them.   The text does not compel this reading, and it is implausible to think that is what Congress intended. The interpretation also runs contrary to the principles and purposes that animate Section 1447(d).   Consistent with nearly unanimous view of the lower courts, including the four circuit courts to decide this issue in the last year, and consistent with the view ratified by Congress in 2011, this Court should affirm. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, rebuttal? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. There is one fundamental problem with Respondents' argument today.   It finds no home in the actual language of Section 1447(d). There's simply no way as a matter of ordinary English to construe \"order\" to mean merely a portion of an order.   In Yamaha, Justice Ginsburg, writing for a unanimous court, relied on that plain meaning to reach the same conclusion. And Respondents' interpretation would have the added consequence of giving the phrase \"order remanding a case\" different meanings in different clauses of the very same statutory sentence. Respondents' only colorable textual argument here is its ratification argument, but, Justice Kavanaugh, this is anything but a classic case for ratification, especially in the absence of any relevant legislative history. As Justice Scalia explained in his opinion for the Court in Alexander versus Sandoval, the relevant inquiry is whether one can \"assert with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to act represents affirmative congressional approval of the court's statutory interpretation.\" Here, there is simply no reason to believe that Congress was preferring the unreasoned decisions of some courts of appeals construing this statute over the reasoned decisions of this Court construing materially identical ones, particularly given the technical nature of the 2011 amendment. Congress could well have concluded that it wanted plenary review in these cases and that the value of correcting erroneous remands in these specific contexts outweigh the cost of any incremental delay. Justice Thomas, you expressed concern that this could lead to the smuggling in of additional issues on appeal. Of course, under Section 1291, plenary review is the default, not the exception, in our appellate system, but there's no reason to believe that there are going to be a lot of these cases. As the DRI amicus brief notes, in the five years since the Seventh Circuit adopted our interpretation, there have only been six notices of removal citing either of these statutes and only three appeals in those cases. And, again, sanctions and fees are available to deter any abuse.   Indeed, the very provisions at issue here specifically state that notices of removal are subject to the requirements of Rule 11. And, finally, delay is not a significant concern here.   Justice Sotomayor, the reason there has been delay in this case has not been because of the other grounds for removal, which, because of its erroneously narrow view of its own jurisdiction, the court of appeals after all did not reach. Our rule would enable courts of appeals to resolve these appeals more efficiently where a court concludes that there is an easier ground for removal than the often fact-intensive federal officer ground, and there would be delay only in a case in which a federal court stays the state court proceedings on remand, which would occur only when the court determines that a defendant is likely to succeed on its appeal. There's, therefore, no good policy reason to override the plain text of Section 1447(d), and because there is plainly federal jurisdiction over these claims, this Court should therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment.
