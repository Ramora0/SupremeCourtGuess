Elwood", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   It has long been a bedrock principle of American law that aiding and abetting liability requires proof that an accomplice acted with purposeful intent to facilitate or encourage the crime of conviction and that mere knowing assistance is insufficient. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Do you agree that the jury could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge under a proper instruction?   In other words, was there sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were given, there could have been a conviction? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " Even if the -- I think in this particular case, even if the jury had been given a proper instruction, it would have been a difficult charge to make out because the government never really argued facilitation after getting knowledge of the firearm.   There was never evidence of foreknowledge; the government never asserted evidence of foreknowledge. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, I guess we can get into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is being carried and if you then facilitate the commission of the underlying felony by driving the car, participating in the transaction, whether that's sufficient.   But let me ask you this: Would the instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would it be okay if Paragraph 1,   \"The defendant knew his cohort used a firearm. \"   I think there is a real problem with that, because it's retrospective.   Would the instruction have been sufficient if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was carrying?   Would that change it? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " Well, I think at least that would have required foreknowledge.   But I think it would still have been problematic because it would only have required knowing facilitation.   And courts, traditionally, have required intentional facilitation, that is, they intend to further the crime.

The question is whether you-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --Okay.

And then you drive him to West Virginia to spend the weekend dealing.   On the way there he tells you, the guy who distributed these to me, you know, he always carries a Derringer in his boot.   And at that point, you don't facilitate his use or carriage of the gun with respect to the drug distribution offense.   It has no role in -- in the crime.   And so I think you can conceive of enough circumstances-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " --And I don't -- I don't understand the example.   The -- the alleged aider and abetter learns about this after it's happened?   That's the idea? "}, {"speaker": "John P.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, let me change -- let me -- maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's hypothetical, but let me try it.   Suppose that two guys have a meeting and it's -- it's in a place that's -- where there's an electronic eavesdropping device.   In fact, there's a camera.   So it's all recorded.   So we know exactly what was said.   And the principal says, here's the deal, I'm going to rob a convenience store and I'm going to carry a gun.   And the aider and abetter says, well, all right.   I'm in on the -- you know, I'm in on robbing the convenience store, but I don't want anything having to do with the gun.   I think you should carry a baseball bat.   The principal says, no, that's the deal.   I'm robbing the store.   I'm carrying a gun.   Take it or leave it.   Are you going to drive me there?   And -- and the other guy says, I hate guns, I don't want to have anything to do with guns.   I -- I hate this idea about the guns.   They go back and forth.   And the -- the principal says finally, look, this is it.   This is the deal.   I'm using a gun.   Are you going to help me or not?   And the guy says, well, all right.   I'm going to drive you, but I want it noted for the record that I'm opposed -- I'm opposed to the use of a gun.   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "John P.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " See -- so I don't really see -- I can't -- I can't think of a situation where a person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but doesn't intend for the gun to be used.

If you could give it to us again. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " Well, the point of it is that at a time when you are -- when you are still participating in the underlying offense, the drug trafficking offense, you know that a gun is being carried in relation to it.   But you don't have any intent to facilitate it.   You don't care one way or the other if it gets used.   You don't intend to facilitate it, and you don't facilitate it.   And the question is whether you-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But you facilitate-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, that's -- that's a conclusion.   The jury, it seems to me, could say you do facilitate it if in these hypotheticals you drive the car-- "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " --But the thing is-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

And the question is whether you even need to trouble the jury with it.   Because the government's instruction conclusively presumes both knowledge -- or conclusively presumes intent from knowledge alone and it conclusively presumes facilitation of the gun from facilitation of the underlying offense.

Elwood", "text": " I think that in your case with the foreknowledge and where he, you know, facilitates, he carries the gun and he carries the person to the offense, I think that that would be a tough slog.   In a case -- but ours is a case where there isn't foreknowledge and the government never argued that he knew before the gun -- before the gun was fired that it was his associate who was the shooter. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, in my case -- and I'll finish.   I want to ask another question about this.   But in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's enough that he knew about it.   He facilitated the crime when he knew there was a gun.   Would that be error? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " I think it would be error because you're instructing them on the wrong elements.   It might be harmless error.   But the point -- both sides agree here that you have to facilitate the crime of conviction and you have to intend that the gun be used. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I don't think it's ever harmless error to not instruct the jury -- or to instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the crime.   If, indeed, intent is necessary, it seems to me he has to instruct the jury to find intent.   It's not up to the court to say, well, there surely was intent anyway so it's harmless error.   The jury has to find intent. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " I think -- you know what, I'm fine with it being a harmful error, too.   But my point was merely to note that I think that it is something that you have to instruct the jury on as a proper element-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Excuse me.   But what are we instructing-- "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " --even if it winds up not making a difference. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --I think what we're driving at here, and I think this is the moment you're resisting, but to me, and as you can tell from my colleague's questions, if you know that someone's carrying a gun, and whether you want them to use it or not is irrelevant, if they take it out and use it and you have gone along with them in the crime, you're guilty.   Okay?   That -- that's what we're driving at.   Assume that I believe that.   Assume that I believe that if you have knowledge of the gun, and that I am participating in the crime with your knowledge of that gun, whether the knowledge is secured before the crime starts or during the crime, if I continue to participate in the crime knowing that you have a gun, then that's knowledge of the gun and intent to facilitate.   I thought the example that you were relying on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case, you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the crime because the alleged shooter, which your client said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car took off before anybody could abandon the crime.   That's what I actually thought this case was about: At what juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have to be a participant with knowledge of the crime?   But you're saying something different right now.   You're almost suggesting that there has to be a pre-knowledge that the gun will be used. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " No, I don't think -- I don't think that there has to be pre-knowledge.   My point is this: That there are circumstances I think where you can know of a gun and be participating in the underlying -- underlying predicate offense and not facilitate the use of the gun.   And I-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm hard to imagine that.   Give me an example. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " --For example, if you -- your job, you're the lowest level guy in a drug organization.   You stand on a street corner every night and you hand out drugs to anybody who comes up.   You don't carry a gun.   Nobody has ever carried a gun at that street corner.   One night you're doing it and you see that the guy is -- that the guy who you work for, his enforcer is coming by and you know he always carries a gun.   He walks behind you and, you know, he's present and around you for about 90 seconds, but during that time, you do exactly what you always did.   I think a jury could conclude -- and I'm not saying that they couldn't conclude otherwise, but they could conclude that he didn't facilitate the use or carriage of the gun.   He was just-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What would the instruction look like? "}, {"speaker": "John P.

Those are what we think would be the proper instruction, that they just have to be instructed on the facilitation and on the intent.

Elwood", "text": " I think you have to have prior knowledge before you facilitate it.   I think that-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " --Right.   Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So what did you mean by -- by you don't need prior knowledge? "}, {"speaker": "John P.

If you continue to -- if there's an act of facilitation after you learn of it-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " After you know. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " --Right.   Exactly.   That's all I mean by the absence of prior knowledge.   But I mean, everyone here agrees that you need to have knowledgeable or facilitation. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Elwood, you're dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals.   But in this case we had a jury determination that Rosemond was the person -- he was convicted of carrying ammunition, right?   There were two counts of carrying -- possession of the ammunition.   And couldn't one infer from that that he -- he possessed the ammunition, he was the gun carrier? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " Two things, Justice Ginsburg.   First, the government never raised this below and it wasn't pressed or passed on below, and so I think under Glover v. United States this Court wouldn't ordinarily consider that in the first instance, would leave it for remand.   But secondly, I think that it's not clear enough.   I mean, you can't say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error didn't infect that, too, because the jury was instructed four times that you can possess something through constructive possession, through a confederate.   And I think when the jury concludes that he is guilty of a possession offense, which is 924(c) as a possession offense, as an aider and abetter, and they marked on the judge's instruction that he used the gun, he carried the gun, that the jury could have believed that they were -- that he constructively possessed the gun and thereby constructively possessed the ammunition. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What was the evidence that the jury had on whether he possessed the ammunition? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " I think the only evidence of possession was that it was inside the gun that was fired.   And I think the jury rejected the idea that he was the shooter because the two eyewitnesss said that the shooter was someone else, that the shooter was the guy in the backseat, who was Ronald Joseph. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I just didn't -- you said the only evidence was that it was inside the gun? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " The ammunition was inside the gun.   And the only evidence of his-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And what was the evidence?   I thought there was evidence that he possessed cartridges. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " --No.   The only evidence was that the evidence was inside the gun -- or I'm sorry, the evidence -- that the ammunition was inside the gun. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And was there any evidence that he had the gun? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " The evidence that he had the gun was the -- the guy who was the other shooter-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I mean, was the evidence that he had the gun and the evidence of the cartridges are exactly the same? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " --They are exactly the same.   The only evidence was that the cartridges were inside the gun.   And the evidence -- the two eyewitnesss who were at the scene said that the person got out of the driver's side, and the evidence suggests that Mr. Rosemond was on the passenger side, and that he got out of the backseat, and he was in the front seat.   So the -- the evidence, I think, is that he was -- he was merely in the car, not that he was a shooter.   And the jury, remember, asked: Do we have to answer question 3, which was the -- all the different ways you can use the gun -- if we find him guilty on an aiding and abetting theory?   Which certainly suggests they did not believe he was the shooter. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Did -- did he facilitate the crime after the shots were fired? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " The government did not ever argue facilitation after the shots were fired, I suspect because -- they only argued that he -- that what happened afterwards was evidence he was the shooter.   I suspect because they appreciated that the offense was over with.   He was only charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.   When Mr. Gonzales took off with the marijuana and they lost control, you know, they went around afterwards looking for him, which, you know, there's not even very much evidence of that. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But do we have cases that say that assisting flight immediately after the crime is not aiding and abetting the crime?   The crime is over?   So everybody says the crime's over.   Let's -- let's walk home. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " I -- I am not aware and the government hasn't cited any.   I mean, there's -- there's -- for different crimes, you know, there's -- there's different law about whether flight is part of the offense.   But in any event, the question is whether that would be aiding and abetting that crime, the possession offense or some distinct crime, or whether that would be being an accessory after the fact.   And that was never charged. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Is it -- is it just flight?   I thought there was evidence that they were chasing the people who robbed them. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " There was no evidence that that intent to chase them was ever communicated to Mr. Rosemond. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, he jumps in the car and, you know, they're going after them. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " That itself was disputed.   But the question is, even if they're chasing him, that might be attempt to possess the marijuana to get it back.   It might be conspiracy to possess the marijuana, but that wasn't -- wasn't charged.   The only thing was possession. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, it might be -- it might be an effort to continue the crime of -- in other words, it might make a difference whether the people who are being chased look and see two guys in the car or three guys in the car.   If somebody says -- and I realize you dispute these facts -- let's go get them and the guy jumps in the car, it seems to me that that's aiding and abetting the underlying illegal activity with knowledge, of course, that guns were used. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " I agree.   But first, that's not a theory that the government ever espoused.   They never argued that facilitation.   And secondly, I don't know that that would be facilitation of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it.   That ended under the court's instructions when they lost control of the marijuana when Mr. Gonzales disappeared. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I understand your argument about intent, but are you also arguing that the -- that the actus reus instruction was insufficient?   The instruction about what your client did? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Do you think it's necessary for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of a criminal offense? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " We're not saying that.   We are saying that when you -- you have to instruct them did he facilitate the actual crime of conviction.   Because what the government is doing here, what their instruction does is it conclusively presumes that he facilitated the distinct offense, which this Court has said, the entirely new crime of 924(c), from the fact that they did the underlying offense.   Their favorite example in the brief is a mail fraud example.   But under the government's theory, because you engage in an act of mail fraud, you could be convicted of racketeering without any additional actus reus because that is a predicate crime to RICO.   And that's the thing is we're just saying you can't presume the full offense -- facilitation of the full offense from the fact that you just facilitated one element. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So if there were not -- if the -- the drug offense were not illegal, there -- there wasn't a drug offense and then the -- the additional firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him -- for the defendant to facilitate every element of that offense.   It's dependent on the fact that there's this other criminal conduct. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " We're just saying that they have to be -- the jury just has to be instructed to ask, did he facilitate the crime of conviction?   And they're asking a different -- they're asking a different question, essentially.   And it wouldn't present the same risk that you would convict someone twice and they'd serve two consecutive sentences under the hypothetical you suggest, but we still say they should be asked whether they facilitated the right crime. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, but the crime of conviction was -- was a drug offense with the use of a firearm, right? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " It was 924(c), a crime with the long name. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " And so I thought -- I thought that the law is pretty clear that if you -- if you facilitate an offense, you do not have to facilitate each element of that offense, so long as you have knowledge that that element existed. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " And our submission is just that the jury still has to be asked, did he facilitate the crime.   This is -- both sides agree that you have to ask -- that one of the elements is whether they facilitated the crime. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But -- but more precisely, they could be asked did he facilitate the drug deal knowing that a firearm was going to be used in the drug deal.   Would that satisfy you? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " No.   We think they're asking both the wrong questions then.   But -- is there-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I don't understand what your position is.   He has to use the gun himself? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " --No.   His -- our only position is that they have to ask the jury, did he facilitate the 924(c) offense. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " No.   I think it would help if you told us what the definition of the crime is.   We'll talk about the jury instructions later.   Justice Scalia is asking whether or not if you facilitate the drug crime knowing that a weapon is being carried, if that is sufficient for aiding and abetting as a legal matter?   Forget the jury instructions. "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " And it's our submission that you have to both facilitate the 924(c) offense and that you have to have the intent that the gun be used or carried during and in relation to the crime. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Does that -- does that have to do with the additional 120 months?   The underlying crime is 48 months and then the -- the gun makes it 120 months more consecutive? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " That's right.   But it's -- I think our -- the reason why we think it makes a difference is because it's a different crime.   And the government is trying to get the jury to conclusively presume from the fact that you did the one crime, that you must also have facilitated the other.   And we just don't think that that is something that you can say with 100 percent certainty so you can remove it from jury determination. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Isn't criminal law -- isn't criminal law replete with crimes which have lesser included offenses as part of them?   So wouldn't your rule be a very difficult one to apply because it would suggest that the person had to facilitate some part of the crime that was not a part of a lesser included offense? "}, {"speaker": "John P. Elwood", "text": " There are some courts that apply this, our rationale to lesser included's as well.   But lesser included crimes are the same crime for Blockburger purposes.   You can't be sentenced to both the greater and the lesser.

Bash", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   I'd like to start by defining exactly what the government contends the mens rea requirement is for aiding and abetting, and then give the Court an example -- two examples to show how it differs both from what Mr. Elwood is saying and how it differs from a knowledge standard.   Aiding and abetting requires an intent to facilitate or encourage the commission of an offense.   And I think that breaks down into two constituent parts: One, an intent to make some action easier or to encourage some action by the principal; two, the knowledge that the principal intends to commit a crime of which that action is a constituent part.   What Mr. Elwood is saying is something quite different.   It's that you have to intend that the crime succeed.   If that's true, all paid accomplices are out if they don't intend that the crime succeed.   If the -- if the bank robbers say, hey, can you look the other way, security guard, while we go into the bank, we'll give you a thousand dollars if you do it, that's not aiding and abetting under his theory if the security guard says, well, I only wanted a thousand dollars; I didn't care whether you ultimately succeeded in the bank.   We give an example in our brief: If the person actually gives the gun so it meets the actus reus requirement that Mr. Elwood has proposed, he actually gives the gun to somebody, not because he cares if that person commits the crime, which he knows he intends to commit, but as a favor for his friend-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " That's a very fanciful hypothetical, because the one thing the guard is going to know, that if the robber gets caught, he's in great jeopardy of -- of being caught himself and convicted.   Of course he wants the crime to succeed because he doesn't want the people to be there and being pressured by investigators or whatever to say, okay, you know, who was in on -- who was in on this with you?   So if you're -- if you're being paid for a crime, to assist in the commission of the crime, you want it to succeed. "}, {"speaker": "John F.

I mean, that sort of seems to beg the question of whether you're actually going to be liable for the gun.

And it seems to me to -- to get 10 years of your life for the government proving no more than the 48-month charge is a bit much. "}, {"speaker": "John F. Bash", "text": " It's not proving no more than the 48-month charge.   And I'll just -- as a footnote, it's 10 years only if the gun is fired.   It's 5 years if it's carried or used, and which obviously creates a much greater danger to people's lives and property if it's fired.

He knows all along that it's going to be a firearm offense.   I'm pretty sure Mr. Elwood would say: Because you took no act facilitating the gun in that case, you only sort of showed up at the end, even though you knew a gun would be used, that that's not facilitation.   So I take your point, Justice Kennedy, that in a wide swath of cases it may not matter, but I think in some cases it is going to matter.   And -- take his intent requirement.   I mean, the person that lends the gun just to be a good guy, not because he cares about the offense, I'm pretty sure he is out.

It's qualitative in the sense that the facilitation can relate to either element.   So it can relate to the gun in particular or -- and this could be the guy that set up the drug deal knowing that a gun would be involved, or set up the robbery knowing that a gun would be involved.   I think you see in the courts of appeals cases here the practical difficulties that come in because, although most court of appeals, I think eight, have technically adopted the position that you have to facilitate the gun in a direct way, if you look a the actual holdings of the cases it doesn't differ in practical application from our approach.   It's -- there is one case, I think it's Price out of the Third Circuit, where the guy may have learned of the gun -- I may have the case name wrong, but the guy learned of the gun only as the robbery was -- was taking place, but he continued to participate in the robbery while his confederate brandished the gun, he collected the money and so forth.   And as far as your question about the practical problems, I think explaining to a jury what does it mean to facilitate the gun in a specific way during a crime like that is incredibly difficult.

But this time, the guy says: Okay, you've convinced me, it's a bad idea to bring a gun, I won't bring a gun.   And so then they go out and they rob whatever they are robbing, and in the middle of it, you know -- or they do a drug transaction, and in the middle of that drug transaction the guy who said don't bring a gun looks over and he realizes that, notwithstanding the promise, his confederate did bring a gun.   But there they are, they are in the middle of their drug transaction.   So the guy, you know, they're right -- they are handing the money to each other and the guy keeps on doing it, all right?   Is -- is that enough, even though, you know, there's foreknowledge, there's acts after he -- he realizes that the guy has a gun?   Is that sufficient? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Bash", "text": " If the gun is drawn and the person continues to facilitate the drug crime or the violent crime, that is enough.

Would you want him to just say, you know, sort of like drop everything, I'm out of there?   Is that the idea? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Bash", "text": " Yeah.   Take this case.   This is an $800 marijuana deal.   It's a small-scale drug deal that happens all the time without firearms.   As Mr. Elwood says, usually this kind of deal is not done with a firearm; only 5 percent of marijuana offenses have a firearm.   Yes, if you are on that kind of small-scale deal and all of a sudden it becomes an armed offense, you do have an obligation to withdraw.   Now, of course, I think you might have a duress defense if you felt like if I withdraw I'm going to get shot, or something like that. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   I mean, I guess that's the question: Is there always a reasonable opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun in the offense that you didn't expect to be there?   And do you think that there has to be a reasonable opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time; you can just leave? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Bash", "text": " Two points on that.   First, I think a lot of that would come in through the duress defense.   I mean, if you really feel like, oh, my God, this guy has a gun and he might shoot me if I withdraw, it can give a pretty solid duress defense.   The other point I would say which is maybe a little tangential to the hypothetical, is there's a traditional doctrine of aiding and abetting law.   This is at 2.06 of the Model Penal Code.   It's in the LaFave Treatise and the Wharton Treatise, that if you countermand your assistance after you have assisted but before the crime is accomplished or completed -- for example, if your assistance was only encouraging and you start discouraging, or if you take all actions possible to prevent the crime -- for example, you assisted, you have a change of heart, you call the police to prevent the crime, you are not liable for aiding and abetting.   And I think that reflects a broader point, which is that the traditional common law contours of aiding and abetting work pretty well with the contemporary purposes and problems that this statute was designed to solve.   I mean, this is a statute about the mix of guns and drugs or guns and violence.   And I don't see why Mr. Elwood contends that if you assist one side of that equation or the other it is a different result.   I think if you assist either side of that equation, knowing that the equation is going to happen, by the principle, that is aiding and abetting.   It's aiding and abetting under the historical test, I think it's aiding and abetting under this Court's cases, and I don't see why it would be a different result here. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Bash, would you explain why in this situation the guy abetted a drug deal when there was no drug deal?   It had been thwarted.   The drugs were stolen.   They were not engaged in any attempt to sell the drugs.   That was a failed attempt.   So how is this done, abetting a drug deal, when the deal failed? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Bash", "text": " Well, of course, the prosecution's principal theory was that he was the gunman; he brought it along to facilitate his drug deal.   But assuming the theory of the facts that the gun was fired after Gonzales absconded with the drugs, I mean, I think one way to think about it is like this: Suppose that what had happened is that Gonzales had gotten ten paces, and Petitioner or Joseph had tackled him and immediately snatched the drugs back.   I don't think this Court or courts generally would expect the government to charge two counts of possession with intent to distribute for that brief period in which someone snatches possession away and you get it.   That wasn't certainly what the prosecutor thought here, and it's obviously not the issue in this case.   The only way that question comes into this case is that Mr. Elwood is trying to say that the prosecutor understood that -- that you didn't need foreknowledge of the gun.   And that's not what the prosecutor understood.   The prosecutor understood that this offense could continue for at least some period after in which the Confederates gave chase to -- to reclaim the drugs.   And that may have been a wrong theory, but no one below ever understood that you could be convicted if you didn't know of the gun until your participation ended.   That's why Petitioner never objected on that ground, and that's why, of course, we submit that it should be reviewed for plain error. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And -- and you agree that for aiding and abetting, you must -- the gun offense, you must have knowledge that the gun is being carried by the cohort. "}, {"speaker": "John F.

So it doesn't gel with his theory that, oh, I didn't know about the gun until after the shots were fired.   I mean, I don't think anyone thought that you could get a conviction because the shells were on the ground or something and you could pick them up after they were fired.   The obvious view was that he was -- the person who shot the gun -- and at minimum, I think those convictions, because there were no aiding and abetting instructions on them, show that he must have known about the gun ahead of time if he could exercise, at minimum, constructive possession over the ammunition fired from-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And what you're suggesting is that there is -- let's say a crime, two people are involved in it.   One person does almost everything.   You know, he does 90 percent of the stuff.   And the other person does just a little thing, but something, you know, that goes to the offense that helps facilitate the offense.   But it's really pretty small compared to the overall crime.   And then in addition to that, that person does not have really full-fledged intent, just has a kind of knowledge that this other person with real purpose of intent is going to bring a gun.   So -- so, you have a lesser act and a lesser intent, and notwithstanding that, you're saying that the person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his confederate. "}, {"speaker": "John F. Bash", "text": " We are saying that.

And-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I just add, what I would have thought was that the actus reus can be very small, but almost to compensate for that, you have to have full-fledged intent.

Bash", "text": " --Justice Kagan, I don't think that can be right for the examples I gave, paid accomplices that don't have a stake or the person who lends the gun to be a good guy.   And let me contrast that -- I never got to this example -- with what a pure knowledge standard would look like.   Suppose there was looting, and the defendant breaks into the -- a store to facilitate his own entry in the store to steal goods.   But he knows there's 20 people coming behind him, and he has now facilitated their entry into the store, too.   That is not aiding and abetting under our theory because he did not even bear the intent to facilitate, by which we mean the intent to make some step in another person's crime easier.   He knew it would do that, but that was incidental to an intent to facilitate his own crime.   So I do think the mens rea is significantly ratcheted up from what a pure knowledge standard would look like. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

Bash", "text": " Yes.   I think what that formulation masks is exactly what intent to facilitate means, and I think that might be part of the disagreement among the parties.

That's also the formulation in the historical sources we cite at page 47 at Footnote 10 of our brief.   It's either the intent to commit the crime yourself or knowledge that the other person has that intent.   And I don't see how it can be anything else.

And I think a reasonable person reading that would not think I helped make -- helped make the 924(c) crime succeed if I didn't even know about the gun until I was after doing -- I was done doing whatever I was going to do.   And I also point the Court to page 194, which makes clear that \u201c knowingly \u201d, in that second part of the instruction, is defined as voluntarily and intentionally.   So you certainly had to intentionally participate in the drug trafficking crime.   And that -- part of the context, as this Court has said, is also just-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Knowing that a gun would be used.   You had to intentionally participate knowing that a gun would be used. "}, {"speaker": "John F. Bash", "text": " --Basically a slight tweak, which is knowing that the principal bore the intent to use a gun.   Obviously, you can't know the future.   It's that you know that the principal bore that intent, which is a little bit different, but I think we're saying the same thing. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I -- I don't see how \u201c make the crime succeed \u201d helps you because you would say the crime that he has to help make succeed is the underlying drug offense, not the use of the firearm. "}, {"speaker": "John F. Bash", "text": " No, Mr. Chief Justice, we wouldn't say that.   This umbrella instruction applied to Count 1 and 2.   The crime you're help making succeed is 924(c).   What I was saying earlier was that, what does it mean to help make a crime succeed?   It makes -- it means intent to make one -- at least one step in that crime easier, knowing the other person bore the intent to do the crime.   And I think that's how we normally think about it.   If there's an armed robbery, and you say, well, I'll drive the getaway car, I think you would naturally say in ordinary English you intended to help make that crime succeed even if you didn't bear a specific intent with respect to the gun.   I certainly think on -- you know, if this had been objected to below, it might be a different matter with Mr. Elwood, but he did not object to this below.   He didn't -- he didn't raise this -- this wording issue even in the court of appeals.   He raised a sufficiency challenge with respect to foreknowledge.   But he -- even in his court of appeals brief, he didn't say that the instructions in this case were wrong because it said \u201c used \u201d versus \u201c would use \u201d.   So I don't think the issue is properly here, but I think it would be a sensible resolution if the Court were to remand these case-specific issues after clarifying the basic standard of aiding and abetting to the court of appeals to work through the forfeiture and waiver of harmless error and so forth.

Elwood", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   One point that I want to emphasize is a point made by Justice Kagan, which is that traditionally because the actus reus is relatively small for aiding and abetting cases, that is exactly why courts have adopted a standard of purposeful intent.   And they have said that because the act of an accomplice tends to be less harmful and tends to be more equivocal than that of the principal, that they ordinarily require purposeful intent.
