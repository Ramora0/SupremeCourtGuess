[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 15-649, Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corporation. Ms. Spinelli. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Chapter 11 provides one way to distribute estate assets to creditors on account of their prepetition claims through a confirmed plan that adheres to the code's priority scheme.   If a Chapter 11 plan can't be confirmed, the bankruptcy court can convert the case to Chapter 7, which also requires that creditors be paid in order of priority, or it can simply dismiss the case without distributing assets to creditors at all, returning all parties to their prebankruptcy position. No provision of the Bankruptcy Code permits what happened here: an order dismissing a Chapter 11 case that distributed all the estate's assets to creditors, but deliberately skipped over our clients' priority claims.

So did it bar you from suing Sun Life for a fraudulent transfer, which -- "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " It did. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It did. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " It did, Justice Sotomayor, and I think that's -- that's critical.   What this settlement did is it took away our client's right to pursue either the debtor or Sun and CIT on account of their undisputed WARN Act claims, which were in the area of $12 million. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   In the court below, I understand that the -- that you represented that if this settlement went through, that you would have -- I'm sorry -- that if -- without the settlement, you would really have nothing, because there was no money in the estate. So are you representing that your client intends to sue Sun Life? Because that's the only way to get money here. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Well, let me -- let me respond to that, Justice Sotomayor.   There are a few things that could happen if this Court reverses the order below and the case is remanded. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's fine.   Tell me which one you're going to do. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Well, that's really up to the bankruptcy court. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So what do you -- are you going to ask them to do?

So how will the trustee do that? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " The trustee would have to retain contingency counsel, and that does happen.   I was involved in a Chapter 7 case where the trustee pursued an avoidance action successfully with contingency counsel. Failing that, if the trustee decided not to do that, after the bankruptcy is over, the fraudulent-transfer claim would revest in the creditors, and our clients could then bring that claim themselves.

That's the only reason our clients have been pursuing it.   And the practical difference it makes is that on remand, they will have an opportunity to recover on account of their undisputed WARN Act claims, which, as of now, they're -- they have been deprived of.

I believe that's what -- that's the argument that we made below. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Can I ask one other -- one other thing? Something strange seems to have happened between the petition stage and the briefing stage in the case. The question that you asked us to take was whether a bankruptcy court may authorize the distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the statutory priority scheme.   And you said there's a square conflict on that issue, with the Second Circuit and the Third Circuit on one side and the Fifth Circuit on the other side. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And we took the case. But then the question that you address in your brief refers to \"structured dismissal.\" There is nothing about structured dismissal in the question that you asked us to take, and there is no conflict on the question of structured dismissal, is there? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " And, Justice Alito, we're not asking this Court to decide the question of whether structured dismissals are valid.   We did not change the substance of the question presented here. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Now, you're not asking us to decide the broad question whether there can ever be a structured dismissal.   But you are asking us to decide whether the priorities have to be followed in a structural dismissal, and unless the answer to that question follows from the answer to the question that you presented in your petition, you have changed the question that you have asked us to decide. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " We did not change the substance of the question presented.   In the petition, we had a paragraph of background explaining that this was done through a structured dismissal.   We then asked the question, does the Bankruptcy Code -- may a bankruptcy court authorize the distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the Code's priority scheme? In the brief, we condensed that a bit so that we didn't have the paragraph of background, and we said, may a structured dismissal distribute estate assets in violation of the priority scheme? There is no substantive difference there.   The authorization in this case was done through a structured dismissal. Settlement proceeds are estate assets. The basic question in this case has always been the same: Was the bankruptcy court entitled under the Bankruptcy Code to authorize this distribution of settlement proceeds, which are estate assets, in violation of priority? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Exactly.   So what forbids it? You started out by saying there is nothing in the Code that permits this kind of settlement, which in fact leaves out -- if -- it gives some money to lower-ranking creditors without giving them to your client. I think you're right.   I don't see anything permits it.   The problem: What forbids it? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " The structure of the Code forbids it, Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " The structure of the Code -- "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " If we -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- forbids it. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " If we -- the structure and the text of the Code.   If we take a step back for a moment, the way business bankruptcies work is that the debtor files a petition. That creates an estate, which includes all the debtor's property, and it also includes causes of action belonging to the estate. That estate is then held in trust, essentially for the benefit of creditors.   It is protected against creditors' claims through the automatic stay. The trustee or debtor-in-possession can dispose of estate assets only in accordance with strict limitations and subject to the bankruptcy court's supervision.   And at the end of the case, those assets are distributed to creditors through a confirmed Chapter 11 plan, which requires adherence to priority; or, failing that, the case can be converted to Chapter 7, in which case the assets are also distributed in accordance with priority. Those careful, reticulated mechanisms for the distribution of estate assets foreclose any inference that Congress intended to allow courts to disregard them and create a different method for distributing assets that's not mentioned anywhere in the Code that violates that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why do you think -- "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " -- backbone priority scheme. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why do you think, though, it isn't mentioned someplace in the Code? I mean, did Congress just not think that this might happen? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " No, Justice Kagan.   I think the reason that Chapter 11 doesn't expressly apply the priority rules to settlements is that settlements are not intended to be a method of distributing estate assets.   I think it's very important to keep those two things distinct.   On the one hand, we have a settlement of a cause of action belonging to the estate.   The estate relinquishes its rights in return for money, and money goes into the estate.   That is one thing. Separately, there is a distribution of all of the assets in the estate, including the proceeds of the settlement.   And that is done in Chapter 11 through a Chapter 11 plan. So Congress would not have specified that priority applies to settlements, because settlements are not a means for distribution of estate assets. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " There can -- "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Only the plan does that. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " There can be a dismissal. There are three things.   Two are covered, Chapter 7 and Chapter 11.   But this is a dismissal, which means, as I understand it, you -- you return to the preexisting situation. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But -- but now you're saying the -- there are assets, and the Court has to do something about the distribution of those assets. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Correct -- correct, Justice Ginsburg.   The -- there are -- there are two methods for distributing estate assets contemplated by the corporate provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, either a Chapter 11 plan or the Chapter 7 distribution set out in Section 726, both of which require adherence to priority. A case can also be dismissed.   In that case, there is no distribution of estate assets at all. That's not contemplated in conjunction with a dismissal. Rather, the parties are returned to their prebankruptcy positions, and the bankruptcy -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But the -- but the Code does say, 349, \"unless the Court, for cause, orders otherwise.\" Can you tell us how -- how that is -- what -- what was the likely purpose for that? Because -- "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Justice Kennedy, what the -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " -- from the very literal standpoint, it does cover what the Respondents' position is -- is -- is here.   Why is it inapplicable and why is -- does it fall in face of the overall description that you just gave to Justice Ginsburg? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Justice Kennedy, what the legislative history tells us is that the \"for cause\" provision in Section 349(b) was intended to protect parties who took actions in reliance on the bankruptcy. And I think it's important to look -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Can you give me an example? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " I can.   So one case that's cited in our briefs is In re Wiese, which is a Seventh Circuit case.   In that case, there was a plan that had been confirmed that -- in which the debtors released their claim against the bank that had lent them money in return for the bank's releasing its lien on some cash that they had.   That cash was then disbursed and couldn't be gotten back. The debtors then dismissed their case shortly after the plan was confirmed, and the Seventh Circuit said this was an appropriate case in which to use the \"for cause\" provision.   Typically, the release that occurred in the plan would be undone, but in order to avoid unfairness to the bank, which had taken -- which had taken action in reliance on the plan, the Court was not going to do that.   Instead, it was going to hold the debtors to their release. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well -- well, if -- if fairness is -- is the -- the -- the basis for the for cause order, the Respondent will say, well, this is fair, because most creditors were paid, so whether you -- you can hear the arguments. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I mean, we just talk about fairness.   That's -- that's -- that's different from the careful answer you gave to Justice Ginsburg a -- about the prior scheme. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Yes, Justice Kennedy. Section 349(b) doesn't create that kind of gaping hole in the scheme I just described.   It's important to understand what it actually does.   I think it's a relatively limited provision. So Section 349 says that -- that the default when a bankruptcy case is dismissed is that certain transactions that occurred during the case, such as avoidance actions, get unwound, liens that have been voided are reinstated, and property remaining in the estate is returned to its prebankruptcy owner.   In other words, the bankruptcy is undone as far as possible. The cause exception is an exception to that. So what the cause exception permits a bankruptcy court to do is to maintain the status quo at the time of dismissal when there is good reason to do so.   And the typical good reason would be reliance by a party on something that happened during the bankruptcy case.   But Section -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " But Section 349(b) doesn't then permit the court to go beyond that and do something that's not contemplated in conjunction with a dismissal at all, but doesn't involve maintaining the status quo, but involves actually distributing assets to creditors in violation of the priority scheme. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You -- you said that that reading was supported in the legislative history, if I understood you correctly.   What -- what is the nature of that legislative history? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " The legislative history essentially -- there's not a lot of it, but what it essentially says is the bankruptcy courts should use that provision, the cause provision -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I mean, I -- where is that? In -- in the -- in the -- a Senate Report? What? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " I apologize, Your Honor.   I believe -- we -- we cited it in our brief.   And I believe it is in the House -- the 1977 House Report. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " May I ask, Ms. Spinelli, just quickly: What's the scope of the holding that you would like us to issue? I suppose this comes back to Justice Alito's question of what's actually on the table. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " All settlements? All structured dismissals? Just this particular kind? And if just this particular kind, how would you characterize it? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " What we think this Court should hold is that settlement proceeds cannot be distributed in violation of priority.   I mean, a -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So a settlement that is a -- a -- that -- that distributes protest -- proceeds. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Correct.   But it -- to be more specific, the -- the order that was entered here, we believe, would -- could never be lawful, regardless of the stage of the case at which it was entered. So we are not saying this order would only -- this order is only unlawful because it was part of a structured dismissal.   We are saying it's unlawful because it took estate assets and distributed them in violation of priority. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You're saying that -- that there can never be a distribution of estate assets except in compliance with the priorities? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " No.   There is one -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " One which -- that's not what you just said? "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " That -- well, let me -- let me qualify what I just said, then. There is one express exception in the code -- that's Section 510 -- provides that claims can be subordinated to other claims under the principles of equitable subordination, which, as this Court said in Noland, are limited to a creditor's bad behavior that harms the estate. There are also some practices that occur in bankruptcy court that -- whose validity I don't think this Court needs to reach.   For instance, critical vendor orders are an example.   Courts will sometimes permit, on the first day of a case, a debtor to pay certain vendors on account of their prepetition claims, because doing so is necessary to the debtors maintaining a going concern and reorganizing and coming out the other end a viable business.   That's based on a doctrine that goes back many, many years before the Bankruptcy Code called the Doctrine of Necessity.   And the reasoning behind that is because a going concern is worth so much more than the debtor's assets liquidated piecemeal.   That creates the possibility of a greater recovery for creditors higher up the priority chain. What happened here is precisely the opposite.   There was no possibility of reorganization. This was a naked priority violation for its own sake, and whatever one thinks about critical vendor orders, what happened here, taking value from senior creditors and giving it to junior creditors for its own sake, is not permitted. May I reserve? Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start, if I could, with Justice Kagan's last question, which is: What would we like the Court to hold in this case? We think the Court should hold that a bankruptcy court can never resolve a bankruptcy by ordering the distribution of estate assets in a manner that violates the Code's detailed priority system without the consent of the impaired priority claimholder. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You don't even have the extraordinary circumstances exception? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " No, we don't -- I mean, basically, the extraordinary circumstances exception that the Third Circuit wanted to apply would bring in any case that is administratively insolvent, and that's a large proportion of business bankruptcies. That kind of exception also gives parties the -- the wrong incentive to make essentially self-serving assertions about what they would or would not do if the particular disposition that they desire is not approved. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " You'd presumably qualify that with the statutory provision that was just mentioned, and my guess was you want to qualify that as well with the -- with this emergency creditor, you know, where you're going to sink the -- the person who has a prepetition was just discussed. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Well, the prepetition distributions that were just discussed, I think that -- that does present a separate question that we think -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah.   All right.   All -- that's all I wanted to know.   You don't want a holding here that is going to knock that out. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Right, but -- so I said that a -- a court could not resolve a case by ordering the distribution of assets that would violate their priority scheme. Now, in our view, \"the priority scheme\" is sort of a broad term that includes both equitable subordination law, subordination principles, which are not applicable here, and also includes the ability of the priority claimholder to consent to impairment of its rights. I think it's important to keep in mind here that the priority claimholders here, Petitioners did not settle.   This is not a case where the people whose rights were impaired agreed to it, and you can't have -- you can't call a settlement basically the agreement of other parties whose rights were not impaired and who, in fact, benefited from the impairment of the Petitioners' rights. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What would be your principal basis for distinguishing the exception that Ms. Spinelli outlined at the end of her argument from what happened here? I thought your argument was that the priority scheme applies to everything that happens in a Chapter 7 and a Chapter 11. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Yes.   So in our view, prepetition distributions in Chapter 11 that violate the priority scheme are not permissible under any circumstances unless there is consent of the impaired priority claimholder.   And so critical vendor orders, if they are done over the objection of the -- of the claimholder who skipped, we think those are not permissible. Now, most of the time those sort of first order distributions happen in a plane of reorganization, not in a plane of -- in a case of reorganization, not a liquidation case.   They happen with the consent of the senior claimholders, and they are generally premised on a -- on a prediction that -- that allowing that kind of distribution will ultimately result in every creditor getting more money at the end of the day.   So none of those factors apply here. You didn't have consent.   This is not an ongoing concern, and there is certainly no finding that everybody is going to get more money at the end of the day. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Ms. Harrington -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, if I could just -- go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Please. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " There is another logically prior question.   And I don't know what you -- what do you think we should do with the question of whether the bankruptcy court has to approve settlements at all? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " We think that -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " There is nothing in the Code that says that they have to. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " So we think that -- that a bankruptcy court does have to approve a settlement that disposes of a claim held by the estate or asserted against the estate.   We don't think this Court needs to reach that question in this case if it doesn't want to, because we think it's very clear that a -- what a settlement cannot do is provide for the distribution of estate assets. I think it's important to remember, State assets don't belong to the debtor, and they don't belong to a subset of creditors.   They belong to the estate. And so the Code provides only specific ways that those assets can be distributed.   In Chapter 11, that's through a plan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Just to make sure I understand the scope of what you're saying we should decide: Would that also knock out the thing that was approved in Iridium itself? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Yes, we think it would.   If you limit your holding to the resolution of the case, then it would not, because Iridium did not involve the resolution of the case. We think the principle applies more broadly to prepetition and distributions as well, when you don't have consent.   But if the course -- if the Court prefers not to, it doesn't need to reach that question in this case. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So you don't agree completely with Judge Scirica's dissent? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " We don't.   I mean, I would point out, again, that he is a -- he is a dissenter in this case, and so he -- even he didn't think that this case would -- would qualify, but we -- we don't think there is anything in the -- in the Code that would allow parties to override the priority claimholders' assertion of their rights. Now, it's important to keep in mind that Chapter 11 is very -- is very flexible.   It allows basically any type of plan to be confirmed if all the parties can agree on the terms of a plan.   That was the innovation in Chapter 11 in 1978.   It didn't exist in the Bankruptcy Act, and I think that sort of clearly expresses Congress' intent that parties, if they can come to an agreement that deviates from sort of the usual course, then they should do it and that that -- that agreement should be memorialized in a plan, not in some other disposition. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Can you tell me, just as a matter of practice, of practice and experience, do priority creditors in a settlement, structured settlement agreements, often allow junior creditors to -- to receive something? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Well, they often do in plans.   In -- in our -- in our experience, when there is a structured dismissal like the kind at issue here, usually those -- the parties turn to that kind of disposition, because they can't obtain the consent of the parties that they would need to get a plan confirmed.   And so basically what you have is an agreement that is, in essence, an unconfirmable plan. And instead of trying to get that confirmed, they call it a structured dismissal to override the consent of the priority claimholders. And so in those cases, no, but -- but -- but I think priority claimholders all the time agree to an impairment of their rights, and, in fact, the priority claimholders, other than Petitioners who were paid in this case, agreed to take, you know, some cents on the dollar like the tax claimholders and -- and the administrative expenses. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Do you believe that the question presented here did not address the issue before us? Do you see a difference between the question presented that talked about the absolute priority rule as it relates to settlement proceeds and the \"structured dismissal\" here. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " I don't think so.   I think the -- the change in wording was meant to sort of give -- give the particular context that -- that the question arises in this case.   And if any -- if there is any difference, it's just a narrower sort of set of what the law -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, I -- I -- it goes to a more fundamental question, which is, is there a difference or in our ruling whether we say no settlement proceeds can be distributed in violation of the absolute priority rule from a statement that no dismissal, structured dismissal, can be entered in violation of the absolute priority rule. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " I think the -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I do think there is a difference. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Well, I think the -- your first formulation is a little bit broader than the second formulation.   And then, like I said, we think the rule would apply also to preplanned -- preplanned dispositions of estate assets. If you wanted to limit your holding just to sort of the resolution of a case in a way that is kind of a substitute for a plan, then I think you could just say a structured dismissal can't authorize the distribution of estate assets. But I'd like to, again, sort of distinguish the settlement of the claim from the distribution of estate assets.   The two things were put together in this case, and they are put together throughout Respondents' brief.   But they are really separate things.   There's nothing in the Code that would authorize a debtor or some subset of creditors to distribute estate assets. They don't get -- they don't have any say in how estate assets are distributed.   The Code and Congress have the say in that. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, how can you have a -- a settlement if it can't be carried out? I mean, if you -- you're saying one thing is the settlement, and that's okay.   And the other thing is the distribution of the assets, but that's what the settlement provides for. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Well, what the settlement should provide for is basically a liquidation of a claim.   And so if you have a claim by the estate against a third party, here a creditor, you basically reduce that claim to a dollar amount, and those dollars become property of the estate. If you have a settlement of a claim that's asserted by a creditor against the estate, then it's the same kind of thing: You sort of liquidate the claim, you reduce it to a dollar amount, and that becomes the claim against the estate held by the creditor.   But nothing in the Code would authorize -- and I think it's a -- it would be a violation of the priority system and generally of the system that distributes estate assets to have parties agree on the side of how estate assets should be distributed.   Those estate assets are not the property of the debtor once the bankruptcy starts. They're not the property of the creditors.   And so you really need to look to the Code provisions to see how estate assets should be distributed.   In -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What -- "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What is your response to the argument that your argument regarding Section 103(a) makes the provisions that specifically make the priorities applicable in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 superfluous? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Well, it doesn't, because if you look at those provisions, and one of them is Section 1129(a)(9), and then it's Section, I think, 726 in Chapter 7, they don't just say Section 507 priority scheme applies.   They also specify exceptions, and they specify the manner in which it applies. And so in Section 1129(a)(9), it says, priority claimholders can agree to an impairment of their rights.   That exception is not included in Section 7 -- in the -- in the Chapter 7 analog.   It also says -- tells you what it means to pay a priority claimholder either through cash or through deferred cash payments.   Depending on the type of 507 claim, the -- the parties have a right to demand one or the other. And so there is more to it than just saying, oh, Section 507 applies.   It tells you how it applies and in what circumstances. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So those are just exception provisions? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E.

And so some priority claimholders, I guess, can demand cash on the date of confirmation; others have to agree in some circumstances to deferred cash payments.   And so there is definitely more content to. In the Chapter 7 context, it also tells you which type of 507 claims are allowed based on when the associated proof of claim was filed.   So those -- in both cases, they kind of -- they add more substance than the Respondents would have you believe. I'd just like to point out that Congress enacted the priority scheme precisely to prohibit the kind of collusive looking agreements that happened here, where you have high-priority and low-priority creditors kind of squeezing out the middle creditors.   And the Court should not allow parties to make an end run around that prohibition by just scrapping the main settlement or -- or structured dismissal on what is really, in essence, an unconfirmable plan. We think that's what happened here.   The parties -- some of the parties reached an agreement. The agreement couldn't be confirmed as a plan because it abrogated the rights of priority claimholders and they did not consent. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.

The fact that there's no provision for approving settlements qua settlements doesn't mean -- which there had been under the old regime -- doesn't mean that when you have a settlement that actually disposes of estate assets, like this settlement did, that that disposition of estate assets is not subject to the traditional Rule 363(b) review by the Court of any use, sale, or lease.

But this case explains exactly why Iridium said there may be some rare exceptions, because once you are in this more discretionary 363(b) land, the -- the priority scheme is going to be the most important. This case is a great example, Your Honor, because in this case we have findings that there could be no confirmable Chapter 11 plan because the estate was administratively insolvent. So the Code system that you just described, the waterfall of priorities, would not apply in Chapter 11 because there was no way to go to a Chapter 11 plan. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But -- but I'm sure it often happens that there can be no confirmable plan because the creditors -- priority creditors are not going to concede.

Then the Court also analyzed, well, the alternative, then, is conversion to Chapter 7, and we have findings there, too, that any conversion to a Chapter 7 liquidation, in fact, the estate asset -- there would be no settlement there, because at that point, once you've gone through the expense and delay of converting to Chapter 7, it wouldn't make sense to settle.   That's -- there's many reasons that you might want to -- be willing to settle at the beginning of the case, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But -- but this seems -- but the essence of the case is not really an objection to approval of the settlement; it's the objection of the distribution of the assets. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Absolutely.   And that's -- I think that's so critical, Your Honor, and -- and their objection would actually completely come back to bite them because there is no legal difference between a distribution of assets on the first day where they recovered $6 million in this case in their prepetition wage and benefit claims. That's why, to go back to Justice Alito's question earlier, it was not a slip of the pen that led them to change their question presented from the question -- from the petition to the merits brief.   They know perfectly well that a rule that the absolute priority rule applies to every distribution of assets would have creamed the workers in this case and would in future cases, because such workers are often the beneficiaries of these first day orders that pay -- that pay wage and benefit claims, that pay critical vendor orders. Once you're talking about a world, as they seem to be suggesting, that all preplan distributions of assets are subject to the absolute priority rule -- that's not in the Code.   That's the gist -- that's the crux of the dispute here.   That was a circuit split that this Court granted cert to -- to resolve. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I thought they -- I thought they had a priority at the initial stage that required them to be paid the $6 million that you're talking about. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " They were not.   There were people above them in the chain.   There were administrative creditors.   There were secure -- they did not have the top priority at that point, and that was not subject to the priority system. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But they had the priority ahead of the unsecured general creditors that did get $1.7 million.   What they are saying is that under the priorities, that belonged to us, not creditors who were lower down. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Correct.   And I think that there was -- that there was a finding here that, in fact, the alternative to this settlement was not a settlement where they actually would have -- was not a Chapter 11 plan because they would have recovered nothing in a Chapter 11 plan because there could have been no Chapter 11 plan.   It was not confirmable. And in conversion to Chapter 7, they wouldn't have gotten anything either, because all the money would have gone to the secured creditor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But that's -- I see that point, which you've made several times, is a very good point.   I -- clarify a basic misunderstanding on my part.   What's a structured settlement?

Breyer", "text": " Why not just call it a settlement? "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " I think you could.   And I think in that -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

"}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And as long as you give the majority to him, okay, then you can give the rest to the others. All right.   Now, that would seem to be a possibility at least from your argument in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Your Honor, I think what you are saying or the -- the point that you're getting to can be resolved through the traditional 363(b) analysis, which allows for play in the joints, unlike their unyielding and absolute -- absolute priority rule. Under you're hypothetical, Your Honor, there would be money there.   And in that case, it looks like that would be an evasion of -- there could be a plan there. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " By the way, if you want me to, I will make up my hypothetical so that giving half the gold to this person is just as wonderful as you would like, and I will also change the hypothetical around, if you could do or I could do, so that not giving the money to this person would be just terrible.

I think that is the lesson of Iridium and this case.   The Third Circuit said as a general matter, if -- if the creditors were to come together and say, you know, we really just don't like this one creditor, even though that person has a high priority. We're going to structure this so that that person gets disfavored. Well, under the 363(b) analysis, if that person would have actually have had an alternative where they recovered something -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Let me ask you -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " -- that would be a problem. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- Mr. Ernest, sort of a similar question.   You -- here's two different kinds of bankruptcy schemes.   One scheme just says every time you distribute assets, you have to follow the following order: one, two, three, four, five. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That's -- and that's it. You just have to follow that order. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That's one Bankruptcy Code. Here's another Bankruptcy Code: It says presumptively, you have to follow one, two, three, four, five, but if there is a Pareto-superior solution, in other words, a solution in which some people are made off and nobody -- in which some people are -- get better outcomes and nobody gets a worse outcome -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Yep. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- if there is such a solution, you can go with that.   And that might be a completely sensible bankruptcy provision -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- for Congress to have enacted. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The question is whether Congress did enact it and what you can point to in the Bankruptcy Code that suggests that the continual statement that it's just one, two, three, four, five is subject to a kind of equitable exception for Pareto-superior outcomes. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Yes.   I can -- I can exactly answer that question.   The line that Congress drew in the Code is the absolute priority rule with its -- with its specific one, two, three, four, five that apply as a matter of law and is unyielding, applies to plans.   When you are not in the world of plans, you are in the world of 363(b), which has play in the joints.   And so the Pareto optimality that you just said, Your Honor, is something that is appropriate in a 363(b) analysis. Now, as the Second Circuit pointed out in Iridium and the Third Circuit pointed out here, a critical consideration in that discretionary analysis is to make sure it is not being done for the purpose of evading what would otherwise be something that could proceed to the stage where Congress made the absolute priority rule applicable. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But I don't understand how you get to an extraordinary circumstance in that -- in this situation.   It seems to me that wanting to exclude the claims of one or more creditors is the ordinary situation.   Every junior creditor wants money. They're happy to exclude anybody they can -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- or anybody who will concede to doing it. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how do you protect the excluded creditor from being preyed on by one of the other creditors? We already know the junior creditors have a self-interest. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Absolutely, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The senior creditors have -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Yes.

"}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " In that 363(b) world, Your Honor, that governs the use, sale and lease of assets, when a court looks at that, a court can say, is the creditor who is claiming that he or she or it is being unfairly squeezed out, in your hypothetical, can show that there is some mechanism under which that person would otherwise, absent the settlement or the disposition of assets that is -- is contemplated at issue before the Court, would actually make off better. The critical problem here is that there were findings -- there was a hearing in the bankruptcy court on this.   It went up to the district court in review and then to the Third Circuit.   And there were findings. The findings were -- and these were critical -- that there could have been no proceeding to a Chapter 11 confirmation.   So the idea that this would have proceeded to a place where the -- the person squeezed out in your hypothetical would have actually recovered something in Chapter 11 -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Mr. Landau -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " -- is counterfactual. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, you might be right or you might be wrong about that.   Let's just assume that you are right, that -- that this is one of these extraordinary circumstances in which some people can be made better off and nobody will be made worse off. Still the question is, where is the authorization for that in the Bankruptcy Code? Because that's like a big principle.   I mean -- and I think we would have known about it if that's the way bankruptcy proceedings were supposed to go.   And -- and you suggest while it's in this \"for cause\" language, but this \"for cause\" language, I mean, this is a pretty specific provision that we're talking about. What it says is that when you can't reach a plan and the case has to be dismissed, this is attached to a provision that says everything has to be rolled back. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and this says, well, not -- you know, maybe, if there is a good reason, not everything has to be -- "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- rolled back to exactly the way it was. But that's a really different kind of provision than saying, in courts, you get to decide or -- or -- or parties, really, you get to decide, and then courts get to -- get to approve an outcome of a bankruptcy proceeding that does not follow the usual priority rules just because these particular parties, not all of them, but these particular parties think it will make some people better off without making other peoples worse off. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Well, the key point is 363(b). That is the general provision that requires bankruptcy courts to review the use, sale, or lease of assets. When you have -- what -- what they are objecting to here in this settlement is the fact not only that it brings money in, but that it actually then distributes money to different people in a way that they say doesn't comply with the absolute priority rule.   So it's the 363(b) discretion.   That is the standard about best interests of the estate.   It's been phrased various ways; that -- that's really a judicial gloss in the language of the statute, and that's probably -- you know, the absolute contours of 363(b) are not really within the question presented here. The question presented here really is: Are we in a world where there is any discretion at all, versus a world where the absolute priority rule applies by its terms? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, this 363(b) -- is there -- I mean, this -- you would -- they say -- you're just saying they did it the wrong way when they reached the settlement; then this -- the -- the Petitioners here should have gone to the bankruptcy judge and said, Judge, you know, there is an odd thing about this settlement.   They're not only paying in $3 million or whatever, but they want to tell you how to distribute it. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " And they -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

Again, the -- now we are talking about the means for terminating Chapter 11 plans, which is a little bit different than the question presented, which is all about the distribution of assets.

Chapter -- there are specific findings here that Chapter 7 conversion made no sense because the -- the trustee would -- the -- the estate did not have the money to pursue the claim on its own and nobody would bring this case on a contingency basis. Now, the -- the -- the Petitioners here were participating at that hearing in the bankruptcy court where this was done.   They didn't raise their hands and say, hey, we'd be willing to pursue this on a contingency basis, which is why it's somewhat farfetched, to say the least, that they're now suggesting that theoretically well, they -- they were deprived of this opportunity to pursue this claim outside of bankruptcy.

I think the fundamental point here is we're really talking about a rule where they're saying the absolute priority rule in flexibly and invariably applies even before a plan. Our position, on the other hand, is that the use/sale of assets at any point before the plan is governed by 363(b)   There are -- that's a discretionary regime.   And as the Second Circuit said in Iridium and the Third Circuit said here, it is absolutely critical to look at making sure that it's not an evasion of the plan. But -- but -- but the question that this Court was asked to resolve is, is it the -- the rigid and unyielding absolute priority rule or the 363(b)? And the Code answers this question.   And -- and so I think in this case that the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What the Code in 363(b) says is the trustee can sell a suit.   Okay? That's what it says.

So again, it goes to, can you -- what are the constraints on using the estate assets?

To say we want to be super careful is not to say -- is just to say that the Fifth Circuit overstated it by saying you can never do it.   In other words, the Fifth Circuit has an absolute bright-line rule.   We don't care how Pareto-optimal -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " -- this is. And I think the basic point was made by the bankruptcy court here.   The Bankruptcy Code is not a suicide pact.   So if, in fact, you have a situation where the settlement or -- and the distribution proposed makes others better without making these folks worse off, there is nothing in the Code that prohibits that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher Landau", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Two minutes, Ms. Spinelli. "}, {"speaker": "Danielle Spinelli", "text": " Respondents' position fails because Section 363(b) is not a means of distributing estate assets.   The -- the 363(b) discretion that Mr. Landau referred to is discretion to approve a settlement or a sale of an estate asset, not to distribute the settlement or sale proceeds in violation of priority. Assets are distributed under Chapter 11 through a Chapter 11 plan.   That's it.   And our fundamental point here is that those assets cannot be distributed on account of prepetition claims in violation of priority. To the extent there is a potential exception for the Doctrine of Necessity, that's hotly disputed. Courts disagree about whether that exception exists. And that's not an issue this Court needs to resolve because the Doctrine of Necessity, by its nature, is designed for situations in which a payment to prepetition creditors is necessary to the reorganization of the debtor.   There is no dispute that that wasn't the case here.   And as for our first-day order paying the wages of the drivers, that was consented to, and no one is saying that you're not allowed to consent to a priority violation. The only point we are making about structured dismissals is that there is no superpower associated with structured dismissals that provides for an exception to that general rule that one cannot distribute estate property on account of prepetition claims in violation of priority. Respondents' rule would wreak havoc on the basic process of bankruptcy.   If debtors could distribute estate property to creditors at any time without regard to the priority scheme before a plan, there wouldn't be much left of the scheme.   Debtors could simply reach a deal with junior creditors and distribute property leaving inadequate resources to pay senior creditors. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
