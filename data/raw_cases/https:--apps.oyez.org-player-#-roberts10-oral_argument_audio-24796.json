[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1201, Thacker versus the Tennessee Valley Authority. Mr. Rouse. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress created the Tennessee Valley Authority as a corporation that could sue and be sued.   The TVA Act states: Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Act, the corporation may sue and be sued in its corporate name. Nothing in the TVA Act specifically provides the exception that the TVA now urges, immunity for what it calls discretionary work. And for new -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry.   Are you denouncing the existence of a core government activity not being immunized? Whether to place a dam or not? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " No, this -- this -- there's two totally separate things.   Our -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, they're basically the same, which is how far does -- if you recognize some core government functions performed by the TVA, how far does that immunity go? Isn't that the question before us? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I -- I think so, but I -- in -- in this circumstance is -- the conduct at issue is raising a power line out of the water, replacing an electrical conductor.   Whatever might be said about deciding where to put a dam or how to -- to manage the flow of the Tennessee River and to change its course or anything like that, it's -- this conduct just does not implicate that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I suppose it depends at what level of generality you describe the conduct.   Perhaps you're right if you talk about a particular, you know, cable at a particular place, but if you decide -- if you describe the -- what is at issue is regulating safety along the waterway, then maybe it starts to sound like -- like more the exceptions that were talked about in Burr? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " And that may and would -- and I think those exceptions would certainly implicate the Federal Tort Claims Act and the discretionary -- discretionary immunity there. But, under Burr, I think the -- the question begins with the presumption that -- that Congress has taken this entity, it has created it; it has not made it a new executive department, but it has said it can sue and be sued in its own name.   It has cast it aside and said it can fend for itself.   We're allowing it to do its own work.   We'll give it some powers, but we're going to withhold others. And so there's got to be some deference to Congress that Congress took these steps.   And to just say, well, it performs some functions, it's governmental, and you start making that distinction is the exact error that we think that the lower courts made here. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " How do you think this is supposed to work? If we just -- if -- if the court just applies Burr, how is -- how is the court supposed to proceed in determining whether there is immunity? Look at the -- make a case-by-case determination whether the particular claim in that case falls within the -- the two categories set out in Burr, so is it consistent with the statutory and constitutional scheme, or, more to the point, does -- is it necessary to have immunity to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " So under -- I think under the test that at least the second prong -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " -- certainly looks at the specific conduct at issue, and it says, what proof do you have that immunity here is needed? It must -- it must be clearly shown that it is necessary to prevent some grave interference with the performance of a governmental function. Not just it may be tougher, it may be harder, or you may have to pay normal tort damages, but what grave interference is present here? Whereas -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You think this is -- this is to be done a case-by-case basis or categorical basis? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I think that under the second prong, a -- a case-by-case basis is going to be the more usual result, but, under the first prong, you're looking at, is this the type of suit that is consistent or inconsistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme? In this circumstance, there's no real argument that this case is inconsistent with the statutory scheme.   There's no doubt that liability here will somehow mean the TVA can't do its other functions or anything like that. It's not -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I guess there is some -- I guess there is some argument on the other side, and I take it that a main argument that registered in my mind was where Justice Sotomayor started out.   And you reply to that and say let's do it on a case-by-case basis. Well, subsequent to Burr, Congress enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act.   Under -- it contains a discretionary exemption.   And there's a well-worked-out body of jurisprudence. And so what you're asking us to do is to have each court decide each thing that the TVA and probably 100 other government agencies with a sue-and-be-sued clause does and decide case by case, which is what you said, whether it does or does not fall within the discretionary exemption. That seems to me a very complex, difficult decision that could end up with probably a hundred cases before this Court deciding what this different thing, serving the same purpose, does. Now that, I think, is at least one argument that I'd like to hear your response to. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " The Burr test, we believe, is actually much easier to look at for the judiciary than the Federal Tort Claims Act test.   The Federal Tort Claims Act test looks at the conduct at issue, whether -- it looks at statutes and internal policies, and then it asks the court to say, is this the type of conduct that is susceptible to policy analysis? Is this what -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " -- that Congress was trying to protect under the FTCA? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And I take it if we apply Burr, we have to go case by case and decide whether, for other reasons, it was plainly the purpose of Congress to use sue-and-be-sued clause in a narrow sense.   And we have to decide just what you said, case by case. So my question is not whether case by case, but do you do that without reference to the well-worked-out body of discretionary exception law under the FTCA? That's the point. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I mean, you'll -- you're saying don't use the FTCA; use Burr. And I want to know, is that a big difference? And if that is a big difference, is it case by case? And that's where my question came from. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " It is a big difference, totally separate.   And the Burr test is much easier for the judiciary in its traditional role of -- of looking at things that -- what has Congress enacted? Under the first -- under the first prong of Burr, you're just looking at whether the type of suit -- don't have to look anything further than the complaint.   What is the challenged conduct? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And Burr -- look, I'll say -- try it once more.   We started with Justice Sotomayor.   They build dams.   Well, somebody's hurt during the building of a dam. There are farmers, their land is flooded by the dam, their crops might be destroyed.   There are many kinds of crops.   There are many ways of building dams.   There are many arguments for and against deciding whether there's a dam. Okay? What do you want us to do? Look to the FTCA or something different? That's the question that I think you were beginning with. And it seemed -- I wanted to follow up because that seems the central issue in the case to me. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " We should look at Burr. And under Burr, the presumption begins with the fact that Congress has launched this entity, that it has -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, let -- let me phrase it slightly differently.   Is your argument based on the sue-to-be -- permission to sue and be sued clause, or is it welded in -- in part in the fact that the TVA was excluded from the FTCA? I think, once you start with that it was excluded, then we have to figure out what applies, right? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And why we should keep the FTCA in when Congress told us not to. Correct? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Well -- correct.   The Federal Tort Claims Act just does not apply. The TVA is exempted. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There's three entities that were excluded from the FTCA. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how much does your argument rely on the sue-to-be-sued clause or -- or the exclusion of the TVA? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Well, it's a little of both and it's this Court's precedent.   In -- in Meyer in 1994 -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So, if it's -- if it's this Court's precedent, then give us a reason addressing Justice Breyer's point, which is the Burr analysis, since, by definition, it has to involve a case-by-case analysis. I think, but I'm not sure, were you saying that so does the discretionary -- "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Correct.   The lawsuit is there.   The complaint is there.   And so under -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So both of them require a case-by-case analysis? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " They're both going to require a case-by-case basis. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I think what Justice Breyer is saying -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, that's true -- please. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry, that the discretionary policy exemption is less complex than the Burr rule. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I believe that at least where the judiciary is concerned it's -- it -- it's -- it might be more complex in some ways but less complex in other ways.   It might be more complex in that it requires you to take a much deeper look into the facts of the case than Burr. Burr is just looking at is this the type of suit that was not contemplated by the statute.   And so then you look at the statute. You don't have to do anything other than the complaint. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's on step 1. But step 2? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " That's on step 1.   On step 2, yeah, there -- there needs to be a showing. And the idea is that Congress has launched this entity out.   It has made it sueable.   And so now it has the proof to show -- it has the burden to submit proof to show that immunity is needed here. And we don't have that here. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   But that makes it sound, Mr. Rouse, and I think this is what everybody is getting to, is that you're saying in most cases we have the discretionary function exception.   And here, with respect to the TVA or other entities like the TVA, we're essentially going to have a discretionary function exception light. We're going to have something where we look to the same concerns, the same animating purposes, but we just have a higher bar.   Is that what we're doing, or is it a different inquiry in kind? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " It is a different inquiry in kind. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, that's what I'm not getting, because if you, again, focus, as Justice Sotomayor said, on the question of intrusion, impedement of -- of government operations, it seems like the same inquiry, just a higher standard -- "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- a higher bar. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " -- the Federal Tort Claims Act was by Congress.   Congress has never -- this Court, at least under the Federal Tort Claims Act, has never said, as a matter of separation of powers, the discretionary function exception in the Federal Tort Claims Act exists in all areas of law.   It's never said that. It actually -- the Court used very specific language in saying, in Varig Airlines, which my friends at the TVA try to draw so many distinctions -- or so many lessons from, the Court in there said Congress -- Congress wished to prevent judicial second-guessing. And by fashioning an exception, Congress took steps to handicap -- to protect the handicap of efficient government operations. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Here's what bothers me about this case, and I'll ask the same question, if I have a chance, to the Assistant to the Solicitor General. The -- the TVA does some things that are purely governmental and it does some things that are pretty much purely commercial.   It's a hybrid entity. As to the -- as to its commercial activities, it's hard to see why a -- a business should be exempt from tort liability for every discretionary business decision that the business makes. But, as to its governmental activities, it's kind of hard to see why the regime should be different from the regime under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Now, under Burr, the Court is supposed to ask, you say, whether it interferes with a governmental function, but I'm not quite sure what is the governmental function when you're talking about a hybrid entity like that.   Does it mean something that only the government can do? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " No.   I mean, the case we're talking about here involves something contractors could do.   It's inherent work a day labor.   But, under -- under Burr, the -- the governmental function, I believe, it is -- it is -- it takes into higher account -- it just doesn't concern that.   It concerns that the TVA serves much larger purposes in that it can do things and things can be protected under Burr, such as, you know, its -- its economic and its regulatory or policy decisions. All of those things can be protected under Burr. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You see, I think, Mr. Rouse, what Justice Alito may be offering you is a way out of the difficulty of some of these questions, is that, with respect to some of the TVA's functions, we shouldn't be applying something that's sort of like the discretionary function exception but not really like the discretionary function exception. Rather, we should be applying nothing. With respect to the commercial functions of the TVA, the TVA ought to be treated just like any other corporate entity. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " We absolutely think that's the case here.   This is -- this -- the TVA is not mandated to do any of the work that was involved here.   This is a choice that it makes. And it is a choice that it makes, and it accomplishes that goal without any funding or appropriations from Congress.   Its -- all of its activities are completely self-funded. And it just doesn't concern -- the federal government is just not concerned with it at this point. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Part -- "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Maybe -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Maybe in -- in historical -- in the Depression Era times, in the Tennessee Valley, during that point in time, but now it is doing all of the stuff on its own, without help, without anything like that, and it's making profit, profit that it's not turning back over to the U.S. Treasury. It's operating just as a private corporation. And so we absolutely think that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Sorry.   There are some functions it does that are governmental. We're trying to get to the dividing line.   And Justice Alito said, if it's commercial, it should not be subject to any exemption. If it's governmental, are you agreeing that it does receive immunity? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Only if the TVA shows that it clearly meets one of the Burr prongs. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So let's assume it does, where to build a dam.   Is that governmental enough for you? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I don't know under those circumstances, but I will point the Court to an example that the Court has actually considered, and this is a pre-Burr case.   It's Tennessee Electric Power Company versus TVA, and 306 U.S. 118.   And in that case, the challenged conduct was the TVA.   Somebody sought a -- a private power company sought an injunction against the TVA so that it could not produce or sell power at all. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, it seems to me that that's really a close question, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I -- I -- I think that under those cases, because the Court in that case -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Let's assume we -- on common ground.   There are some functions that are governmental.   You're unwilling to specify which at the moment. But do you -- do you agree that there are some functions that may be governmental? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " There are some functions that may be governmental and Burr accounts for -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So that's fine. The question before us is what to do about the middle stuff, or are you saying this is just commercial? And if you're saying it's just commercial, explain the Chief Justice's description of why it might not be just commercial, and how do we draw that line? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " It's not whether something is commercial or not commercial.   I think the commercial activity certainly imply more -- less immunity -- or apply less immunity.   But there's got to be some sort of deference that Congress has -- what Congress has done, and that Congress has completely stripped this entity of the immunity under this Court's law. This Court has said that these waivers are broad, that they must be liberally construed, that any exceptions must be narrowly construed. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " You said -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, we've held -- we've held that the immunity has not been completely stripped, right? We've recognized that there are circumstances under which the TVA, as well as these other entities that are carved out of the FTCA, nonetheless have immunity. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, absolutely, that there are circumstances.   But, here, in this case, we don't believe, one, that that implicates the kind of immunities under Burr that this Court talked about. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, maybe we need some examples of ones you think are covered.   I mean, one of the things the TVA does is regulate flood control in the area. So, at a particular moment, it has a choice whether to let more water through, which may damage lower downstream farms, or keep more water back, which might damage upstream farms. Now, if you're downstream and you're injured, can you bring a negligence action against the TVA for that decision, and show -- for example, show they -- they did the calculations wrong because of pure negligence? Can you bring that action against the FT -- against the TVA? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I think so.   I think that under that action you can, because, one, you're not talking about the -- there's no statutory scheme issue. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So flood control is something that you can sue the TVA on? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " There are certain circumstances where, absolutely, I think so. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, what are -- give me an example of something you can't sue them on. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I think that if I'm a private landowner and I've got land on the -- right on the banks of the Tennessee River, and the TVA wants to exercise some of the power that Congress has given it in being able to use eminent domain, take land to put up power lines, then I can't turn around and sue the TVA and say no, you can't do that. That is one of those things where, no, Congress has -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but you can't sue -- you can't sue somebody with eminent domain power anytime.   I mean, if they're giving you -- if you -- if they have eminent domain power, they're paying you for it, so you can't sue them to -- to stop it. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Or a -- or, I guess, a -- a negligence action saying no, you should have put the -- the lines -- you're going to take my land, you should have taken my neighbor's land and put the lines that way.   I don't know that that is something that the statutory scheme here necessarily contemplates. But I do think that Congress -- and if you look at the legislative history, Congress -- Congress absolutely contemplated tort liability with -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Part of the problem is figuring out what Burr means, to my problem at least.   And you said there's a big difference between Burr and the discretionary-function exception. How would you articulate that big difference? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " We think that Burr accounts for much more.   The discretionary-function exception only looks at the conduct at issue, the executive conduct at issue.   Burr accounts for the other branch of government, Congress, that it has created an entity. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Well, that doesn't tell me what the exception means, though.   That just describes the situation. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " So the exceptions would be an inconsistency with the statutory scheme, some -- some lawsuit that is just not contemplated by the text.   It's not allowed. And, here, we don't have that.   There's no argument or even assertion that the court -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What about -- what about the second -- I'm sorry to interrupt, the second prong, though, grave interference? How do you think about that? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I think that there -- normal tort liability in this case does not implicate the type of governmental conduct that Burr's second prong is written to protect. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And are you -- just so I understand your argument here, are you asking us to simply hold that the right test is Burr, instead of discretionary function, and then to remand for application of Burr in the first instance by the court of appeals? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " At -- at a minimum.   I think at a maximum -- that we can live with that -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What's the maximum? Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " The maximum is that we can look at this as a 12(b)(1) dismissal, we can take the facts as stated in the complaint, in the affidavit, as true, and say no, this is just not the type of conduct that is inconsistent with the constitutional scheme, because that's really the only element that is at issue here. There was no findings of fact on the grave interference test.   The court -- lower courts didn't consider it.   There's -- there was no showing under Burr. The whole issue here is the TVA is trying to couch the constitutional scheme in a separation of powers in that this court would be violating separation of powers if it were to exercise jurisdiction and even hear the case. That's the only issue.   But this Court has never looked at separation of powers that way.   It -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I think people are actually a little bit more interested in the second prong of -- of Burr, which is the interference with government operations.   So, if you were to answer Justice Kavanaugh's question and say this is not the conduct that should be immune from suit because, how would you finish the sentence in thinking about the second prong of Burr? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Because there's no grave interference.   The TVA can raise rates on me, a citizen who lives 30 minutes away from where this happened.   I -- it can raise rates on me as one of the 10 million households that it has -- it serves power to. It can buy insurance.   It's self-funded.   It's not like other branches of -- departments of the government that need congressional appropriations. And, three, this is not the kind of conduct -- liability here for raising a downed power line is not the kind of conduct that is going to affect the TVA's ability to go out tomorrow and the next day and every day after that and continue to produce power.   It is not the kind of conduct.   These facts will not gravely interfere with the TVA's functions. If there are no further questions, I'd like to -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I will go back for a second because I think that we have a statute, TVA exempt from the Federal Tort Claims Act.   I thought the government is agreeing with you. Burr does apply.   But Burr sometimes says that we have the equivalent of a Federal Tort Claims Act.   Sometimes.   Okay? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " At least.   And you agree with that? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   So let's go back and see if you have anything else to say. Suppose we wrote this in the opinion. Yes, when the TVA is performing a governmental function, the FTCA does apply, i.e., the discretionary exemption part.   But when it is not and acting just like a private business person, it doesn't. Does that satisfy you? And then we leave it to the lower courts to decide which is which.   Okay? Suppose we did that.   Would that satisfy you?

Breyer", "text": " No, they don't disagree that Burr applies.   I think -- I think I'm right about that.   They don't disagree that there is an exemption from the FTCA. So the problem I guess for me is not who's right or wrong, but what are the words that we use to describe when Burr applies and when it doesn't? And that's where I need some help.   I may have not analyzed the case yet correctly, but, if I have, then I need to know the answer to that question. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " I don't think there is a line for these entities between commercial and governmental.   One is immune; one is not.   I think the question is that all of its functions, whatever power it has, whatever it does, each and all of those things may come under Burr.   You may have -- the discretionary-function test under the FTCA and Burr may reach the same conclusion, but they're different.   And it's governmental functions here.   It may be perfectly amenable to suit and not implicate the constitutional, statutory scheme, and there will be no grave interference in its ability to do the work the next day, even its governmental functions.   And it also applies for its commercial functions. So making that line, I don't know is -- meets Burr.   And that one doesn't apply and one does.   I think it all can apply, and you can have results, what the TVA forces here, and you can have results where nothing happens at all.   And it's sueable just like a private entity who might put up a dam. But, if there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Ms. Adams. "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court recognized in Burr that a sue-and-be-sued clause need not be read to waive immunity for absolutely everything that the agency could be sued for.   It described categories of claims that might not be allowed, notwithstanding a purportedly broad waiver of immunity. Discretionary-function immunity, which is grounded in constitutional separation of powers principles and preexisted the enactment of the Federal Tort Claims Act, is precisely the type of immunity that Congress had in mind when that -- and it would have expected to survive.

You'll have to explain to me why raising a power line is a government function. Every -- and I understand there are some private contractors who actually own and operate and sell fuel from dams.   If a power line goes down, they have to raise it.   Any commercial enterprise that creates a danger has to fix it.   That's what businesses do, whether it's the government running the business or not. What is a governmental discretionary policy having to do with creating a danger in the operation of its business, meaning the power line is down, no one's going to say the government is authorized to be negligent in fixing it and harming people? You want to take it to the broader discretion of do I have one or two men, do I give this type of warning or that kind of warning.   But why does that take it out of a commercial choice?

I think, at the time that the FTCA was enacted, the TVA and legislators were concerned on the heels of the Depression about subjecting residents of the Tennessee Valley to those types of claims when they had already been interacting with the TVA for about a decade and had come to have certain rights. But discretionary-function, the ability to sue TVA for its exercise of discretion in tort claims, was not one such right.   TVA had been asserting discretionary-function immunity in the courts even before the FTCA was enacted, and it had been winning. And so, at the time TVA was excluded, you know, the legislative history of the FTCA shows that it was Congress's understanding that even if it didn't enact a statutory exception, that courts would have come to the same place by judicial construction, and there's nothing to indicate that the TVA was uniquely outside of Congress's expectation that this common law discretionary-function immunity would continue to apply.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So you're saying lowest cost feasible means, to the extent you can deprive individuals harmed by their activities, purely commercial activities, that that counts in trying to keep the costs low? "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " I mean, I think that's an argument.   We haven't really rolled out that argument, but it is an argument that's in the statute.   And -- and, again, I would just -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I'm not sure you haven't rolled it out.   The idea that -- that someone who's harmed, who would otherwise get a recovery from a private entity, but because of the immunity doesn't, I thought that was the basic idea.   It interferes with the governmental function to make them pay tort damages. "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " Well, yeah, perhaps that's right.   Maybe that's just an additional way of saying that it's inconsistent with the statutory scheme to -- to have TVA paying out damages claims and having the -- the -- the court second-guess the discretionary decisions that TVA is making. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But the -- you're trying to fold the discretionary-function exception into the second part of Burr. But is it really the case -- I guess one response would be is it really the case that you need this broad discretionary-function exception in all these kinds of hypothetical cases that have been raised in order to avoid a grave interference for the governmental function, which seems like a high bar set forth in Burr? "}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " Yes.   I mean, we -- again, we think that whether to recognize a discretionary-function exception is like what you're applying -- and Burr is not like a codified statute.   It's describing general categories of claims that may be excluded from a sue-and-be-sued clause even though Congress has said the agency could be sued. And -- and this is a category of claims that we think, anything involving the exercise of discretion, if you permitted suits allowing that, that it would interfere with the agency's function. So I think that's what we're asking for here, is for the Court to say that, under Burr, TVA gets discretionary-function immunity. And then, in any individual case, you could apply the discretionary-function test to see if the facts of the case meet that well-established immunity. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Just on the facts of this case, why would allowing a negligence suit to proceed interfere with important government functions?

"}, {"speaker": "Ann O'Connell Adams", "text": " It's -- on the facts of this case, you know, the Petitioners say, well, TVA could continue operating the next day, even if they're required to pay out damages to this particular plaintiff.   But Burr is not set up to be a case-by-case test. It's looking for categories of cases that should be excluded, just like paying out damages to one individual person whose crops were destroyed by water that was let out of the reservoir wouldn't be a big deal, but, as a category of cases, those would interfere with the government's functions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Ms. Adams. Mr. Rouse, you have four minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " The FTCA and discretionary function analysis just don't apply to Tennessee Valley Authority.   Congress hasn't given the Tennessee Valley Authority that immunity.   It's just said the Tennessee Valley Authority may be sued, period. And so, if the TVA's going to get any immunity at all, it's going to have to meet this Court's test.   It's going to have to clearly show one of the three things that this Court has said is required. It hasn't done that.   It didn't do it below and it's not doing it now. It's instead just trying to smuggle in the discretionary analysis under Burr's constitutional scheme language.   It's trying to say, no, it would violate separation of powers. But that's not violation of separation of powers.   Not here.   Nothing here would prevent the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally-assigned functions or would be the Judiciary's impermissible trespass upon the Executive or an undertaking -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What about the other sentence in Prosser: \"For example, activities of police or firefighters, though tortious, are usually considered governmental, in the sense that they involve the kind of power expected of government, even if its exercise in the specific case is wrongful, the city is immune as to such activities for this reason.\" So Prosser seems to distinguish between what's commercial and what's basically governmental. Now they're legislating in Congress against that background.   The words are rather unclear.   Why don't we assume it picks up that background, which is where Justice Alito started? "}, {"speaker": "Franklin Taylor Rouse", "text": " That -- there is certainly a distinction between governmental work, deciding where to put a dam up, and running new power lines across a line, lifting one up out of the water.   There is certainly a distinction in that. Burr accounts for them.   Burr accounts for the policy decisions, whether commercial, governmental, or not, it just accounts for the policy decisions that those can be immune, that those should be immune, that it is necessary in some circumstances to give immunity for policy decisions that -- that contemplate social, economic, or political decisions. That all exists under Burr.   But commercial conduct here that is not grounded in any of those things is not protected.   It has not been protected by Congress.   And the Court shouldn't do it again here. If there are no further questions, thank you for your time. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
