[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-1191, Loretta Lynch, Attorney General, v. Morales-Santana. Mr. Kneedler. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States Constitution does not confer U.S. citizenship on anyone born outside the United States.   Rather, pursuant to its plenary authority under Article I of the Constitution, it is for Congress to determine which categories of such persons should be granted U.S. citizenship by statute. In doing so, Congress has always required that the persons involved have a demonstrated and sufficient connection to the United States, either in themselves or through their parents, to warrant the conferral of citizenship, because citizenship carries with it attendant duties and rights on the part of the individual, and important duties of protection and obligation on the part of the United States government. This case concerns the framework under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as originally enacted for granting citizenship to persons outside the United States as of the date of their birth. Other provisions deal with the granting of citizenship later in life.   Those were open to Respondent or his father in this case, but were not taken advantage of. In particular, this case concerns the granting of citizenship to children born out of wedlock abroad, a situation in which this Court's -- this Court's cases made clear that mothers and fathers are not typically similarly situated with respect to their legal status concerning the child at the moment of birth. The general rules for citizenship at birth are set out in 8 U.S.C. 1401.   And I'm referring to the Act as originally enacted; it was revised in 1986.   If both parents were U.S. citizens, then a child born outside the United States would be a citizen of the United States as long as one of the parents had resided in the United States for any period of time.   Congress did not deem that to be a sufficient connection to the United States, given that both parents are citizens. On the other hand, if one parent was a U.S. citizen and one parent was an alien, Congress had a markedly different approach.   The U.S.-citizen parent had to -- had to have resided in the United States for ten years, five of which were after reaching the age of 14.   Congress evidently determined that because such a child would have competing claims of allegiance, that a greater residency was -- was required for the parent to establish the connection to the United States. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Is that an argument we heard much about in the Flores-Villar case? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " It was -- it was made at the oral argument in -- in Flores-Villar, and -- but we think it's also evident from the face of the statute. As this Court said in Nguyen with respect to another argument that the -- that the Court addressed there, it's important for the Court itself to look at the -- at the structure, text, and operation of the statute to see that the -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I thought, in Villar, the -- the government spent most of its argument talking about the differential treatment primarily on the grounds of statelessness. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And -- and here your argument is -- the thrust of your argument is -- is somewhat a different need to ensure sufficient ties. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " What -- we're making both arguments.   And -- and we did -- we did argue in Flores-Villar that there should be a connection to the United States and that the statutory framework is set up that way. It's true that our emphasis was on statelessness, but we are now arguing -- and, again, we think it's -- it's entirely evident from the face of the statute -- that what -- what these provisions are after is connection to the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Why aren't men and women who are parents similarly situated with respect to their affiliation, their attachment to U.S. values? I mean, there's no reason to think a man is less -- has less of a sense of U.S. belonging than a woman? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Right.   And we're -- and we're making no such argument.   The -- the point is that where you have -- where you have -- at the -- at the moment of birth, the mother, as -- as this Court recognized in the -- in the Nguyen case and has recognized in cases like Lehr v. Robertson in the domestic context, the mother is the only legally recognized parent. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " There are many cases, especially generations back when this law was on the books, where the mother -- the birth certificate came sometime after the child was born, and both the father's name and the mother's name might be on it. So it is -- it is not -- the moment of birth doesn't necessarily tell you who is the mother if she -- if there is no birth certificate, and then the child, when they get the birth certificate, both names are on it. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " But I -- I think this Court's decision in Nguyen and the -- and the State statutes that we identify in a footnote in our brief are premised on -- on the proposition that the identity of the mother and her relationship to the child will be known by virtue of the birth alone, or at least will be known in the overwhelming majority of cases. In that situation there is only one parent. There is not a competing claim of citizenship to -- a competing claim of allegiance to another country through another parent. On the other hand, when the father legitimates, at that point you have two parents, and it -- in the situation where they are of different nationalities, then you are put in the situation where there are competing claims -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But why do we look, Mr. Kneedler, to the moment of birth? Why shouldn't we look to the moment when citizenship is sought? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Because this -- this statutory provision specifically deals with citizenship at birth, and the -- the statute that that's its caption, of 1409(a), with respect to the situation where the father legitimates, says the child shall be a citizen as of birth, and it's important to understand exactly what is operating here. At -- at the moment of birth, again, the child only has one -- one parent.   When the father legitimates, what Congress has done generously, one could say, but at least sensibly, is to say we will treat the couple as if they were married at the moment of birth.   They are giving retroactive application to the legitimation so that the -- so that the children -- the child is treated as the child of married parents at that point. If the -- if the legitimating father is a U.S. citizen, in that situation you would have two U.S.-citizen parents, and the very generous rule for U.S.-citizen parents would apply in that -- in that situation. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But Nguyen -- Nguyen was more a matter of -- of proof, whereas this case, as Justice Ginsburg indicates, is a question of which -- does the child have sufficient ties to the country. It's quite a different -- quite a different proposition that the two address, it seems to me. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Two -- two things about that. This Court's decision in Nguyen had two -- had identified two separate interests.   One was the proof of paternity, and -- but the other was recognizing the connection to the United States. The connection to the United States in a situation like this has two steps: What is the relationship of the child to the parent? And Nguyen was concerned about establishing that relationship, that in -- in some formal sense and also underlying it, a real sense of establishing that relationship. This case deals with the relationship of the parent to the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The problem is with the exception that's been created for unwed-citizen mothers, the first prong, the interest of the connection to the United States doesn't exist, because the statute doesn't require any connection to the United States except U.S. citizenship.   She could have been born, lived here a day, and moved somewhere else, and she would automatically confer. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " No, not under the 1952 Act. Under the -- that was true under the 1940 Act.   Under the 1952 Act, it's continuous presence for one year, but Congress deemed that to be basically somewhere in between the two U.S.-citizen parents situation in which any period of residency was okay and the mixed -- the mixed nationality situation where Congress said it had to be ten and five.   Congress chose a -- a period somewhere in between. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So why should it be different for an unwed father who has legitimized the child? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Because in that situation there are two parents.   The argument is not that the father's ties are less.   It's that there are competing ties, and Congress wanted to make sure that the -- that the strength of the U.S. citizen's ties were sufficient that they would outweigh or at least counteract where Congress could be sufficiently confident of the tie to the United States to grant citizenship in that -- in that situation.   And again -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why couldn't that have been done, Mr. Kneedler? Why couldn't these objectives have been served through entirely gender neutral language? For example, I know that there was a proposal that the Secretary of State made earlier than this statute was passed in the 1930s, which talked just about legal parents, which didn't refer to mothers and fathers at all. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Right.   Several things about that.   I don't think there is a claim in this case that Respondent would benefit from reading the statute in that manner, because I -- I don't think there's any question that he had citizenship and a legal parent when he was born. But beyond -- beyond that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That would get rid of the gender inequality that is at the heart of his complaint. Whether or not he in the end benefits from it, the question here is whether the statute makes -- constitutes a violation of equal protection. One question we ask when we think about a question like that is, could Congress have written the statute? Could Congress have served its objectives in an entirely gender neutral way? And it seems as though here we have the -- the Secretary of State presented a statute to Congress that actually did that. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Yes.   But it -- but as was pointed out at the time, as we point out in our brief, while that statute on its face looked gender neutral, in fact, it would have operated in exactly the same way as the statute that Congress enacted operated, because -- and no one has really taken serious issue with the proposition we have in our brief that at the moment of birth, it was the overwhelming rule that the mother was the only legally recognized parent. So in that -- this -- it would have operated in essentially the same way. And let me -- let me come at this in a slightly different direction.   If, when you have one parent, the -- the mother in -- in this case, she gets to make all of the pertinent decisions about the child. Where they will live, where they will be domiciled, situations like that. When a father legitimates, he does not -- he does not then acquire the right to make -- the sole right to make all the decisions for the child.   There are then two parents.   He gets to -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " There's a lot of complicated things, but the question I think is, think of the child.   The child is born out of wedlock.   Now, if his mother was an American, he becomes an American if she's lived here for one year.   If it's his father who's an American, she becomes an American only if he's lived here for like eight years or ten years.   Now, that's the difference, and why does that make a difference? What justifies the gender discrimination? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " But that's the same rule that applies if the parents are married, which is -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Two -- two wrongs don't make a right. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, but -- I don't think it -- no one is challenging -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Perhaps.   Yeah, yeah, I accept that no one is challenging, but I'm not asking that question. I'm asking the question of what it is -- I would repeat the question, which you heard, which I think is the equal protection question at the heart of the case. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And the answer that you give in your brief was some endlessly -- I mean, it was very well-written and brilliant -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- and -- and -- but it went into this thing about statelessness persons, and -- and then we have, like, 17 briefs that say, no, no, that wasn't what the situation was with statelessness persons.   And so I guess the question would be there: Was it enough of a statelessness person justification to warrant this gender discrimination? There is no point in you repeating that.   I think I've taken in that argument.   I'll have to make up my mind about it. Is there anything else? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, the -- the first argument we're making, again, is -- is the point of connection to the United States, and that's where the married couple comes in.   Because no one is challenging the proposition that Congress can impose a residency requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Wrong -- wrong residency requirement.   I did have Justice Kagan's question in mind when they read it. Why don't they ask the child if it would like, when it reaches the age of 21, to be connected to the United States and see if the child votes in American elections and lives there a while? Why are they so worried about the child's parents? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I mean, in any case, you don't have to answer that. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " No, no.   The Act provides for the acquisition of citizenship at a date after birth, and then -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Lived here for 14 years and so forth.   All kinds of stuff.   But -- "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I don't want to argue with you on this point.   I want to know if I've got the reason for saying the mother, if she's the U.S. citizen and he is born out of wedlock, he only lived here for a year, but the father has to live here for, like, ten years or eight years or something like that, the real justification for that you've been able to find and the only one you've been able to find has to do with this thing about statelessness? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " No.   We have two -- we have two reasons.   The first one is the connection to the United States, which is evident on the face of -- of the statute.   When the father legitimates, what -- what the statute does is treat the couple as if they were married.   In fact, in this case, the child was legitimated by marriage, and what the statute basically did was make the marriage retroactive to the date of birth. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm going to make an example where they never married. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " They -- they like living together without being married.   Now what's the justification? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, under the 1986 amendments, it's -- it is easier for the father to acknowledge the child.   But in that situation, again, there are two -- there are two parents.   And in that situation, the father does not get to make unilateral decisions about the child.   He gets to be a parent too. He doesn't get to be the only parent the way the mother is the only parent before legitimation. And this is true in Lehr v. Robertson and -- and the cases this Court has had in -- in the domestic context. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Kneedler, you're -- you are giving a sophisticated rationale, but we're talking about legislation from 1940 and 1952. At that time, the statute books were just shot through with distinctions between children born out of wedlock and affiliation with the mother and the father.   So this was a piece with all that legislation. And it wasn't until when Ms. Trimble again scored a typical.   And the Illinois Probate Code said a child born out of wedlock can inherent to an intestate succession from the mother only, not the father.   The laws just put mothers and children not born of the marriage together and separated fathers from their children. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And nobody thought until the 1970s that that was a violation of equal protection. But in a whole series of cases in the '70s, the Court recognized that, indeed, there was a violation of equal protection. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, insofar as -- I mean, there are two equal protection arguments that have been made in cases like that.   One of them has to do with equal protection on the basis of illegitimacy.   That -- that claim is not raised here with good reason, because the -- because Respondent, as -- as an alien outside the United -- person outside the United States and an alien by statute, did not have constitutional rights.   So it's the -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " My point was that the laws that existed put mothers and children born out of wedlock together and separated fathers from their children -- "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- out of what the reality of their life was. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " And in this Court's decision in Fiallo in the immigration context, that was exactly the situation, and the Court rejected equal protection claims based both on -- on sex discrimination and on illegitimacy. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " That was not a claim of citizenship. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " It wasn't, but we -- but we think -- we think, if anything, it follows Ofar Sharar, because citizenship is -- is entering into the citizenry or the membership of our society on a permanent basis with rights to come and go with all the rights and obligations. But I -- but I also wanted to address your -- your question with respect to the domestic context.   This Court's decision in Lehr v. Robertson sustained a situation where you -- where a child was going to be put up for adoption.   The mother would ordinarily have the sole right to decide that, but the situation was, what -- what about the father? Well, the father had to take some affirmative steps to put himself in a position where he could have a role, essentially a veto power over -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And the father did -- this father -- didn't the couple marry? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Yes, they did.   But, again, at that point, he is -- he is not similarly situated to the mother, either at the time of birth or at the time he legitimates. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you this question: If the Court thinks that this statute violates the Equal Protection Clause, does it necessarily follow that the Petitioner is entitled to the relief that was awarded to him by the Second Circuit; in other words, the granting of citizenship?

We -- we had a similar issue a few terms ago in the Flores-Villar case, but that was a criminal -- there, what was at issue was a criminal conviction. Here, criminal convictions are not at issue.   The criminal convictions had nothing to do with alienage; is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " The underlying criminal convictions. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Right, right.   No.   They -- they were -- they were regular state law convictions.

If we level down, then -- then it's harder for both? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " We -- we think that -- we think the Court clearly should not apply to the U.S.-citizen fathers the one-year limitation.   The general rule -- 1409(c) is an exception to a general rule that governs -- governs the vast majority -- or the three categories of cases: married fathers, married mothers, and unmarried fathers.   There is no reason to think that Congress would have wanted unmarried fathers to have a more -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, are -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " One I could think of -- one I could think of, possibly, but I'd like your opinion about it: How many, do you think, unmarried fathers there were in 1952 who couldn't qualify under the long period of time -- eight years, you know -- and that's not so hard to do, if you're in the Army, because all your active duty counts.   But they would have qualified under the one year.   Now, I use the numbers in your brief, which were brilliant of you to try to find.   I don't know how you found those. But I -- I -- that 4,000 number kept coming back.   I thought maybe there were a couple of thousand a year.   But do we know that there are more than a couple of thousand a year? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " You know, I thought -- I thought you said there were untold numbers. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, and there were the untold numbers, but that's -- that's true, they're untold numbers, and then that's not told.   I'm trying to find the -- (Laughter.)

Kneedler", "text": " It's -- it's -- it's very hard -- it's very hard to estimate.   But -- but this Court's decision in -- in Nguyen identified the number of -- of people who travel abroad, and the numbers are a little bit higher even now. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, let's go back to '52. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " It was like 70 million that take trips abroad. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Let's go back to '52, and the couple is unmarried and it's a father who, in fact, would qualify if he only had to live here for a year, but he wouldn't qualify if he had to live here for eight years before the baby's born.   Never marries the baby -- never marries the mother.   Okay. So I'm thinking, who could those people have been? They would have been -- they would have been people maybe working for American businesses or something, and there weren't that many at that time.   So I -- I used your 4,000.

And of those, I think around 3,000 are under 1409(c), which means that those are the ones granted to U.S.-citizen mothers abroad. That doesn't -- the number of fathers who might benefit could be far larger than -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Could I -- I'm sorry.   Were you finished? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Could I -- I mean, we generally have a rule that when we find an equal protection violation, we level up rather than level down.   That's been the Court's consistent practice. Wouldn't you agree? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " That's been its practice, yes.   But that -- that -- the Court has made clear that that is not constitutionally compelled.   And there -- there are compelling reasons here not to do that. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I find one compelling reason to do it -- and I just thought I'd offer this up to you and see what you have to say -- is that in this case, unlike in some cases, there really isn't a choice between leveling up and leveling down in one sense, because if you level down, this party gets no relief. In other words, you say, well, you level -- you just apply it prospectively.   But then this party gets absolutely no relief.   And so isn't that a problem? Isn't it the kind of the same problem as Justice Harlan recognized in -- in Welsh when he was dealing with a criminal matter? He said, you know, you can't level down because you can't give everybody the exact same benefit. So how do we deal with that? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, several things. In this context in particular, there are serious questions about whether the Court can, but, at the very least, substantial reasons why the Court should not grant citizenship to someone -- effectively grant citizenship to someone to whom Congress itself has not granted it.

The unwed father is equal to the unwed mother.   The married mother, equal to the married father.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S.

Not a situation where we say, uh, there is an equal protection violation, and if we extend the benefit to everybody, we can take care of that equal protection violation, we can remedy the problem.   But if we do not, if we try to level down, the effect of that is that the -- the party before us who has proved an equal protection violation gets absolutely no relief at all. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " I -- I would like to answer that quickly and then reserve the balance of my time of -- of -- for rebuttal. I think it's also relevant, in taking into account the remedy, that this is not Respondent's own constitutional right.   It's a third-party claim. There's no automatic right to raise the rights of third parties; in this case, the father.   So I think that would properly be taken into account in deciding whether a remedy at all is feasible and what it would be. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Broome. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen A. Broome", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's father was a citizen of the United States.   Holding other things constant, had he been the mother instead of the father, there would be no question that he transmitted citizenship to Respondent under Section 1409. But the statute bars him from doing so on the same terms of the mother is not based on any innate or biological difference between men and women or mothers and fathers, nor does it ensure an interest in reducing statelessness, or -- nor does it serve an interest in reducing statelessness or ensuring that -- that citizenship by descent pass only to those children who are likely to learn American values.   Both of the government's justifications for the gender differential at here therefore fail. I would like to begin by addressing the standard of review.   There is no dispute here that Respondent has third-party standing to assert the equal protection claim of his father.   That claim plainly is subject to intermediate scrutiny. In Fiallo v. Bell, this Court applied rational basis review to the claims of aliens who were seeking Visas based on their relationship to a U.S.-citizen relative.   It is true, as the government points out, that the Fiallo plaintiffs included a U.S.-citizen father, but the Court in Fiallo disagreed that -- with -- with the dissenting justices and with the plaintiffs that his equal protection rights were at stake.   And there was never any question that the aliens in that case were not U.S. citizens.

You put the one year on both and then you have, when the parents are married, it's the ten years, and when it's the -- they're not married, it's the one year, and that really doesn't make much sense.   But the -- the -- so I'm -- I'm -- hope you'll get to that. And in the course of that, I read an amicus brief that bothered me a lot, and it said, actually, the one-year requirement is tougher.

Whether or not -- if -- if the -- in order to decide whether the court should address the constitutional issue, the court first asked whether Respondent's father would have satisfied the one continuous year rule. So we went to the Western District of New York, and we were not -- the government ultimately stipulated that, yes, because we have evidence of Respondent's father being in the United States, or in this case an outlying possession, from his birth in 1900 until the date of his departure for the Dominican Republic in 1919, we will -- we will presume that there was at least some period in there where he was in the United States for one continuous year.   And I think that that presumption would apply in most cases.   It certainly was applied in this case that we would not have to come forward and show proof on -- that he was in the United States on every single day.

The remedy imposed by the Court of Appeals is to -- as 1401(a)(7), which the -- the physical-presence requirement, the ten- and five-year physical-presence requirement, the Court of Appeals -- that -- that applies through 1409(a)   1409(a) is the provision that applies to fathers. So the -- the remedy would be to apply the one-continuous-year rule in 1401(a)(7) -- and I grant you this is complicated -- 1401(a)(7) as it -- as it applies through 1409(a)   And that would put mothers and fathers on equal footing with respect to the physical-presence requirements.   And then the legitimation requirement still applies to fathers. But if I could address the -- the government's U.S.-connection interest in my time remaining. The statute here absolutely bars a U.S.-citizen father under the age of 19 from transmitting citizenship to his foreign-born child, even if the father spent his entire life in the United States up until the day the child is born, and even if the father legitimates the child and seeks to raise the child in the United States. By contrast, the statute automatically confers citizenship on a child whose U.S.-citizen mother spent only a year of her life at any point in her time -- any point in her life, even during infancy, and even if the -- even if the mother marries the alien father, and then -- and then the child is raised by the mother and the alien father. It is impossible to view a statute that permits these results as related to a U.S.-connection interest.   And I would submit, Your Honor, that the statelessness interest does not justify the discrimination either. There is no dispute here that the statute creates a risk of statelessness for children born abroad to unmarried United States-citizen fathers who legitimate their children but who cannot satisfy the ten -- ten- and five-year physical-presence requirement. And the statute -- the -- the statute confers citizenship on a child born abroad to an unmarried United States-citizen mother, even if that child faces -- even if her child faces no risk of statelessness at all because she is born -- the child is born in a country that assigns citizenship by virtue of being born there. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, we aren't leaving children uncovered whose mothers have not had a continuous one-year residency in the United States, even though that mother may be an American citizen. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen A. Broome", "text": " That's -- that's right.   My point is that her child may have no risk -- face no risk -- risk of statelessness at all, and -- and yet, the statute still confers citizenship -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I just said they do. Because the mother can only pass on citizenship if she's been in the United States continuously for one year prior to the birth of the child, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen A. Broome", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what happens to a citizen mother who can't meet that one-year requirement? What happens to her child? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen A. Broome", "text": " That -- that child could be stateless.   That child is not -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So there is a risk of statelessness no matter what? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen A. Broome", "text": " There is a risk of statelessness, but that risk of statelessness is created by these physical-presence requirements that Congress chose to impose, whether it's the mother or the father. The risk is greater with respect to the fathers.   It is lesser with respect to the mothers.   But it is these physical-presence requirements that create the risk of statelessness, and therefore, this scheme cannot be justified as seeking to reduce a risk of statelessness. If the Court has no further questions, thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Kneedler. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, on the merits.   The provision here furnished two substantial governmental interests.   At the time the child is born, and there is only the mother that as a recognized parent, it is uncertain whether the child will ever be legitimated. Congress has a substantial interest in conferring citizenship on that child at birth if it concludes that there is a sufficient connection to the United States. Congress also has a substantial interest in not divesting that child of citizenship if the child is later legitimated by an alien father.   So there are two substantial interests that are furthered, and it is precisely tailored to take care of those two interests. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But if you're concerned about the stateless children in the world, then -- if -- if you have a problem with the father who can't transmit his citizenship in a country where women citizenship goes by who is the father.

Kneedler", "text": " Well, it -- it -- if the -- if the father later legitimates, he's put in the same position as if the -- if they were married at the time the child was born.   And we know from 1401 that that -- that that is a -- that that is a -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But today there are -- today there are lots of fathers who do look after their children.   I don't say they do it perfectly, but they try. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " No, but all -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now, suppose just the words you said, take the same words, just put in \"father\" instead of \"mother,\" and today why is it any different? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, it -- it isn't different.   I -- I just want to repeat again.   When the father legitimates, there are two parents.   In Lehr v. Robertson -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm not talking about legitimacy.   I'm talking about the ones -- a surprising number of people, unfortunately, never get married.   And a lot of them do live abroad, and they do have children. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, certainly -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So that's one focus.   And certainly your words applied where it is the mother. And all my question is, couldn't you take those same words and apply it where it is the father? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " No.   I -- I think it's a critical importance in citizenship laws to have a legal occurrence in order to pass citizenship, and that's legitimation.   Your suggestion that you could -- that the father could pass on citizenship without even legitimation, which this Court basically sustained on the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Doesn't (c) say that? Doesn't (c) say that? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Yes.   But -- but this is a question of remedy.   And -- and to -- to -- but -- and also Lehr v. Robertson, if the father filed -- filed a notice and -- or filed a document and got notice of the proceeding, he didn't get the veto power that the mother had before legitimation.   He just got to be a parent too.   And that's exactly what happens here when the father legitimates.   He's not put in the same position as the mother because of two parents; it's a two-parent family. With respect to remedy, let me point out at page 38 of our brief where the statelessness is addressed.   It's clear the interests that I identify, that Congress wanted to ensure that the child would have citizenship at birth and not be divested. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
