[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument next in Case 19-351, the Federal Republic of Germany versus Philipp. Mr. Freiman. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the expropriation exception in 1976, Communist states had been engaging in widespread expropriation of property from American nationals and denying that the international law of takings required them to pay compensation. Congress enacted a series of targeted measures, including the expropriation exception, to counter these states' rejections of the law of takings.   The exception lets U.S. courts hear claims against foreign sovereigns when \"rights in property taken in violation of international law\" are at issue. That language invoked the established international law doctrine known as the law of takings.   As the Restatement and other sources show, the doctrine addresses only nations' takings of foreigners' property.   And by referring to it, Congress incorporated its limits into the expropriation exception. The plaintiffs ignore this context, trying to turn this modest exception into a novel tool for suing foreign sovereigns for human rights and law of war violations occurring in their own countries.   That reading should be rejected for three reasons. First, it ignores the established meaning of the exception's words when enacted in 1976. Second, it creates a jurisdictional mismatch with the exception's text.   The exception focuses on rights in property, giving jurisdiction over property claims.   It would be bizarre for courts to decide if a state has violated human rights law by murdering its own nationals just as a jurisdictional hook to hear a property claim. Finally, every applicable canon points away from a reading that would depart sharply from the restrictive theory, put the U.S. deeply in breach of the international law of state immunity, blur the jurisdictional lines over foreign sovereigns, where clarity is needed most, cause friction in foreign relations, and risk reciprocal treatment against the U.S. Congress can take these risks if it wants to, but it hasn't yet. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, just to make sure, your position is because this suit involves property rights, it should not be regarded as a qualification of the international -- of international law or a case in which genocide is a pertinent issue in deciding the question of jurisdiction? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " That's right, Your Honor.   We believe that (a)(3) explicitly is invoking and referring to the international law of takings, that the legislators would have known in 1976 when enacting the statute against that backdrop. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, why then do you -- why do you think that expropriation of property can't be part of a campaign of genocide? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " Well, property can be expropriated in a number of contexts, but the gravamen of (a)(3) is the taking of property, and the law that it's referring to is the international law of taking. I think a genocidal taking, as Your Honor puts it, is unquestionably an act of genocide if it inflicts conditions of life calculated to physically destroy a people, but it's not a taking of property within the meaning of the expropriation exception. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I guess my question is why that is.   If it is part of a campaign of genocide, that doesn't alter the fact that it's simply taking property? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " Well, I think there's -- there's three reasons, Your Honor, in terms of the -- the evidence that Congress was intending to invoke the international law of takings in (a)(3).   The text, of course, is referring to language in international law, so the question is, what takings are wrongful under international law? And the Restatement provision operable at the time answered that question, with the section said -- say -- ask -- asking when are takings wrongful under international law. I think second is the statutory context.   You had the Sabbatino decision of this Court followed by a series of targeted responses of increasing force to foreign nations that refused to recognize the existence of the international law of takings.

Counsel, the -- I -- I understand your argument about -- with respect to taking, but can't the -- just imagine that there's a campaign, first of all, of genocide, but in conjunction with and a part of that, there's an effort to take all of the property, including jewelry, art, and even the extraction of gold teeth, for example, taking of things like spectacles.   You can go down the list of some of the awful things that were done. Can that be a part of genocide? Can that taking be a part of genocide, not separate from genocide? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " Well, Your Honor, if, in fact, a -- a country is taking property with the intent of physically destroying a people or a part of a people, it -- it's unquestionably a genocidal act. But the question, again, is what Congress intended in (a)(3).   Was it invoking any kind of -- anything that could be described as a taking, or does it have to be the gravamen of the claim? And, here, the gravamen of the claim in the example you gave would be genocide.   But Congress did not see fit to create any kind of exception for genocide claims or other international human rights or law of war claims. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " But don't you think that 1605 aids in the way that it sort of allows for a -- allows for the systematic campaigns, of course, of confiscation from -- of cultural art, doesn't that suggest that when it's aimed at a -- at a vulnerable group, that it is actionable under FSIA?

(h) clarified the commercial nexus requirement in saying that in general, an art loan from another country isn't commercial activity in the U.S., but it created a carveout for Nazi-era claims.   That carveout just left the preexisting commercial nexus definition, but it also -- (h) expressly leaves the definition of \"property taken in violation of international law\" untouched.

First of all, the entity from which the property was allegedly taken was a -- was a company, the consortium, which was itself owned by three firms underneath that which were also companies.   So this is a case of claimed takings from German national companies. But, in response to your question as to the individuals, the individuals here -- this sales transaction was finalized in the summer of 1935 according to the amended complaint, which is before the Nuremberg laws went into existence, before -- before Jewish Germans were stripped of German citizenship, so it wouldn't be relevant here. Finally, to the extent that they were stripped of -- of citizenship, the question under the international law of takings is not the citizenship but is the nationality of the individuals. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, that would get into some very difficult questions concerning the nationality of people who lived in parts of Eastern Europe that were -- that -- that had been disputed among the countries in that region for some time. But getting -- get -- getting back to the issue of timing, in the Clarification Act of 2016, Congress defined the covered period as beginning in 1933. So, in Germany, were there takings in violation of international law under your interpretation prior to 1938, in other words, cases in which the property of non-German Jews was taken by the Third Reich? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " There's nothing in the record with regard to that either way, Your Honor, but I have no doubt that that occurred. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

I think that's clear from the Clarification Act today. So why don't we follow the plain meaning of the statute, and why should we look to customary international law as opposed to simply the plain meaning of the words? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M.

And as Bostock made clear recently, when there's a difference in the meaning at the time of enactment as opposed to the present day and there's evidence of that, you do need to look to that. Here, we have a situation where the -- the House Report specifically refers to a taking in violation of international law as a term, which means that it's referring to a body of law.

And then you have, you know, \"taken in violation of international law.\" I understood you to concede the point that property can be taken in -- as -- as -- as -- as part of, as an important element of genocide, so that property can be taken in -- in violation of international law.

Freiman", "text": " I think the important thing is to read the clause as a whole, and the term here is \"taken in violation of international law,\" which, as noted, was something that had a defined meaning in the international law of takings, which is what Congress was addressing in responding to the Communist expropriations. I -- I think it's also -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I mean, I guess -- I guess, Mr. Freiman, it's clear that Congress was thinking about a certain thing primarily, which is the -- which was the expropriation context.

Freiman", "text": " I don't think so, Your Honor, because I think the question is what's the gravamen.   If there's a claim that there were conditions of life that were created that led to the potential destruction of a people, that's a claim of genocide.   That's not a claim of a taking.

You indicated that the Jewish victims of the Holocaust were stripped of their citizenship but not nationality and are, therefore, still barred by the domestic takings rule. But, if they can't access the domestic takings laws because they are no longer citizens, in -- in what respect could that -- could that rule bar them? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " Let me respond in -- in -- in three parts, Your Honor. First of all, the question of statelessness is not a question that was raised by the plaintiffs in this case in the district court, court of appeals, or here.   So this is entirely a forfeited question, one that the Court need not address, and, in fact, hasn't been developed in any way. The second -- the second -- the second point is that, just to remind you, historically here the claims are that this transaction occurred in the summer of 1935, which is -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Let -- let -- let -- let's put aside the -- the dates and the facts.

"}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " That would require this Court to go down the path of determining the international law of nationality.   I will say that there's no bad treatment exception under the international law of nationality, and if it were read -- it's not a -- the international law of takings is not a human rights principle. It's a principle of nation-to-nation rights and of the transfer of wealth. And in that sense, this would create an enormous expansion of the international law of takings if you viewed people who were stateless as being somehow immune from the ordinary rules of the international law of takings.

At page 10 of your reply brief, you say, and I'm quoting, \"It is literally possible to read the exception to mean takings that violate any principle of international law.\" And to follow up on questions asked by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, why isn't that the end of the case? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " I mean, this Court held in Samantar that the mere fact that something is literally possible does not mean it's what -- it's what the text meant.   And in Dolan, this Court has noted that reading a statute to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities is sometimes in error. In the context of the FSIA, this Court has made repeatedly clear that it's important to remember what Congress was going after.   What Congress was going after was codifying the restrictive theory and avoiding friction in international relations. To read this to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities, to -- to -- to cut this phrase apart into different pieces and say it can cover this is to create friction in international relations.   It's to risk reciprocity in the ways discussed in the previous case. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Barrett.

And Judge Katsas pointed out in his dissent from denial of rehearing en banc that in the context of the kinds of claims that the plaintiffs asserted here, that the scheme they propose oddly matches the jurisdictional equivalent of a thermonuclear weapon, determining the scope of genocide, to the merits equivalent of swatting a fly, which is looking at the underlying merits, determining whether there was a common law conversion. Would -- in the private context that -- that everybody agrees could go forward under the international law of takings if this were a suit brought by foreign nationals, would that involve the court in the same kind of quagmire that Judge Katsas is identifying here, having to determine the scope of a genocide, or does resort to the international law of takings give the court a clean way of deciding it without having to get into the human rights aspect? "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " It gives the court the clean way, Your Honor, because the court just has to decide was the claimant a national of another state, and then the basic parameters of the international law of takings, was there -- was there compensation given, was it prompt and effective?

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " A minute to wrap up, Mr. Freiman. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " Thank you. I'd like to, I guess, raise three reasons for skepticism about the broad reading of (a)(3) the plaintiffs provide, and the first two track what you heard earlier in Simon. Under plaintiffs' view of the expropriation exception, it's easier to sue a foreign sovereign than it is to sue a private defendant under the ATS because, under the ATS, Kiobel makes clear that foreign-cubed cases don't belong in U.S. courts. The second is there's no serious account of reciprocity concerns.   Those were laid out ably by counsel for Hungary.   I need not repeat them.   But they're extraordinary here when we're talking about subjecting a foreign sovereign to potential liability for the gravest human rights abuses in history. The third is clarity with regard to jurisdiction, especially for foreigners.   In Helmerich, in the context of the expropriation exception, this Court made clear that clarity is particularly important.   In our view, it's there.   It's the international law of taking. In their view, it's unbounded: any international law that anyone can think of in the human rights or law of war context. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States deplores the atrocities committed against victims of the Nazi regime and has long had a policy of encouraging Germany and other countries to provide mechanisms to afford a measure of justice. Respondents, though, have sought to sue in U.S. court, but the exception to sovereign immunity on which they rely is limited to violations of the international law of takings or expropriations, which has long prohibited only the taking of a foreign national's property if done without compensation. That interpretation is confirmed by the parallel provision of the Restatement in effect when the FSIA was enacted, and the exception's statutory history is part of Congress's response to the uncompensated expropriation of Americans' property by Cuba and others. By contrast, to read the expropriation exception as opening U.S. courts to suits based on human rights violation would constitute a major department -- departure from the FSIA's text, structure, and context, and require U.S. courts to make sensitive judgments about a foreign state's treatment of the persons within its territory.

The -- the -- it -- it -- it seems pretty clear at the time that the only -- the only international law addressing takings was the law of expropriation, which had to do with -- with whether compensation was awarded to a foreign national.

"}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, several things. It's -- it's an aspect of the rule of state responsibility to other states.   And so, when -- when the expropriating state takes the property of another state's nationals, that is offending the rights of that state, and that individual, Congress concluded, should be able to sue. But corresponding to that, this Court has often said, in Sabbatino and elsewhere, that the -- that that principle is limited to the taking of property of aliens because, as a general principle, the treatment of a country of -- of its own nationals is not a matter of international concern. So what was -- and -- and if a -- if a state -- and this was true in Communist states. This was the controversy at the time.   Many states believed that they could take their citizens' property without compensation.   And -- and the act of state doctrine in Sabbatino did not interfere with that at all. All of those cases and -- and discussions took as a given that there would be no compensation -- or U.S. could not enforce a rule of compensation for an expropriation by another country of its own nationals' property. That was a given. The controversial point was the one the United States was urging about whether international law even spoke to the question of expropriating the property of nationals.   And the Restatement and the -- and the expropriation exception are an expression of Congress's view of U.S. policy -- yes, that that does violate international law -- but that's as far as it goes. And that is what Congress was driving at in enacting the FSIA, not opening U.S. courts to broader human rights violation claims. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Barrett. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Mr. Kneedler, I have a question about what the Clarification Act should tell us about the expropriation exception. So, in showing special solicitude for Nazi-era claims, the Clarification Act clearly assumes that some such claims against Nazi-era confiscations of property would be going forward and that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would not bar them. So, if your interpretation of the expropriation exception is correct to say that it applies only when there's a foreign national suing a government for the taking of property, what kind of class of claims are those? I guess that would open up some of the difficult questions of nationality and citizenship that Justice Alito was asking you, but could we expect there would have been or was there a large subset of claims brought against Nazi governments -- Nazi-controlled governments by foreign nationals? What -- what is Congress referring to there? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Well, several things. I mean, like Altmann was a case by a foreign national against -- against Austria, but I think the bigger point is that Congress knew there were such claims, but I don't think that is the same thing as Congress determining that those -- that those could -- that they -- that they fell within the Expropriation Act, and, in fact, again, the Clarification Act simply refers to the taking of property within the meaning of (a)(3), which refers one back to what (a)(3) means. So, really, what Congress was doing was not taking away the opportunity of someone who had such a claim to rely on the loan of property to a U.S. museum as establishing the commercial nexus, but it didn't do more than that. And I think the Court should -- should insist upon a much more explicit and -- and conscious determination by Congress to open up U.S. courts to these sorts of claims, which are far beyond what Congress had in mind when it enacted the FSIA.

Kneedler", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. An important thing to remember here is that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was the codification of the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, and it adopted a general rule of immunity subject to exceptions.   This Court has referred to that as a presumption of immunity.   And this Court should enforce that by insisting upon a clear statement by Congress to depart from the -- from the restrictive theory. The problem here, beyond the statutory text and context and background and structure, is the fact that this would put courts of the United States in the business of making sensitive judgments about the conduct of foreign governments, including perhaps some of our closest allies, and invite other countries to open their courts to claims based on situations in the -- in this country's unfortunate past, where it has committed acts that everyone would now regard as violations of the law of nations. So this Court should adhere to Congress's understanding and intention of limiting the expropriation exception to circumstances involving the taking of property by foreign nationals in the traditional sense of requiring the compensation and not tie it to the violation of international law. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. O'Donnell. "}, {"speaker": "Nicholas M. O'Donnell", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act provides jurisdiction over cases in which rights and property taken in violation of international law are an issue.   The ordinary and natural meaning of that phrase, chosen by Congress, applies to Petitioners' property takings during the Holocaust.   The Nazis deemed German Jews to be non-German, aliens outside of the rule of law, at the moment the regime began on January 30, 1933, and took their property because of who they were. I was puzzled here, the suggestion earlier that we have not raised that issue, because we have framed the case in those terms since the complaint and at every stage since. This Court in Helmerich noted the potential that a sovereign -- sovereign's takings of its own nationals' property may amount to a violation of international law.   If that logic did not apply to Nazi-forced sales from Jews, when would it apply? Petitioner Germany also committed genocide, which is itself a violation of international law.   The Nazi government set out explicitly to destroy the German Jewish people by taking their property.   And Congress has specifically identified the Nazi's looting of art from the Jewish people as genocidal.   This is not a new kind of human rights case.   It's a property rights case. Briefly, with respect to comity, sovereign immunity is the broadest expression of what Justice Breyer this morning called a motivating principle.   And Congress in 1976 created a comprehensive non-discretionary framework for that motivating principle. Petitioners' newfound status-based comity abstention argument would trample the FSIA out of existence.   As Ms. Harrington said, what sovereign defendant would not claim a paramount interest in property within its own territory.   Every one of the takings of property of aliens that Petitioners say are covered by the law would immediately face this assertion. Congress has set the rules, and the Court need not rewrite them.

I think one of the things you see in the Congressional Record, you see in the amicus brief by Mr. Feldman in the Hungary case, for example, is that it was a bit of a jungle as to -- as to how to treat expropriations from citizens. And the Restatement addresses when a taking of property from an alien violates international law, but it's a section about takings from aliens.   And it's not as clearly laid out as the genocide convention, which had been codified all the way back in 1948 and was well within the -- the view of Congress. And the second is this specific historic episode had received considerable treatment by U.S. policymakers and the executive, in particular, the letter from Mr. Tate in 1949 that it was the policy of the executive, never rescinded since, to remove any constraint upon the exercise of jurisdiction over the acts of Nazi officials. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, obviously, there's no issue in this case, but how do you decide in -- in other instances whether or not the taking is in the context of more general violations of human rights so that you call -- fall within this -- in other words, how broadly would you articulate the -- if you want to call it the genocide exception to the normal rule? Now, of course, the first answer is, you know, whatever it is, it covers this case, but do you have a more general rule that would be applied in other situations? "}, {"speaker": "Nicholas M. O'Donnell", "text": " Your Honor, I have two.   The first is when the claim -- that the claim has to sound -- as you said in -- in OBB, the gravamen has to be about the taking of property. And if you look at the other human rights norms in Judge Katsas's dissent, for example, they do not implicate the taking of property.   Torture is not caused by the taking of property.   In fact, the Torture Victim Protections Act specifically eschews torture by deprivation, anything -- or caused by anything other than physical anguish. So the first is the claim that the international human rights norm has to sound in the taking of property in the first instance and that those other norms do not.   And the second position I would say, Your Honor, as the final sort of boundary against all of this is, well, then look to what Congress has said.   Has Congress recognized this episode of property taking as a violation of international law or as genocide? The list -- that list is vanishingly small.   And -- and even though in instances that Congress has recognized as genocide after considerable debate, fewer of those still -- again, the genocide convention has multiple avenues, if you will, to the commission of genocide.

Counsel, can you give me any -- any example of genocide where property has not been involved? It seems like, as I think of whether it's Armenia or the Ukraine or Germany or up in the Baltic States, that whenever that's occurred there's been a loss of property or a taking of property.   So wouldn't virtually every one of those involved be covered by your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Nicholas M. O'Donnell", "text": " Not necessarily, Your Honor, because even those genocides recognized are commonly understood to recognize as such, again, there may be property takings that happen alongside the genocide, but the genocide convention, a genocide can be committed, as I've said, in multiple ways. And if you kill the members of the group and then you take their property, the -- the taking didn't cause the genocide.   It was alongside of it.   But, if you take the property, as Germany did, explicitly to destroy the group of people and remove it from the face of the earth, then you've committed -- committed genocide through the taking of property, which is the focus of the expropriation exception. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I don't understand how it would make a difference to have one sequence versus the other, that you commit the genocide before you take the property or the property before you take the -- the -- before you commit the genocide.

O'Donnell", "text": " With respect, Your Honor, no, because I would submit that if there was any taking of property recognized in 1976 as in violation of the law of nations, it was what this Petitioner did between 1933 and 1945.

And genocide in this way, we -- we can be thankful there are not other examples like it.   It -- it -- it cannot be repeated enough, there is no paradigm like the Holocaust. And there is no second case that fits into the allegations of the Holocaust. Mezerhane, the Eleventh Circuit case relied upon by Petitioners, points this out.   The Venezuelan victims in that case tried to say, well, we -- we are sort of being treated unfairly and like foreign nationals, like the Nazis treated people, and the Eleventh Circuit said that's absurd, that's absurd, there's only one Holocaust.

And, as Justice Thomas, others have pointed out, seems to me there are loads of violations of international law in violating -- in violating -- that involves property, not just genocide. And so an argument that's made against your side is look what you're opening up.   I mean, you can have slavery involving property. You can have systematic discrimination.   You can have cruel and unhuman degrading treatment. I mean, the list goes on and on of what violates international law.   And many of them involve property.   And if we can bring these kinds of actions here, well, so can these other countries do the same and accuse us. I mean, what about Japanese internment, which involved 30,000 people in World War II who were not American citizens but were of Japanese origin? And the first time we'd sue China for the Rohingyas or whatever, you know, what do you think they're going to say about the -- the -- the railroad workers who came to the 19th century?

In this case, if you were interested in the context and you looked to the legislative history, which I urge the Court to do, first, in the 1973 hearing, Hitler's takings of art came up specifically, as well as did other various contexts, like the taking of Lithuanians' property, that made clear that there's no limitation in mind. Again, this was a fairly expansive discussion both in terms of the hearing and the -- and the back and forth.   And as you said earlier in this argument, \"of aliens\" is all over the restatement.   And it's not in this case.   The lodestars are taking without adequate and fair compensation and not for public purpose.   That's arbitrary and discriminatory.

Then you get the Hickenlooper Amendments as well.   And that's all before we even get to some of the other statutory clues that Judge Katsas pointed out. Why doesn't that as a matter of ordinary meaning at the time of the statute's passage stand as pretty strong evidence against you taking collectively? "}, {"speaker": "Nicholas M. O'Donnell", "text": " Because those elements of international law, Your Honor, are -- are restrictive and not defining.   The Restatement Second, Section 185, is in a chapter entitled Taking of the Property of Aliens. So the fact that taking of the property a violation -- taking of the property of aliens violates international law does not mean at the extent of international law. And the Sabbatino/Hickenlooper Amendment bears this out because the second Hickenlooper Amendment refers back to violations of international law, including those in this section.   And those in this section are takings from United States citizens.   So it -- it is -- it is exemplary but not exhaustive. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   And then, if -- if your -- if your contrary reading were correct, I -- I think you've agreed that property -- property takings or taken, if you will, because of a genocide is not going to be the limit of our jurisdiction.

I would have thought terrorism, slavery were a couple of examples we batted around.   I'm sure there are going to be many others.

The commercial activity exception asks if the claim arises out of commercial activity in the United States, and the Court was very clear that that doesn't mean but for.   That doesn't mean alongside of which, right? The plaintiff in that case wouldn't have been injured in Austria if he or she hadn't bought the ticket in the United States, but that wasn't enough. And those other human rights norms that I mentioned and that Judge Katsas mentioned, the violations are not caused by the deprivation of property.

And I think it would have been well understood by that Congress -- I looked this up in the congressional historians -- 40 percent of whom had served in World War II, as had the President. I think, to pose the inverse of a question the Court -- that I think Justice Alito raised in his post-op dissent, I think the Congress would be shocked in 1976 to hear the suggestion that Nazi Germany's property taking didn't violate international law for the whole of the regime.

I'm looking now in -- let me find the -- in (h)(2)(B), if you look down into the subsections, it talks about the taking having occurred after 1900. So the statute does use the word \"taking\" and the way that (h) -- 1606(a)(3) is drafted, it would be hard to say anything other than \"taken.\" So really does your argument depend that much on the distinction between \"taking\" and property \"taken\"?

And it -- and it would make no sense -- this just comes back to the textual principle that I talked about before -- it would make no sense to encompass that whole era if it meant to exclude a certain category of takings and a certain date range that Congress didn't say. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But, Mr. O'Donnell, a lot of the force of your argument depends on the ordinary meaning of the terms and relying just on, you know, \"property taken in violation of international law\" rather than saying it in a term of art way. But, at the same time, you've pointed to all kinds of limitations that might exist outside of that ordinary meaning of the text; for example, this is just genocide or just if Congress calls it genocide. Can you identify some of the limiting principles, say, you said maybe this is just the Holocaust, the Nazi Holocaust, or maybe this is just genocide, maybe it's just a genocide if Congress identifies it as such?

And if you read that and look to the episode in question, you -- you don't have to limit yourself -- I'm not saying you have to limit yourself to the text and learn nothing else from other words or contexts.   I'm not saying that, because, of course, I think the context supplies the answer as well.

Petitioners' argument boils down to this, that despite the absence of language in the FSIA as originally passed that would limit claims based on the nationality of victims of government property takings and despite the presence in the Clarification Act of language specifically recognizing the full extent of the Nazi regime's art looting and forced sales as properly within the expropriation exception, that unique among Nazi victims, Congress intended to disadvantage the Nazi's first victims, German Jews.   This makes no sense. With regard to comity, which I know we did not spend much time on, I would say the FSIA says to district court judges the defendant is immune unless the exception applies, and I think in this circumstance of the game of baseball. The judge in that scenario can be thought of like the umpire in the baseball game, whose rules say the batter gets four balls or three strikes.   Creating a status-based new comity abstention doctrine to avoid the FSIA would be like telling that umpire that, even when the batter strikes out, the umpire can still award first base if the batter is important enough or really wants to get to first base. But to do so would be to legislate where Congress has not.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Three minutes for rebuttal, Mr. Freiman. "}, {"speaker": "Jonathan M. Freiman", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   A couple of small points and then I'll wrap up. First of all, the Clarification Act. I think it's important to remember that it only involves art that is physically present in the United States.   That's a consequential distinction when we're talking about foreign sovereign immunity. Second of all, with regard to what to do if you find that the expropriation exception applies only to violations of the international law of takings, this is not a situation where remand is appropriate. The plaintiffs have never claimed that the consortium or the firms or their ancestors were not German nationals.   You won't find a paragraph in any of the briefs at any stage of this litigation.   This is something that should be resolved finally here. In sum, the Court's been given two literally possible meanings.   Ours is consistent with the background that Congress was legislating against and with the understanding of the term \"taking in violation of international law\" as it was understood in the Restatement, which this Court has used to understand FSIA exceptions in the past. Even if the plain text doesn't decide, you should look to the canons, and all of them cut in our favor.   I'd like to highlight three of them.   First of all, clarity.   In Helmerich, this Court held that clarity in jurisdictional statutes especially regarding foreign sovereigns is particularly important.   It's a doctrine with enormous diplomatic consequences, and Congress knew that clarity was important. It didn't create an exception letting foreign sovereigns be sued for sovereign acts without knowing the boundaries that it was legislating.   Under our interpretation, Congress knew them.   International law of takings, a doctrine that the U.S. had long advocated for with a specific content and coverage. Under the plaintiffs' interpretation, Congress didn't know the boundaries.   It was any principle of international law.   That's a big set, one that can keep changing.   Congress didn't want to lose control of a sensitive diplomatic area like this. Second, their reading would ignore judicial interpretations of the very similar language of the second Hickenlooper Amendment, and there's no doubt that Congress knew of that. The statute was cited in the committee report here, as was a case by this Court, Alfred Dunhill, repeatedly citing the prior judicial interpretation of the second Hickenlooper Amendment just a few months before the FSIA was passed. Third, their reading would violate the international law of state immunity and rip a large hole in the restrictive theory that Congress was codifying.   My friend tries to limit the consequences to genocide, but the genocide -- genocide convention doesn't use the word \"takings\" or \"taken.\" And as several members of the Court have noted today, slavery, systematic racial discrimination, and other norms, like crimes against humanity or the laws of war, can all involve takings. Almost 700 judges, as several of you have noted, would sit as new world courts, judging the nations of the world for alleged violations of international human rights and the law of war. Much more should be required from the text to reach this result.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
