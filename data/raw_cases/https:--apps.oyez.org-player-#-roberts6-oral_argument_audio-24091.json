Lamken", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For nearly 200 years, Congress never enacted a statute that purported to limit the effect to one and only one specified case pending before Article III courts disclaiming any reach beyond that solitary monetary dispute.

But the point, I think the fundamental point is that no future case that's identically situated, no other case except this one case will be subject to this rule.

I think the answer would be the same.   Would be the same.

When Congress is not willing to make the law applicable generally to categories of cases but singles out particular pending cases to alter the course of proceedings -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Is it the -- is it the use of the case name in the -- or the number in the statute that is the offending characteristic? I imagine that a -- a -- a creative drafter could draft a statute that makes no reference to a particular case or to particular cases but could put so many limitations on the scope of the law that, in fact, it applies only to one case or to a small number of cases exactly the ones that Congress wants to target. Congress does that; is it different? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Right.   I -- I think, Your Honor, if Congress so limits and so cabins it that, in effect, it has limited the law to one and one case only, it's inexplicable, except as an effort, to limit it to one case and one case only.   That would fall within our rule as well. And the principle underlying that is that Congress enacts laws; it doesn't adjudicate specific cases. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You know, we -- we had a case.   I don't remember the case name.   I think it dealt with Lampf, which -- which -- in which our Court had come to a surprise decision which shortened what everybody thought had been the statute of limitations for certain securities actions.   Congress passed a law trying to reverse our decision.   It said anybody who had filed the security action prior to the date of this decision would be allowed to refile and proceed to judgment.   We went through a lot of trouble to say that Congress can't do that because it is reversing the outcome of a court judgment.   It would have been so easy to decide that case by saying, my Lord, it's just referring to particular cases. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Well, in fact, the statute at issue in Plaut that -- that reversed Lampf was a generally applicable case to all pending cases.   Its problem is it went too far and addressed cases which had gone final.   And this Court held its authority to adjudicate cases includes the power to conclusively decide them, so it went too far.   But it was a generally applicable statute to all pending cases. This is the exact opposite.   In fact, if this suit were dismissed on a technicality, and identically-situated plaintiffs filed a new one, or these plaintiffs filed a new one and it got a different caption, 8772 would not apply. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " What about the Robertson case? Is -- isn't that the case involving the timber? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Yes.   So Robertson is also a generally applicable statute.   That statute said that for the five statutory provisions that were at issue in the cases, you could comply with those or you could comply with two new provisions, and that would be sufficient for the timber harvesting. But that rule applied not only to those cases, but to any additional cases -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, as Justice Alito indicated, actually it named cases by -- didn't it reference the case by number? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " And the court said it referenced the case by number to identify the statutes that were the basis of the suit.   And, in fact, Subsection (g) of that statute specifically contemplated additional suits challenging timber harvesting, and the new rule, which said Subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) are good enough -- you don't have to comply with the other five statutes -- would apply to those new lawsuits as well. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Where do you get the notion that Congress can only act by generality? It acts all the time on individual matters.   I mean, certainly, you know, grants certain privileges and certain monies on the basis of individual cases. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Justice Scalia, our principle is not that Congress can't act on a certain bridge, a single parcel of land, a single set of presidential papers.   It's that Congress cannot limit its legislation to one and only one case such that it dictates the outcome. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Why is that? So long as it is not overturning a judgment that the court has made in that case, as it did in Lampf or whatever the name -- was it Plaut? I don't think it was Plaut. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Plaut wrote it. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I -- I wrote it.   I just don't remember. (Laughter.) Do you know how many cases I've written? (Laughter.) So long as it doesn't overturn the judgment of the court, you have to be relying on the fact that it cannot act individually.   Is it magic that it -- that the individualized law that it enacts happens to affect a particular case? Why is that magic? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " I think the principle is not whether it happens to affect a particular case. Congress can regularly -- well, often the problems will come to Congress's attention because of cases, and it may enact a law even thinking about that case.   But what Congress can't do is limit its law so that it applies to that case and that case only. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Because it violates what -- what principle? At -- at -- at the end of the day, I suppose maybe bill of attainder if there's a real intent to punish.   Maybe equal protection might work. But I take it you're relying on separation of powers?

Breyer", "text": " What do we do about all of the -- what used to be when I worked in the Senate Judiciary Committee? Every year we would get dozens, maybe hundreds, past dozens of private bills.   There were bills for one person, and moreover, at least some of them, to my recollection, involved that one person saying I tried to sue.   Maybe the case is still there, but I was met with a statute of limitations defense, for example.   I'd like the money.   And we'd vote yes, give him the money, he deserves it, if he does. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " And I think the history of private bills actually proves our point, because the private bills, the vast majority, as you point out, don't affect a specified case at all.   They just simply say you're entitled to your -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, considering the ones that do -- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A.

He was met with some kind of defense, and he thought, and Congress might have thought maybe he should have the money.   This is a technical defense. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A.

I can easily imagine circumstances where to take the money from private B and give it to private A might -- for example, a property without due process.   It might violate some other provision.   But if it doesn't violate some other provision, what in the separation of powers, unsaid principles, distinguishes between taking $10 from the government and giving it to the private person, or taking $10 from Joe Smith and giving it to the private person, assuming there's nothing unfair about that? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Setting aside other constitutional provisions, Justice Breyer, the difference is this: Congress has full power to waive the United States defenses, to relinquish its own claims, to contract or expand its immunity.   But when it comes to a suit between two private parties, the government can't waive one of those party's defenses. And courts -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Because?

The defense -- the defense happened to be -- that worked -- an obscure provision in a court of claims act, that the government through Congress had once put in, and they decided it would be unfair to apply it now to this person, and so they repeal it in respect to that person.   And there's never going to be another like him.   Okay? Now, don't play.   What I don't want you to do is play on the potential unfairness, because there are other parts of the constitution there.   Assume it's fair to do that.   What stops it. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A.

There's no lawsuit yet. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Yes.   From the time of the framing, State courts with comparable constitutions repeatedly concluded that it violates separation of powers for their legislatures to enact a law which had an effect on one case and one case only.

James and Jones v. Perry.

"}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, there's no lawsuit yet.   If you limited it to lawsuit, I'd understand what you're saying.   But you're appealing to a much more general proposition, which is that Congress cannot act individually.   It must enact general laws.   And I just don't agree with that. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Well, Justice Scalia, to be clear, our principle is not that it can act -- must act general laws in the sense that you can't law -- enact a law for one bridge, or one parcel of land, or one set of assets.   It is that it cannot enact something that acts on one case and one case only, purports to have no effect, no -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I don't -- no.   I'm sorry.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sorry, Mr. Lamken. I don't understand the fixation on how many cases we're talking about.   I thought -- I mean, I understand the argument.   But at least I think perhaps the more significant concern is what Congress is doing in that one case, which is you have a body of law that tells you when you can attach funds and when you can't, and instead of letting the court decide, that Congress comes along and says those funds can be attached.   They could do that in two cases.   They could do it in ten.   They could do it in every case involving Iran.   That doesn't seem terribly significant to me.   What seems significant is what they are doing in that case. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " I think that certainly exacerbates the problem.   When Congress does not merely say new law for this particular case, but says new law, plaintiffs win.   That is certainly, certainly, across the line.   And that is effectively what Congress did here.   It enacted a law that said that plaintiffs were able to attach these assets if two conditions are met. But those conditions were clearly met before the law was enacted.   There was only one possible outcome. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Based on what you said this morning, I don't really understand the -- excuse me -- the limiting principle of your argument.   You've said that the number of cases is not determinative, there could be a great many cases.   And you've said that the naming of the -- the cases isn't significant, and it might not even be significant whether the case has been filed yet.   So if you put all that together, what is the principle that you're -- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " So I think for this case, the Court need only rule -- because it was never been -- it wasn't argued below and it wasn't argued in the brief in opposition if it was anything but one case.   The Court could rule simply that when Congress singles out one case and one case only, that crosses the line. Apart from that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But that seems silly -- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Apart from that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- Mr. Lamken, and that's why you've been saying that the number doesn't matter, and it doesn't matter whether it's the day before or the day after suit, and it doesn't matter if Congress has specified the docket number because any of those limitations, you would say, well, Congress could do, you know, pretty much the exact same thing except it would be in two cases, or except it would be without the docket number.   And your answers suggest how, you know, a little bit nonsensical those distinctions would be. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Let me explain why I wouldn't be concerned and then give you the principle that would govern the remaining cases. I would not be concerned about the limiting principle here because Congress, for 200 years, didn't get near this line because States, for almost 200 years, have had the exact same principles.   And yet, there's no history, no debate, no series of cases determining did -- did their legislatures cross the line. The rule that I would give to address that is, simply put, if it's not listing particular cases, then Congress isn't going to cross the line so long as it doesn't dictate the outcome for a set of cases where there's only one liable party and it's unwilling -- and it's willing to make it a perspective in effect. But if Congress dictates the outcome, and there's only one liable defendant, and Congress is unwilling to make that perspective, that's dictating outcomes of cases.   It is not legislation as we understand it. The framing generation certainly understood that that's something that purported to act on one case and one case only, or a handful of specified cases crossed the line from legislation to judicial decision making and violated our -- and violated the separation of powers. This Court likewise should understand that when Congress purports to act on one case, and if that case is dismissed and they're identical plaintiffs, file the identical suit, and it gets a different case number, yet the law doesn't apply, that law has no existence apart from dictating an outcome in a case -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why doesn't it make a difference that this is in the area of foreign affairs? I had thought that our cases were pretty clear that the political branches -- especially the executive, so I concede that there's a difference there -- but that the political branches have a great deal of power in this area, even when it comes to very particular controversies. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Right.   And I think the government's examples prove exactly why Congress crossed the line here.   Now, I'm going to start with sovereign immunity, foreign sovereign immunity, and the history of the executive determining sovereign immunity and the courts universally respecting it.   And that's because sovereign immunity was a matter of comity, grace, and international politics.   And the courts would respect the executives' determinations because they did not want to embarrass the executive or create an international incident by assuming jurisdiction where the executives told them not to. But State law and the UCC are not matters of grace, comity, or international politics.   They are matters of law for the courts to decide. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, perhaps -- perhaps they are when the assets are held by a country as to which we have very delicate relations with matters particularly involving dangerous acts allegedly perpetrated by that country. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Justice Kennedy, I don't think the executive branch would submit to the courts a suggestion of State law because foreign affairs principles were at issue, and expect the States -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Any suggestion -- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " A suggestion of State law as opposed to a suggestion of immunity, because the State law is something that has existence apart from what the executive believes the right -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " The State law is what would apply, perhaps, in the absence of a congressional statute.   So the President goes to Congress and says, what I would like is you to agree with me about this. We've frozen $14 billion worth of assets of a country with which we are not friendly.   There are some people who would like some of that money.   We would like to take the assets which are currently being held in the 14th floor of the Howard Building in Chicago and use that.   Why? We want to use that because we've worked out that that's the best way to pay people we think should be deserving money, and we don't care about the foreign country in respect to those.   But our foreign relations are such that we don't want to get the others involved.   Now what's wrong with that? "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Justice Breyer, if I understand the hypothetical, the executive's authority to implement the law -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No.   I'll -- the hypothetical is meant to say just what Justice Kennedy brought up, which is the President, particularly when he acts together with Congress, is given the foreign affairs power to a very great extent of the United States of America.   And that foreign affairs power could often involve, for reasons of foreign policy, unfreezing a refrigerator and not unfreezing the stove. So I don't -- I don't know foreign affairs, but I do know that the President, together with Congress, certainly must have very broad power to decide what assets shall or shall not be kept frozen and not kept frozen. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " So if the President were given the power to confiscate and distribute these assets, which frankly he has not, if he were given that power, that would exacerbate the separation of powers problem, because the executive branch and the political branches should take accountability for seizing the assets, confiscating them, distributing them.   But they cannot, cannot attempt to give it an air of judicial legitimacy by commandeering one case and one case only, like -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Suppose there's -- suppose Iran were holding a great many American hostages, and Iran said, we'll release these hostages if you stop execution in a suit like this.   And suppose Congress thought that that was a good deal and -- and said exactly that. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Right.   And that is the other authority that the Federal government invokes, which is this Court has said is very circumscribed, which is the claims settlement authority, which is the government can settle the claims of its own nationals if there is an international agreement or a court which it is attempting to implement.   But you can't extrapolate from that to the ability to settle the claims, eliminate the claims and defenses of a foreign national when there is no settlement agreement or anything of that sort. This is unprecedented in foreign relations otherwise for a statute to say in this case and this case only, here's the result. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I'm not quite sure I understood that answer, and -- and you're -- you're suggesting that if Congress has a good reason to extinguish these claims, then Congress can do it, but if not, not.

But Congress did not reflect in the statute -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " No.   I said Congress passes a statute that basically -- "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Yeah.

Kennedy", "text": " Well, your -- your answers seem to be that if the President does something, that he has more power, more authority than when the President acting with Congress does something.   I would think it would be just the opposite. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think the -- the -- if Congress delegates the power to the President, that's one thing.   If Congress purports to, for example, in sovereign immunity, in 200 years there's no incident that I know of where Congress has said, in this case and this case only, we've determined whether there should be sovereign immunity.   Typically that is -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I assume that the President signed this legislation.   This wasn't a veto override. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " No.   The President signed a very large piece of legislation which included this piece of it.   But I think the point of the matter is, if the political branches want to confiscate assets and distribute them, they should take accountability for that.

And that authority under Dames and Moore has been carefully circumscribed to cases where the United States has a settlement agreement or an international accord, and it is implementing the accord by settling the claims of its own nationals.

It's a particular property. What Congress did in Section 8772 is act pursuant to its core constitutional authority by legislating changes in substantive laws.

This Court found that that violated the separation of powers, but that the change of the statute of limitations and the opinion for the Court in that case by Justice Scalia points out specifically that Congress can legislate to change an element of a cause of action, to change a rule of evidence that's an impediment to the plaintiff recovering, and can change the statute of limitations.

Can you imagine that rule? I'm just trying -- it's something like a Spendthrift trust or what I'm trying to do is get a Spendthrift trust in the Federal context.

There's already been fines imposed with respect to the laundering of these funds that put them in the United States.

Olson", "text": " Well, Congress has made a determination by using its power to change something that will affect the outcome of a case.   Every time Congress passes a statute, it affects the outcome of future cases and pending cases.   The Schooner Peggy said that Congress may do that, and that had to do with the Treaty, in connection with the pending case.   And until that case is final, Congress can change the substantive law.   And if that is the import of Justice Kagan's question, which I take it to be, that is within Congress's power.   There's no limiting principle.   We heard it today.   The single pending case was -- that was mentioned 25 times in Petitioner's brief went out the window.   Now it can be, well, two cases, nine cases, seven cases.   What is the limiting principle here? There are limiting principles in the Constitution, specific provisions.   But we're talking about separation of powers.   And what this Court has said repeatedly is if the legislation can be interpreted as changing the underlying substantive law, that is not -- whether it's particularized or not and even if it's a legitimate class of one, as that footnote in the Plaut case says.

I -- what I would say, Your Honor, is that Congress does all the time with respect to particularized legislation favoring a particular individual or not favoring a particular individual.

Kneedler", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: This Court has held since the days of the Schooner Peggy that Congress may amend the law and make it applicable to pending cases, and the court must give effect to that law.

Kneedler", "text": " I -- I think not, Justice Kagan.   And there's several important principles underlying that. One, the Footnote 9 in -- in this Court's decision in Plaut said that there -- that imposing individual duties or liabilities on a particular person; in other words, a particular law, private law, there's no limitation on that in the U.S. Constitution. Counsel for Petitioner has mentioned various State law decisions that have said special bills are not permitted.   This Court's decision in Paramino distinguishes those cases and said, yes, some State constitutions have that, but the Federal Constitution, as a matter of separation of powers, has no limitation on special laws. There may be equal protection issues, bill of attainder issues, or special Article I powers like bankruptcy, where there -- where there's a Uniformity Clause and you can't have a statute affecting a particular case or dispute. The second point is if Congress is able to legislate with respect to a specific dispute, and it's done it, for example, with respect to railroad labor disputes at -- in the Maine Central case, and this Court's decision on Burlington Northern mentioned there, where Congress -- there's a labor dispute, Congress comes along and prescribes the results of that dispute.

The -- the straightforward principle is whether Congress is amending the law or whether Congress -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   But then -- "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The question that I gave Mr. Olson -- and I -- I'm searching here for an answer -- is -- is what happens if rather than just picking the winner, Congress amends the law, tweaks the law, modifies the law in such a way -- as to only this case -- in such a way that it's absolutely clear that the effect of that will be to pick a winner? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " I think if Congress is amending the law, it can do that.   And let -- for example, in the Schooner Peggy, which involved an international treaty in -- in the court of foreign relations, and that's another reason why what Congress did here, I think the court should owe special deference to. But in the Schooner Peggy, if there had been only one -- that was a treaty that required each party, the United States and France, to restore ships to the other nation.

It refers to a case by number, the statute.   Before you is the fact that anyone can join, and there are hundreds or dozens of such plaintiffs.   And moreover, on the other side, it -- it refers to $1.75 billion worth of assets in all kinds of different securities and obligations, and now perhaps in cash being held in New York. So whatever we're talking about, though the number suggests a particular case, the facts of the case suggest far more generality than is true of most cases. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S.

It is a pool of assets that, under this Court's decision in James and Moore, emphasizes the need for Congress and the President to be able to take hold of assets, whether it's a small amount or not for two principal reasons: To use as a bargaining chip and also to compensate people who may be injured.   And -- and frankly, also to sanction. This law does both of those things.   It -- it -- the -- the freezing of these assets is a bargaining chip, and you don't have to bargain -- pay all your chips at one time.   A bargaining chip may mean you want to use the -- one bargaining chip, one set of assets this time and hold off on the other ones.

That -- that refers tray under a number of issue that were briefed in the court of appeals on -- on that question.   So we have not taken a position on that.

And if -- if a pending lawsuit would prohibit, would -- would interfere with the flexibility of the executive and Congress to solve a dispute by disposing of assets to pay particular judgments, that's exactly what the Court feared in Dames v.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you -- thank you, counsel. Mr. Lamken, you have six minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Jeffrey A. Lamken", "text": " Thank you. I'd like to begin by going back in history to answer Justice Kennedy's question about a law that says we're going to lift the statute of limitations from one plaintiff and one plaintiff only and nobody else. And the answer to that is early in the nation's history, State court after State court said, You cannot do that.   It violates separation of powers. And the amazing part is not just that those courts held, but there's no case that can be cited by anyone saying that that is actually consistent with separation of powers from early in the framing, much less a law that goes further and effectively says that not only are you going to lift the statute of limitations, but we're going to change the loss.   On this one case, plaintiff wins and defendant loses. That is completely foreign to our legal traditions.   It's completely foreign to history.   And for 200 years, Congress never once enacted a law like that.   That reticence would be amazing if it were not but the fact that Congress understood that that was constitutionally prohibited.

Lamken", "text": " That -- that is one, but it could have been the same thing in Plaut, that for 200 years Congress thought it was unfair to get rid of a final judgment and eliminate repose. But the matter of the fact is that the fact that is also unfair, the fact that there may be individual liberty guarantees associated with it, doesn't mean it's not a separation of powers problem. Because separation of powers protects this Court. It doesn't -- and it does -- when it does so, it also has the effect of guaranteeing fairness and individual liberties for individuals. So separation of powers is important even if one would think that the law might be unconstitutional on other grounds. It's this Court's authority to say what the law is and to decide cases, without Congress passing a law saying, for this one case and this one case only. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

We think they should have that.   They should -- others could have the other thing. I mean, maybe it violates equal protection; maybe it violates due process, depending on how they do it.

Don't seek recourse through judiciary; seek recourse before Congress for your private dispute.
