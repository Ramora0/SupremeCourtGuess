[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-737, Ortiz v. Jordan.   Mr. Mills? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Denial of summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal after trial, especially where the decision depends on whether the evidence on the merits of the claim is sufficient to cross the legal line for liability.   In this case-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I'm sorry to interrupt so quickly, but that especially I take it -- I take it as a concession that there's a difference between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence and claims that are based on law. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --Well, there's a difference between defenses that depend on the evidence at trial.   What I would say about qualified immunity is that to the extent any court of appeals is going to enter judgment based on qualified immunity, it needs to understand the conduct of the officials in the case.   And so you're always talking about the evidence of that conduct. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, of course there is always -- there are always facts.   There are often disputed facts.   But suppose the issue is whether or not this right -- and maybe there are two rights here -- this right was clearly established.   That is an issue of law. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " That is -- that is an issue of law, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And doesn't that fall within the \"except\" clause that the Chief Justice was talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to fill out, I understand.   But -- well, if you're going to say -- and it's really not whether the summary judgment is appealed.   That's a little bit -- it's whether or not the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are appealable.   As I read into your response or implied from your response to what the Chief Justice said, maybe sometimes the summary judgment motion, say on an issue of law, is sufficient to preserve the issue. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Well, and that gets to what I think is the heart of the split in the circuits and the confusion, is that every circuit recognizes a very general rule that where the evidence at trial moots that at summary judgment we are not going to review the summary judgment decision.   Now, a number of courts said: Well, wait a second; there are summary judgment issues that don't depend on the evidence.   Those are typically called questions of law, and Respondents point to a number of good examples in their brief of defenses such as statute of limitations, preemption, and the like, that indeed very often don't depend at all on the evidence at trial.   The difference with qualified immunity is that qualified immunity requires the court to look at the evidence of the claim itself.   Now, statute of limitations, for example, is actually quite different, because in statute of limitations -- let's suppose Michelle Ortiz filed her suit 20 years late.   It would not matter at all how much evidence she adduced of the Respondents' misconduct.   It would be barred by statute of limitations. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So Mr. Mills, what then is the difference?   You point out, quite rightly, summary judgment looks to what evidence there was and the question for the Court is: What could the plaintiff prove?   When we get past trial, the issue becomes: What has the plaintiff proved?   So what was brought out at trial?   What was the record at trial that was larger than the record at summary judgment?   Because if there was no -- no new fact presentation, no more ample fact presentation, then it wouldn't matter.   It would be the same body of evidence, right? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Well, I think that's largely -- largely right, Justice Ginsburg, and here's an example of what did change in this case.   At the summary judgment stage, what we had were affidavits of the Respondents discussing their role in relation to this case, with no comment whatsoever about what the consequences would have been had Ms. Jordan immediately reported the first sexual assault.   The record was bare at summary judgment from Respondents' perspective on that point.   At trial, under cross-examination Ms. Bright testified that Respondent Jordan indeed violated prison policy by not reporting it and then, very crucially, also agreed that the second, more violent assault would have actually been precluded had that report taken place.   Now, that's-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " This gets to what troubles me about this case.   Although the Sixth Circuit referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at trial and determined that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at trial.   So I don't know why this case actually presents the question on which cert was granted.   It seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely factual question in the end, whether there was -- whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate.   And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law.   You never raised in the court of appeals, as I understand it, the argument that the defendants' ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter of law was waived because they never filed the Rule 50(b) motion.   Isn't that right? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --Well, there's a couple points in there that I need to address.   First, I think that you are exactly right.   What the Sixth Circuit did here is it reviewed a summary judgment decision, but it did peek ahead to the trial evidence, and it said it was doing that.   I think that highlights the fundamental problem of reviewing summary judgment after the trial.   The Sixth Circuit is implicitly recognizing it would be illogical to look at that summary judgment record, those affidavits, and then ignore this cross-examined testimony-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, suppose we were to hold that they couldn't review the denial of summary judgment.   The case is remanded to them and they say: Okay, well, we made a slip of the pen when we referred to summary judgment in the prior decision.   We really were saying that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law and, although there wasn't a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't raised on appeal.   So we are -- we come back to exactly where we are now.   All we have done is to correct a slip of the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is jurisdictional.   But it really is not under our cases distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and claims processing questions. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --And I agree with that last point.   But here's the problem and here's why it isn't just simply a slip of the pen that can be fixed by remanding.   Even if this was not summary judgment whatsoever and it was, as Respondents say, essentially a Rule 50(a) review, that conflicts with an entire line of this Court's decisions leading into Unitherm which makes clear that the court of appeals absolutely lacks the power to review the sufficiency of the evidence where that question wasn't ruled upon by the district court.   And so the court of appeals here, regardless of any sort of forfeiture argument, absolutely lacked the power to consider it.   The additional point about your-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But that's not the point that you have made here, I mean, and that is not the point on which we granted certiorari. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --That's right and I think -- I think what I just said about the 50(b) point is that I think it highlights that this really was a summary judgment review by the Sixth Circuit. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Mills, if I could just understand your answer to Justice Alito.   You concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the record built on the whole trial and that that's a different record from the record that existed at summary judgment; is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " I do concede it, except to the extent that I concede they did an adequate review of the record.   But I concede that point.   For example-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So they have that first paragraph where they suggest that they're ruling on a summary judgment motion.   Then they go through an entire opinion that talks about the facts and the record.   And there are very few citations, but your understanding is that when they talk about the facts in the record they are talking about the post-trial, I mean the record that has been built up as a result of the trial? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --There are certainly a number of instances where they definitely are talking about the trial.   I do think it is even muddy the extent to which they are incorporating trial facts with summary judgment facts.   The example I gave about this point where Mrs. Bright conceded on cross that Ms. Ortiz indeed would have been separated and the assault, second assault, precluded, it's one of two things.   Either the Sixth Circuit's reviewing summary judgment and picking a couple of trial facts it thinks helps to review and missing the facts; or it's doing -- it's looking ahead at these trial facts and because -- particularly because the district court never weighed in on that, on a Rule 50(b), it's botching the record.   And it goes to the heart of this Court's cases from Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper in 1947 up through Unitherm, which says we have to have the district court review the sufficiency of the evidence before the court of appeals could even have the power to possibly consider this. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That answer is not addressing Justice Alito's point, which he said a Rule 50 motion is not jurisdictional.   You are in essence claiming it is.   You are saying they lacked the power, but Justice Alito's question to you said they don't, that they've misread the fact that this is not a jurisdictional motion.   So address that question: Why is it jurisdictional as opposed to a claim processing? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Your Honor, I am not disputing that the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to consider the case.   But I am making a distinction among jurisdiction and power, and it's the same distinction actually the Tenth Circuit employed in a case called Williams v. Gonterman, which is cited in our reply brief, I think it's at page 10.   But the exact issue came up, where the verdict loser said: Wait a second; this issue's been forfeited.   The Tenth Circuit, reading Unitherm, reading the debate between the majority and the dissenters, who said plain error and those doctrines should apply, said: We lack the power to review this; we have jurisdiction, but we lack the power. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " In claim processing rules we have said that, unless you object, the court doesn't lack power.   Since you didn't object below to a argument that Rule 50(b) precluded consideration by the court of appeals, why wasn't that argument waived before the court? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " It's not waived because, while the general principle is that claims processing rules are indeed subject to waiver and forfeiture, in this particular context, as this Court has made clear, that the word \"power\" is not an accidental use.   It's been used in all these cases. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Why is it -- power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a case.   But we are in an area where there are many, many cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a), 50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule because in the background is the Seventh Amendment re-examination clause.   That's the whole reason why there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser must repeat the 50(a) motion, after the verdict.   So I'm surprised that you're using the word \"power\" and you're not referring to any of that history which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh Amendment. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Well, Justice Ginsburg, you are absolutely correct and I think that footnote 4 of Unitherm goes right to your point.   In footnote 4 of Unitherm, the Court explains that the very reason a court of appeals lacks the power, lacks the power to review that question, is because it is essentially, as in Unitherm, going to be as a court of appeals reviewing the conduct -- the sufficiency of the evidence, without a district court ruling on the question.   And this Court said in Unitherm that that raises serious Seventh Amendment concerns.   This case is actually a very good example-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Mills, I got you started on this, but none of this is the question on which we granted review, is it?   We didn't grant review to decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a 50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that issue was waived by failing to make the motion.   We didn't grant review on that. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --Justice Alito, that highlights another important point about this exchange, and that is that Respondents in the Sixth Circuit did not suggest that the Sixth Circuit did have the authority to take the summary judgment question and then look ahead to trial facts.   And so, the Sixth Circuit has taken the summary judgment decision and then acted without authority to look ahead at the trial facts.   And so if the argument is that we have forfeited a preemptive argument to the Sixth Circuit that it couldn't do this frankly very unorthodox approach, I don't think that that's a proper invocation of forfeiture even regardless of the point about power. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Are you saying then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the trial record, so it's different from the summary judgment stage, if we told them that then maybe they would look at the evidence differently, even though they purported to look at the trial evidence? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Well, I think if that order were given they would indeed do that.   But I would still come back to the point that there is absolutely no basis on which they would have the authority to do that.   And the point is in the Unitherm line of cases that if you don't have a district court ruling on the very question, the question here of whether their conduct, as they say crossed, the constitutional line, you're circumventing the district court's role in the entire process.   As this Court's explained repeatedly, a requisite of a court of appeals reviewing that evidence that went to the jury is that the district court first, who has the feel of the case, who saw the witnesses, who saw Respondent Bright on cross-examination, first have the opportunity in the judge's discretion to grant a new trial. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So if you're right, then there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with instructions to send the case back to the district court to ask the district court whether it thought the evidence was sufficient? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " I don't think so, Your Honor.   I think that the best way to see this case is it's indeed a review of the summary judgment decision.   That's the only decision by the district court that had to do with qualified immunity.   The Sixth Circuit expressly invoked an exception to say, we can review summary judgment after the trial because its qualified immunity and the Eighth Circuit said that's okay and we say that's okay, we are looking ahead at trial facts.   And I think what this Court can and should conclude is that it's improper to review the summary judgment decision after trial because the facts have changed. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And your argument is that where the district court denies summary judgment on a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that purely legal question is renewed in the Rule 50(b) motion.   That's your argument? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " That is my argument, with a couple key pieces -- first of all, they could of course take a collateral order appeal.   But if they proceed to trial -- and here's -- here's sort of the fundamental point about qualified immunity.   Sure, there are purely legal questions in the qualified immunity inquiry.   Was the right clearly established?   But to enter judgment, to enter judgment, whether it's the district court or the court of appeals, that court must know what the conduct is. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But what if the facts are utterly undisputed?   There is a videotape of exactly what went on.   Nobody has the slightest disagreement about the facts.   The only question is whether the right was clearly established, and the district court rejects that at summary judgment.   What benefit -- what is the point of saying that the defendants have to raise that same issue again in the Rule 50(b) motion?   It's utterly a -- a pointless exercise. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Well, it's certainly a less compelling case than this one where the facts indeed change.   But I would say that there -- it's not utterly pointless because the 50(b) motion still invokes all the protections that this Court has described where the district court, who had the feel of the case, gets the first chance to consider whether a new trial should be granted. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Mills, when -- when Unitherm talks about the district court feeling the case and having a feel for the case, it's talking about having ae feel for the evidence and for the facts.   The whole rationale of Unitherm is based on the evidence, the facts, not on purely legal questions.   So suppose we disagree with you about the reach of Unitherm.   Suppose we say Unitherm doesn't have any application to purely legal questions.   What would that mean for your case?   Which part of your claims were purely legal and which part were instead founded on the facts, in which case you would have a better Unitherm argument? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " It -- it would still mean you would have to reverse in this case, and I think in Justice Alito's hypothetical perhaps, perhaps not.   But in this case, as -- as Respondents themselves say, the question here is actually very simple.   It's whether their conduct crossed a constitutional line.   And the point is that, even in the qualified immunity inquiry, the question is does the conduct -- and that's conduct in one way at summary judgment and another way at trial -- does that conduct cross a clearly established constitutional line. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I don't understand, counsel, how your argument that in every case you need to know the facts, every qualified immunity case you need to know the facts, and those only come out at trial -- is consistent with our recognizing that you can have a collateral order appeal of denial of summary judgment.   In other words, you can consider qualified immunity without knowing how the facts are going to come out at trial, which is why we allow you to have an appeal before trial. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " You are absolutely right.   And at summary judgment officers are entitled to invoke immunity and they are entitled to take that immediate appeal, and it's typically -- well, required under Johnson v. Jones that it be what this Court's called a question of law.   The defendants assume the facts against them and they say to the court of appeals, it may be a purely legal question, like this isn't clear -- this is clearly established, or isn't clearly established.   But to -- to say whether that line is crossed, I mean, as recently as Iqbal this Court's-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, so you are just saying your case on qualified immunity isn't like that case; Is that all? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --Well, I'm saying it -- it's like that case to the extent that the court still has to understand, if it's going to enter judgment, what the conduct was.   Even if it's looking at purely-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " No, it doesn't -- doesn't have to know what it was.   It assumes it to be what -- what the plaintiff claims it was. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " At the summary judgment, you give the benefit of the doubt to the plaintiff.

Mills", "text": " That's right.   And I -- I think that bolsters my point.   There is always a factual element to the ruling.   And so when you go to trial and you put on a trial that is all about Respondents' conduct, and you have them under cross-examination and that evidence grows of their misconduct, then we are talking about a situation where they-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It's never going to be any better than what you assumed.   It's never going to be any better for the plaintiff than what you assumed at the summary judgment stage. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --Your Honor, it actually was in this case.

"}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --Why was that? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " It was -- one example I gave earlier: Ms. Ortiz before trial didn't have knowledge of what would have happened had Mrs. Jordan not violated prison procedures and immediately reported the first assault.   On cross-examination, however, Mrs. Bright at page 242 of the trial transcript said:   \"The second assault, the violent assault, would have been precluded. \"   Now, it seems to me, again reading the cold transcript-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It just -- just finish: Because if Ms. Jordan had reported the incident that she was required to, they would have put Ms. Ortiz in segregation automatically; is that it?

Mills", "text": " --Not that they would have put her in segregation, but that they would have taken steps to separate her from the officer, whether that meant removing the officer from the location or putting her in another cell.   The important piece of that is not only did it change from summary judgment to trial; the Sixth Circuit got it entirely wrong. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But you have an obligation in opposing summary judgment to, in your list of disputed facts or facts that preclude summary judgment, to put all that in.   And why didn't you put the point you are raising now in the opposition to summary judgment? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " That is not something Ms. Ortiz would have knowledge of.

There was a summary judgment motion, right?   And it was denied. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " That's right.

Mills", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, I -- I just can't see how Ms. Ortiz would have an obligation to put in some fact that is outside of her knowledge and, frankly, something that came out when a Respondent caved in a bit on cross-examination.

And it may be that everybody, including the Sixth Circuit, misapprehended the rule because there are some cases that depend on AN assessment of the record and some cases that don't, but that's not what the Sixth Circuit said.

Some are purely factual.   Some are in the middle.   Wouldn't it be easier if we just said: Here's the rule from now on, you've got to renew them all in a 50(b) motion and that makes it a lot easier for the trial courts and the appellate courts to figure out when they have to -- when they can consider it and when they can't.

And in this case, I think there is an example of this distinction.   There was very much disputed at trial the question of whether Ms. Ortiz told Ms. Jordan the name of the guard who had assaulted her.   And that fact was disputed at trial.   We didn't move for 50(b) over that factual dispute and so we couldn't appeal on that question.

Let's take -- is it Ms. Bright where the Sixth Circuit said that, well, maybe there could have been a retaliation claim, but the Plaintiff didn't make it?   The district judge, given the chance, might have said: I would exercise my discretion to allow the Plaintiff to have a new trial on this retaliation claim.

And the further argument that a 50(b) motion was required here under Unitherm were never made in the Sixth Circuit and not made in her opening cert petition, and so that argument also was not presented by this case.   And so I think the clear resolution is to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, but if the Court were inclined to view that the merits should be breached, then the clear rule that we posit resolves the case, which is that orders made by the district court along the way in the course of a district court proceeding are adequately preserved for appellate review from the final judgment once they are pressed and passed on below If there are no further questions-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

Mr. Mills, you have three minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Thank you.   One thing that's important about the Sixth Circuit's language when it said it was reviewing summary judgment, the single decision it cited was the Eighth Circuit's decision in Goff v. Bise.   Now, in that -- in that decision, the Eighth Circuit said yeah, we can review this after trial even though it was summary judgment, because it's qualified immunity, but the Eighth Circuit actually ignored the trial evidence.   It actually did this seemingly illogical step of just looking at the summary judgment evidence as-is.   Now, I think what that shows is the Sixth Circuit was definitely reviewing summary judgment but it, implicitly at least, recognized that would be entirely illogical.   So it tied its decision to the only decision by the district court on qualified immunity, summary judgment, and said: We've got to look at what really happened in this case.   And so they looked ahead.   Now, the reason the question is adequately presented is because I think the Sixth Circuit's decision shows this entire debate about Unitherm and whether this was a quasi-50(a) review is one of the precise reasons the Sixth Circuit hinged its decision on summary judgment.   I think it was quite aware that an appellate court, since at least 1947, in Cone, cannot review the sufficiency of the evidence at trial and overturn the jury's verdict.   And so the Sixth Circuit said: Wait a second; we can look to the summary judgment record.   Now-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What's the rule you want us to adopt to answer the question presented?   You asked us to take cert on a question presented.   What is the answer you want us to give on the question presented? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " --Yes.   The answer is that a party may not appeal a denial of summary judgment after trial. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " In no circumstances? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " I would say that the clearest rule is to say that in no circumstances.   That's the position of the Fourth Circuit.   You say if you want counsel judgment, simply make your motion.   But I would add that whichever way this court goes, the decision here has to be reversed, because there is no doubt that the legal issue of qualified immunity at summary judgment depended entirely on the officer's conduct at trial. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So your rule, in response to Justice Sotomayor, would basically require anyone who has an assertion of qualified immunity to take their collateral appeal or interlocutory appeal. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " It would only require it, Your Honor, to the extent that they wish to challenge that decision on the summary judgment record.   I am not at all suggesting that that appeal is required to preserve the issue of immunity.   It's easily preserved, but to the extent a trial occurs on the officer's conduct and the officers want to say: Wait a second, we're still immune, that evidence even at trial is insufficient for liability.   You have got the right to preserve your immunity issue, but you have to have the district court consider the question. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So they are put to a choice whether or not their qualified immunity claim rests entirely on law or might turn out, as you say it did in your case, to have some factual aspect? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, that's kind of a tough choice to put them to, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " Well, they have an absolute right to take that immediate appeal and -- and they chose not to. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So they have to take the immediate appeal, and when they do so, they lose the right to appeal at the end? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " No, they do not. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, why is that? "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " They do not because if they lose the appeal and they go to trial, you've got a new case.   You've got -- I shouldn't say a new case.   You have got new evidence of conduct.   So there is no loss of the issue of immunity.   It is just that it turns on the facts from the trial. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " You assumed all the evidence in their favor at the summary judgment stage.   So do you really think that this is a realistic scenario where there's going to be even more evidence against them than -- I mean, you are assuming the evidence against them.   There is going to be even more evidence against them than they assumed at summary judgment?   That's not going to happen very often. "}, {"speaker": "David E. Mills", "text": " It happened here.
