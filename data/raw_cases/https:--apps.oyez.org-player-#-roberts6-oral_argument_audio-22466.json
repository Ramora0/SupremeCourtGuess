[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-8145, Smith v. Cain.   Mr. Shanmugam. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established the now-familiar principle that the prosecution must hand over all favorable material evidence to the defense before trial.   This case presents a flagrant violation of that principle.   The Orleans Parish district attorney's office produced almost no relevant evidence to the defense before Petitioner's trial, and Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder based solely on the testimony of a single eyewitness.   Unbeknownst to the defense, however, that eyewitness had told the police on multiple occasions that he could not identify any of the perpetrators or, as he put it, that he would not know them if he saw them.   The suppression of those statements alone justifies a new trial, but the district attorney's office in this case also engaged in the wholesale suppression of statements of numerous other witnesses, statements that further undermined the sole eyewitness identification of Petitioner and, more broadly, cast doubt on Petitioner's involvement and role in the shooting.   If all of that information had been disclosed to the defense before trial, the jury surely would have viewed this case in a completely different light.   The trial court therefore erred by rejecting Petitioner's Brady claim, and its judgment should be reversed.   In our view, in order to conclude that Petitioner is entitled to a new trial here, this Court need do nothing more than to consider the suppressed statements of the key eyewitness, Larry Boatner.   Respondent concedes that those statements were withheld from the defense before trial, and argues only that the failure to disclose those statements was not prejudicial.   Those statements, however, could not have more clearly contradicted Boatner's confident identification of Petitioner at trial-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Wasn't there a picture?   Boatner saw a picture in the newspaper and that turned on the light for him; right?   It wasn't any police suggestion? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --That is correct.   The basis for Boatner's identification was that he saw a photograph in the New Orleans newspaper of Petitioner.   It was in connection with an article describing the shootings and suggesting that Petitioner was one of the suspects in the case.   And that was what led to his prior identification out of court.   But just to be clear, Justice Ginsburg, we are not arguing today that the identification was somehow constitutionally problematic.   At most, we are arguing that the identification was of questionable validity in light of the fact that Boatner had only a limited opportunity to see the perpetrators and in light of the circumstances that led to his identification.   Now, even if his identification were more clearly reliable, our argument today would be the same.   In a case such as this one, in which the sole basis for linking the defendant to the crime is the testimony of a single eyewitness, and there is evidence that the single eyewitness said on multiple occasions that he couldn't identify anyone, we believe that, absent extraordinary circumstances, that will be sufficient to-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, aren't you exaggerating a little bit about the value of the impeachment evidence regarding Boatner?   My understanding is that he made his first statement to the effect that he couldn't identify anybody at the scene, when he had been at the scene where five people that he knew very well had been killed.   He was lying on the floor with a big gash on his head.   He was questioned at the scene, and at that time -- this was in the evening -- he said: I can't identify anybody.   But then later that very day, wasn't it?   That very evening, after midnight, he was questioned at the police station.   Am I correct. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --Yes.   That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And at that point he gave a description.   He did make an -- he did provide a description of the person that he said was the one who first came through the door.   So, you know, that -- I don't know -- and then later, he said he -- there were statements to the effect that he couldn't identify anybody.   But in light of the fact that he did provide a pretty, you know, somewhat detailed description on the very evening of the event, doesn't that -- aren't you exaggerating when you say that he said numerous times -- the effect of these statements that he couldn't-- "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Justice Alito, it is true that Boatner provided identifying details in the later statement that night.   I would respectfully submit that they were relatively limited identifying details, simply the fact that the first man through the door had a low cut haircut and gold teeth.   And as we indicate in our brief, those were characteristics shared by numerous other suspects in the case.   But I think more broadly, with regard to both sets of statements at issue here, the State's explanations for those statements are at best plausible.   And we really think that in a case such as this one, in which the evidence on its face is so clearly of high exculpatory or impeaching values, it takes something more than that.   It is not sufficient for Respondent to argue here simply that, even taking into account these statements, a rational juror could still reach the same result and return a verdict of guilty here.   Because this Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that the standard for Brady claims is not a Jackson v. Virginia type sufficiency of the evidence standard.   So again, where you have statements on their face are not simply statements calling a witness' credibility into question, but statements that really directly contradict the confident in-court identification, it would take an exceedingly persuasive explanation for those statements to defeat a showing of materiality. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " The standard is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different, reasonable probability? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Yes, that's correct.   And this Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that that's not a more likely than not standard.   That is essentially the same standard that this Court has articulated for prejudice for ineffective assistance of counsel claims, under Strickland v. Washington, and by now it's a quite clearly established standard.   And again it requires something less than a showing of more likely than not and perhaps something slightly more than the showing required for harmless error under Chapman v. California.   But I do want to touch upon the State's explanations for these statements and explain very briefly why we think that those explanations are frankly not even plausible.   With regard to the first statement to which Justice Alito referred, the statement that was made at the scene approximately half an hour after initial -- officers initially responded to the scene.   The State's argument is that Boatner was somehow too traumatized to make an identification at the time.   But not only did Boatner not so testify at the post-conviction hearing -- in fact he testified that he couldn't recall the statement at all -- but the very officer who took the statement himself testified at trial in this case that at the time of the statement Boatner was, quote,   \"coherent and articulated very well the events that transpired. \"   And that is at pages 137 to 138 of the joint appendix. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " --That may be true, but if you were a juror and Boatner testified and he was cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based on his failure to make an identification right at the scene and he said, well, that was because five of my friends had just been killed and I was lying on the floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later when I collected myself and they asked me the same question at the police station I provided a description and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody, do you think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he couldn't identified him at the scene so he must have been lying when he identified -- when he provided a description later at the police station? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Justice Alito, I think that it's possible that a juror could credit that explanation in any retrial, though-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Wasn't there -- wasn't there an intervening -- didn't he say 5 days after that he couldn't identify?   And that was after what he said on the night, the same night.   5 days later he said: I couldn't -- I couldn't identify him. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.   But even if we didn't have the March 6th statement or statements, I would frankly be happy to take my chances with the jury, even with regard solely to the March 1st statement, in light of that testimony of Officer Ronquillo that Boatner was in fact coherent, articulated very well the events that transpired just like any witness, and so on and so forth.   So again-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counselor-- "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --we don't think that it's our burden to show that no juror could credit the State's explanation.   It's simply that we think that that explanation doesn't hold water. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Counselor, your argument now and in your brief suggests that you're relying most heavily on the failure to provide the impeachment materials of the only witness to this crime and the only piece of evidence that ties your client to the crime.   But you also mention other things, and Respondents spend 90 percent of their brief arguing against the other things.   But I just want to clarify those other things.   Number one, was the testimony mixed testimony about whether the assailants wore a mask across their face or over their entire head? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " There were-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What's the best take on what the evidence showed that was presented on that issue? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --There was some degree of variation in what the witnesses said.   Now, in the main we are talking again about statements that were withheld.   And I want to lay out those statements very briefly if I may.   There were two eyewitnesses who made statements to the police indicating that some or all of the perpetrators, including the first man through the door, were wearing masks.   Those were the statements of Shaelita Russel and the statement of Dale Mims.   Now, with regard to the statement of Shaelita Russell -- and this was what we believe was the dying declaration that she made at the scene in the immediate aftermath of having been shot multiple times -- Russell said she saw people barge into the kitchen, one had a black cloth across the face, first one through the door.   So it is at least theoretically possible-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could I ask you something?   Who determines that issue of whether that's a dying declaration?   Do we determine that in deciding whether the withholding of the Brady materials was harmful or not?   Do we give deference to the lower court's determination of that?   Do they have to decide whether it was a dying declaration.   What's the standard on something like this? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --The lower court did not make such a determination in this case on this or any of the other evidentiary issues that Respondent now advances, at least in part, because it does not appear that Respondent advanced any of those arguments below.   But I think more broadly, Justice Sotomayor, in terms of the role of this Court or any other court considering a Brady claim, this Court hasn't quite spoken to the specific issue of whether a Brady court is supposed to itself make an evidentiary determination where there is a question about admissibility, but the closest that this Court came was in Wood v. Bartholomew, in which this Court indicated that with regard to Brady material, it either has to itself be admissible or be reasonably likely to lead to admissible evidence.   And the Court's reasoning in Wood v. Bartholomew was somewhat spare on that score.   That was a summary reversal and a per curiam opinion.   But I do think that it would be appropriate for a Brady court to make that determination itself or at a minimum make a determination as to whether it appears that it's reasonably likely that the evidence would be admissible.   Here we really don't think that it's a close question, particularly with regard to the statement of Shaelita Russell, because the context of the handwritten notes makes clear that the statement was taken at the scene of the crime.   Shaelita Russell was taken to the hospital approximately a half an hour after the shootings occurred.   She told two witnesses that she believed that she was dying and so under the law on dying declarations -- and I have no reason to believe that the law is any different in Louisiana from the Federal system or the 49 other States -- that would comfortably satisfy that requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Now, Mr. Mims was the neighbor who saw the two -- there were three assailants in total, right, and two left the scene? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " There is some doubt as to whether or not there were three or four assailants.   And Mims himself, in all candor, was a little bit inconsistent on that point.   But he consistently said both in the handwritten notes and in his testimony at the post-conviction hearing that all of the assailants, however many there were, were wearing masks and that he saw them as they were getting into the car.   He didn't say anything further other than that the masks were ski-type masks.   But the State's argument with regard to the materiality of Mims's statement is that it is possible that the men would not have been wearing masks when they entered the house to allegedly commit the armed robbery and therefore the fact that Boatner saw the first man unmasked can be reconciled with his statement.   And again, we would be happy to take our chances with the jury and make the argument that that would be an exceedingly unconventional way to go about committing an armed robbery.   And again with regard to the Russell and Mims statements, I think it's important to remember that we view those statements as going directly to and contradicting Boatner's in-court identification.   And so in some sense we view those statements as being of a piece with Boatner's own prior statements in which he indicated that he could not identify anyone and that he would not-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Does the defense have any theory as to why Boatner would lie about whether he could identify this individual? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --First of all, Justice Alito, it would of course not be the defense's burden in any subsequent retrial to come up with a theory of its own.   The defense could simply argue, as it did at the first trial, that the prosecution simply didn't bear its burden on reasonable doubt. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yes, but -- but the impact of your impeachment evidence would be related certainly to if a juror would ask: Well, why would he lie about this?   And I'm -- I'm just asking, did the defense have any theory about what his motive would be about whether he could identify somebody, whether this first person had a mask or not. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " As this Court will be aware from its recent consideration of eyewitness evidence, it doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that an eyewitness identification is mistaken that the eyewitness was somehow lying about it.   It may very well have been that Boatner made a mistaken identification in good faith out of a desire to identify the person who killed several of his friends.   And indeed, as the amicus brief of the Innocence Project explains in this case, there is a phenomenon known as mug shot exposure effect, where an individual who sees a mug shot in some other context is more likely to identify that same person when confronted with a subsequent line-up.   Of course, where, as here, the individual is exposed to the mug shot for the first time in seeing a newspaper article that depicts the individual in question and suggests that that individual is a suspect in the crime, it would not at all be unusual for the individual when confronted with that photograph again in a line-up a few weeks later to pick that individual out. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But the first time he -- he said that the person wasn't masked and provided a description was long before he saw any mug shots.   It was the evening of the event.   It was when he was questioned at the police station. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, on the evening of the event he provided those limited details about the gold teeth and the low-cut haircut. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yes, but by doing that he's saying this person wasn't wearing a mask.   That's the critical point. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, that may suggest that the person was not wearing a mask.   Of course, it's possible that the person somehow had part of his face covered.   But I think it's important to realize, Justice Alito, that even with regard to that statement, while it is true that Boatner provided those limiting details, he also made statements suggesting that he was not confident of his ability to actually make an identification.   And in that statement, which is found at page 296 of the joint appendix, he says:   \"I was too scared to look at anybody. \"   \"I wish I could give y'all a description. \"   So in some sense we think that the focus on the gold teeth and the low-cut haircut in this case is a bit of an aside, because the question here is not whether he saw enough to support the subsequent identification.   The question is whether his suppressed statements in which he repeatedly said, I can't make an identification, contradict his in-court confident identification of Petitioner.   And we think that in order to decide this case, all that the Court essentially need say in an opinion is that in a case such as this one, in which all you have is the identification of a single eyewitness, where you have statements in which that eyewitness said, I can't make an identification, and those statements have concededly been suppressed, the Brady materiality threshold is satisfied. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Am I right that this-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " In looking at the appendix, there are some asterisks.   Were these statements, the first two -- the one at 252 in the joint appendix and then the statement on March 2nd, which is the one you just referred to, 296, were parts of those statements given to the defense counsel or none of the statements?   And how long were the documents?   Were they 20 or 30 pages?   Can you tell me a little bit about that? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " First of all, none of those statements were given to the defense.   The only relevant-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I shouldn't have said statements.   None of the reports. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --Yes.   None of the statements or the surrounding materials was given to the defense at all.   The only even remotely relevant thing that was given to the defense was the initial police report, which was a five-page document prepared by the officers who initially responded to the scene, with a one-page narrative of what took place.   And that document, for the Court's reference, is in volume 10 of the initial record that was received from the district court at pages R1907 to 1911.   Now, with regard to these specific statements, both the narrative statements and the handwritten notes, the narrative statements were contained in a relatively voluminous document, I believe it was an 83-page document, that was a narrative prepared by Officer Ronquillo that set out everything that took place over the course of the investigation.   And none of that was disclosed.   Respondent makes the argument that the trial court reviewed that document in camera, but we think that it is somewhat unclear what, if anything, the trial court actually reviewed in camera.   There is no dispute that that document was not handed over to the defense.   With regard to the handwritten notes, there actually are a relatively small number of relevant handwritten notes in this case, but all of them were contained in the police files and none of them, none of the ones at issue on which we are relying, was handed over before trial.   So this is not a case in which selective materials were handed over.   None of this material was handed over, and that's why we really think that this is a case that involves the categorical withholding of documents and not simply the withholding of selected documents that may subsequently turn out to be relevant. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Can you just tell me, how does Brady work?   Is there some obligation for the defense counsel to say: Please give me all relevant reports? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " No.   This Court has made clear that a request is unnecessary to trigger the Brady obligation, and this Court has made clear in cases dating back to Brady itself that the good faith or bad faith of the prosecutor is irrelevant.   And, of course, the prosecutor has a duty under Brady to hand over not only materials in the prosecutor's own possession, but also materials in the possession of the police as well. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Counsel, is -- this group or gang, all of them had gold teeth and faded hair cuts? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " There were five other suspects who had gold teeth or -- and low-cut hair cuts.   Three of the other individuals who were primarily in the frame for this murder had those characteristics.   I believe that the three were Banister, Phillips and Young.   The only other suspect who is a reasonably likely suspect who didn't was Robert Trackling, the suspect whose confession to involvement in these shootings was withheld. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " In short, faded hair cuts and gold teeth were not a unique characteristic. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " They were not uncommon in the 1990s. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What were these--   [Laughter]   They are uncommon to me.   These -- these were not gold teeth that were implanted, right?   Was it some kind of a mouthpiece of gold? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " I have to admit that my familiarity with this practice is perhaps not that much greater than yours, Justice Scalia.   But my understanding is-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I'm sorry to hear that. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --My understanding is that these are gold teeth that are worn either as temporary or perhaps semi-permanent implants, and that in hip-hop culture in the 1990s this was relatively common.   But whatever the provenance of this practice, it is undisputed on this record that multiple other suspects had those characteristics.   Justice Sotomayor, there was one thing you asked that I just want to get back to with regard to the remaining categories of evidence.   I just want to set them out and then I'd be happy to answer any questions that the Court has about them.   And if there are no further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.   As we explained in our brief, there are three other categories of evidence at issue here.   There was the statement of Phillip Young, Petitioner's co-defendant, suggesting that Petitioner was not involved in the shootings.   There were also the statements that would have called into question the prosecution's theory that Petitioner was one of the shooters, a theory that was essential to establishing the intent required for first degree murder under Louisiana law.   Louisiana is somewhat different from other States in that it doesn't require a premeditation, but that it -- but it does require a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, on that point, the State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a 9-millimeter automatic pistol. "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " Well, we don't think that that's a meaningless distinction, and we cite numerous sources in our brief that draw precisely that distinction.   But I think that what's noteworthy with regard to the statements at issue is that both Boatner, who identified the weapon that the perpetrator whom he believed to be the Petitioner was carrying, and the State's ballistics expert, Kenneth Leary, who identified the weapon that was responsible for the firing of the casings at issue, conspicuously failed to say that the weapon at issue was a 9-millimeter handgun.   But at trial their testimonies suddenly converged and Boatner, who had previously said only that the perpetrator was carrying a handgun, said that the perpetrator was carrying a 9-millimeter handgun; and Leary, who said that the casings at issue had come from a machine pistol of the Intratec or MAC-11 type, suddenly said that they came from a 9-millimeter handgun instead.   And so at a minimum, if the defense had possessed those statements, it could have sown doubt on whether the firearm was in fact one and the same and, therefore, sown doubt on a critical element of the offense at issue.   And finally, the only other category-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'd just like to go back to that because I'm not sure that I understand the argument.   Both the ballistics expert at trial said that the casings were consistent with a 9-millimeter, and I know that Boatner said that it was a 9-millimeter that was used, and the issue was whether anybody would call a MAC gun a handgun as opposed to an automatic pistol, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --Well, that's right with regard to Leary's testimony.   I think the thing that was a little bit odd with regard to Boatner's testimony was the sudden degree of specificity.   Having said only that it was a handgun or a chrome automatic in his prior statements, he said at trial that it was a 9-millimeter handgun, which he had not previously said in the statements that were withheld.   And, finally, the last category of evidence consists of the notes of the interview in which Eric Rogers relayed Robert Trackling's confession to involvement in the shootings.   As the amicus brief of the NACDL points out, courts have routinely held that confessions by other perpetrators constitute exculpatory evidence, even with regard to offenses that may have had multiple perpetrators.   And we certainly believe that at a minimum the suppression of those notes, when considered in conjunction with all the other evidence, comfortably satisfies the Brady materiality standard, and it's for that reason that we think that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed.

And yes, Justice Sotomayor, several of the -- of those faces or several of those individuals bore short fade haircuts.   And yes, some of the individuals who were pictured in those photo line-ups were other suspects.   The record reflects that Mr. Boatner scrutinized those 72 faces.

When the trial judge learned -- that the photograph had been shown in the newspaper, he reopened the hearing on the motion to suppress to determine -- and over the State's objection; we argued that this was not State action -- but he reopened the motion to suppress to determine for himself whether or not that newspaper had in any way tainted the later identification of Juan Smith. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What is this?   I mean, I thought -- I may -- I thought the issue is that there were some notes, and the first note, which was made on the day, the policeman says that Boatner said he could not supply a description of the perpetrator, other than to say they were black males.   Then he said they had golden teeth and low-cut haircuts.   And 5 days later he could not ID anyone because he couldn't see faces.   Then he said he'd only glanced at the first man.   He couldn't tell if they had their faces covered and didn't see anyone.   Then he said: I could not ID, would not know them if I saw them.   Then another set of police notes says he said that he could not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder.   So I guess those are all notes that the -- the prosecution did not give to the defense.   So if you were a defense lawyer, whatever this other stuff is, I guess you would have been pretty happy to have those notes, because you might have tried to impeach his identification.

To a first responding officer who was not Detective Ronquillo, he gave a description and that description was: Heavy built, with a hair with a fade, with a little small top, with a lot of gold in his mouth.   That was while he was at the scene.   Later, homicide Detective John Ronquillo arrived at the scene and apparently, according to his notes, and, most importantly, according to his post-conviction, testimony, he asked Larry -- he asked Larry Boatner for a description, and Larry Boatner said: I can't give you a description.   I'll put them all in perspective and then go back to what Detective Ronquillo and Mr. Boatner had to say about that.   But in any case, Mr. Boatner's severe laceration was treated and then he was escorted to the homicide office, where he gave his formal statement.   And in that statement -- statement, part of which has been reproduced here by opposing counsel, Mr. Boatner said: I can tell you about the one, the one who put the pistol in my face.   He was a black male with a low cut, gold in his mouth.   I don't know how many; that's all; I was too scared to look at anybody.

Just three very quick points.   First of all with regard to Larry Boatner's statements on March the 6th, Justice Breyer, you'll be happy to note that your law clerk's notes were correct.   Boatner on March the 6th said, and this is at page 308 of the joint appendix, could not ID anyone because couldn't see faces; can't tell if had faces covered; didn't see anyone; would not know them if I saw them. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm not surprised they are correct.   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " It is quite clear that that statement applies to all of the perpetrators.   The State advances the argument today, as it did in its brief, that Boatner must have been too scared to cooperate by March the 6th, but that is utterly belied by the record in this case.   Boatner continued to cooperate with the police investigation in the following weeks reviewing police line-ups.   He even testified that he wanted to go looking for Petitioner after seeing his photograph in the New Orleans newspaper, pages 489 and 494 of the joint appendix.   He didn't leave New Orleans until June, 3 months later, and he actually returned to New Orleans before Petitioner was even apprehended, so again-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It is your understanding that the -- that all of Boatner's, all the notes about Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge before trial for in camera inspection? "}, {"speaker": "Kannon K. Shanmugam", "text": " --Justice Alito, it is entirely unclear based on this record.   Counsel for Respondent cites the transcript from October 31st, 1995, a transcript that wasn't even prepared until after cert was granted in this case.   It's clear that the court reviewed something, but it is entirely unclear from that transcript what the court reviewed; and of course, even if the court had made an in camera determination it would no way -- in no way affect our claim after the fact here.   My second point: The State today for the first time says in response to the question from Justice Scalia that there was more evidence here linking Petitioner to the crime and relies on the testimony of Eddie Young, the brother of Phillip Young, the individual who was found at the scene.   But the sole substance of that testimony was that Phillip Young knew Petitioner, and we would respectfully submit that that is scarcely inculpatory, and if it was, anyone in New Orleans who knows a felon ought to be worried; and therefore we really don't think that that adds anything to the evidence in this case.   The sole evidence linking Petitioner to the crime was the statement -- the testimony of Larry Boatner.   Third, there has been some discussion about the language in this Court's cases in Kyles and Agurs suggesting that prosecutors should err on the side of caution.   That is part of the constitutional standard because after all, the materiality requirement is part of the requirement for a constitutional violation under Brady.   But all of the evidence at issue here including Boatner's statements was withheld from the defense, leaving aside this question of what the trial court may have reviewed in camera.   And the prosecutor's conduct in this case, with all due respect to Ms. Andrieu, was not, quote,   \"a little too close to the wind. \"   The Orleans Parish district attorney's office acted with flagrant disregard for its obligations under Brady in this case.   The Brady standard has been around for half a century.   There is no real ambiguity about what that standard requires, and we think that the conduct in this case was in fact egregious and clearly violated that standard.   We think that the trial court erred by rejecting Petitioner's Brady claim and for that reason we think that its judgment should be reversed.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
