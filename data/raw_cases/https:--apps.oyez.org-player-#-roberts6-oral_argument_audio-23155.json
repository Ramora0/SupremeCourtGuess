[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear case next in Case 10-1001, Martinez v. Ryan.   Mr. Bartels. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   In Arizona almost all State and Federal claims for relief from a criminal conviction are raisable in the Arizona Court of Appeals on direct appeal.   However, a claim that trial counsel was ineffective must be presented first to a trial court in what Arizona labels a post-conviction relief proceeding.   Petitioner agrees entirely with Arizona's requirement that ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims go initially to a trial court, and he does not object to the label \"post-conviction relief\" as such.   The issue in the case has to do with Arizona's insistence that Petitioner had no right to counsel with respect to the post-conviction first-tier review, portion of first-tier review, even though he did have a right to counsel in the appeal portion of direct review.   And our position is that that distinction between what are two portions of the first opportunity for review of a conviction, broken up sensibly but by dictate of the State into two parts, that that distinction cannot stand, especially in a case in which the first post-conviction proceeding started and ended before anything of substance happened in this-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " If your main position is right, then wouldn't the same go for 2255 proceedings?   I mean, this Court has said it makes sense to have the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel looked at by a trial judge first, not an appellate judge, and yet in 2255 proceedings, if you are urging ineffective assistance of counsel, you don't get an automatic right to counsel.   In 2255 proceedings, counsel will be appointed only if the court determines that the interests of justice so require.   So the proposition you are urging would have ramifications in the Federal system as well, wouldn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --That's correct, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And so 2255 would no longer be the interests of justice so require because if it's your first opportunity to raise the point the court must appoint counsel for you.   Is that your view? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " In a situation -- The Federal system is a little more complicated than Arizona, but not much, because of Massaro.

"}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, with the caveat, if the State allows that kind of proceeding.   One of the things I have a hard time keeping track of in this context is, unlike the right to counsel at trial, the Sixth Amendment right, where I think they have to give him a trial, we are dealing in a context where this Court made clear well over 100 years ago that there doesn't have to be any review at all.   The State-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " That's a very far-reaching proposition that extends well beyond claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, wouldn't it?

Bartels", "text": " Your Honor, as I understand the situation, we've got newly discovered evidence of perhaps a Brady violation.

"}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Well, but the Federal system itself has a statute of limitation, though I believe that the statute would probably begin to run, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, with the discovery of a Brady violation.   So the Federal courts have set up the statute of limitations to accommodate that point.   And the States would be free to do that, too, if they wish. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " If you permitted this counsel to raise a claim that could not have been raised on the direct appeal, is the counsel limited to that point, or can the counsel representing the client bring up other things? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " No, Your Honor.   The right to counsel would apply only to the first-tier review issue.   And so, for example, if counsel finds other issues and wants to pursue them, the State could say: We're not going to pay you for those.

It wouldn't be limited to ineffective assistance of counsel? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D.

What if the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is closely related to other claims that Petitioner wants to raise in an initial post-conviction relief proceeding?   Counsel at trial was ineffective for failing to do A, B, C and D, and all of those are bases for relief.   And now I want to argue with new counsel in the first post-conviction proceeding not only that counsel was ineffective at trial, but also that all these other claims are meritorious.   Are you saying that the counsel to whom the Petitioner has a right is limited to making only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and cannot go on and represent the Petitioner on these other claims? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " I'm saying, Your Honor, that the State does not have any duty to pay the lawyer in those circumstances.   Now, the kind of situation you are talking about I think is most likely to come up where-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It's not a question of pay.   I think Justice Alito was asking, counsel says: I've got a duty to represent my client zealously, so I want to bring up not only ineffective assistance of counsel, but these other matters.

I don't understand how that works.   The claim is, say for example, you were ineffective because you didn't raise a Batson claim.   Surely he gets to review the Batson claim once he establishes the effectiveness-- "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, and in fact in that example pursuing the ineffective assistance claim requires pursuing the Batson claim. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --So the lawyer -- the State would be required to provide counsel not simply to raise the threshold ineffectiveness argument, but to go ahead and raise the arguments as to which he was ineffective. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Well, Your Honor, in the situation in which the ineffectiveness of counsel is based on the failure to make a Batson claim, the failure to make an objection at trial, I would agree with you, absolutely.   In my experience-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What about other claims that don't follow on?   I mean, other claimed errors in the trial?   You say the State doesn't have to pay for that representation.   Does counsel keep time sheets on-- "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor.

It happens routinely in the State system.   The appointed counsel have to submit detailed billing statements. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How does this work now, counsel?   How are you proposing this work?   Right now in the Federal system a pro se litigant comes in and says: I have an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.   Most district courts say, ask the attorney to submit an affidavit, and then decides whether on the face of the claims there is reason to appoint counsel and hold a hearing.   Under your theory, every State would be obligated to appoint counsel ab initio to check out whether there is the potential for an <IAC> [= IAC] claim? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Well, I think the States could run this in different ways.   The way in which Arizona does it makes sense to me, which is that the -- there is a form, Form 24-B.   It's a very simple form.   It doesn't require stating any substantive grounds.   It really just says: I would like to challenge my conviction through post-conviction relief, in the very same way that notices of appeal-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what you are essentially saying, every State is obligated to appoint an attorney on the first leg?

"}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, I -- I guess I would say two things about that.   One, there are a fair number of States that do appoint counsel routinely on request.   Arizona is one.

Could you answer the original question that Justice Sotomayor asked?   She said: What happens in Arizona?   You said a prisoner, or defendant, he has been convicted, gone through his first round of appeal.   He is given a form, which you said was a simple form, do you want to proceed in collateral review?   And he answers yes.   Then does Arizona appoint a lawyer or not? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   Then what are we arguing about?   He had his lawyer. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " He didn't have an effective lawyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Ah, so now you are talking about the second round.   You are talking about does he have a right to a lawyer when he wants to claim that the first lawyer that they gave him on collateral review was ineffective? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " No, Your Honor, that is not the issue in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What is the issue? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " The issue in this case is whether the ineffectiveness of the first post-conviction counsel constitutes cause to excuse the-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   So why -- that's what I thought, actually; and I don't understand what all the briefs are about, and I must be missing something, about whether they are all going to have to appoint lawyers or not in these different States.   It seems to me that has nothing to do with this case.   This case comes out of a State that does appoint lawyers and the question is whether you, your client, should have from your point of view at least one full, effective chance to say, every lawyer I have been appointed, I've gotten 100 and they are all terrible, and -- or whether the State can block that from being heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19 and the claim that all 19 were ineffective, he can't even raise.   That's the issue, is that it? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, we are actually, once we take it past two, I -- I'm not on board with the hypothetical. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, no, no -- but I'm not -- I'm not ridiculing as it sounded your claim.   I'm saying maybe that's right.   Maybe he's not going to win the claim, probably; but the question is, if his claim is in Federal habeas, I have gotten 102 lawyers in 102 proceedings and every one of them was absolutely ineffective, perhaps that habeas judge has to look at it and say oh, I see, he's claiming he never had one full effective chance to claim that his trial lawyer was ineffective because the other 19 was just as bad -- I have to look at it if I'm a trial judge.   Now, that is not a silly argument in my opinion; that could be a winning argument.   I just want to know is that basically your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " No, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " That is not my argument. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now let's start at ground zero, sorry.   Everyone else--   [Laughter] "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why isn't that where your argument leads, to the proposition that you can never procedurally default irrevocably an ineffective assistance of counsel claim? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Well, Your Honor, on a theoretical level, I don't think this Court's decisions in Douglas and Ross and Halbert give us a clear answer about whether there's a right to effective assistance of second post-conviction counsel-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But we want to know what rule you are advocating in this case. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --I-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " We want to know why you are not advocating for what Justice Breyer and Justice Alito indicate is an endless right to claim that all previous counsel were ineffective.   You say oh, no, you are not arguing that.   What is the rule that you are arguing for?   What limiting principle do you have so that we do not have an endless right of counsel? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, the -- the theory that you get counsel for first-tier review limits it to that first tier, because when you go after the effectiveness of the -- of the first post-conviction counsel, that is necessarily going to involve review of the effectiveness of trial counsel. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But -- I understand that.   But what is it that prevents the Petitioner from saying that the first counsel in the collateral proceeding was ineffective and that so was the second? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Your Honor, I don't think there is a right to a counsel and therefore not a right to effective counsel in the second-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But you can -- you can have a -- you don't have to give him a counsel.   Look, the State did give him a counsel on first collateral review; that counsel was supposed to, according to him, raise the claim, my trial counsel was no good.   Now we go to the next round.   The State says: I'm sorry, you are on your own here; we are not giving you a lawyer anymore.   Okay.   That may count.   He now has to know he has to make the argument himself.   And therefore he goes and makes the argument himself, and now he's in habeas and he can argue they got it all wrong.   He's not blocked. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   So what -- there isn't an issue in this case about giving people counsel, on that view.   There is an issue about if you do give them counsel, then they have to be able to have an argument later that you did it ineffectively.   That's a different matter; that's a question of whether you are blocked in habeas and can't even make the claim.   All right, forget it.   I will ask the other. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I think I'm on the same page with that example. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah, okay. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But there can't be a claim-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Can I leave this argument with the judgment that you have offered me no limiting principle on how many proceedings there must be-- "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " --before there's an end to the argument that previous counsel were inadequate?   I understand, this is the -- in this case it was the first counsel in -- in the first collateral proceeding that we are talking about.   But why couldn't it be the second?   You don't give us a limiting principle. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Well, Your Honor-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And if you want to say there shouldn't be, then that's fine. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --No, Your Honor, there shouldn't.   And the merits -- the Petitioner's merits brief devoted quite a few pages to both the theoretical problems with the infinite continuing of litigation and the practical limitations.   And let me -- let me turn to the practical ones. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So Mr. Bartels, before you do that, I mean, I understood you to be saying that you would draw a line after the first post-conviction proceeding; is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Yes, that's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And the briefs go back and forth as to whether that line -- you know, what lies behind that line.   But you would draw the line there? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, theoretically.   And the State has the wherewithal, given McKane, to draw the line anywhere it pleases.   It could just say you get one post-conviction. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " --What I understand you to be saying is exactly that.   A line has to be drawn somewhere; enough is enough; it can't go on forever. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And the sensible place to draw the line in your view is after the first-tier review; that's your argument, right? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, because I-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " The problem with that is you can answer that by saying: Yes, we have to draw a line someplace and the Court has already done that, and it did it in Douglas and it was after first tier of review on direct appeal.   It's exactly the same argument, except where the law stands now the line is drawn at a different place on the same principle.   It has to be drawn someplace. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, that principle doesn't work very well in a system like Arizona's where you can't bring this one claim on the direct appeal, and you can -- and Mr. Martinez, well, couldn't -- you can file your first post-conviction and litigate it while the appeal is pending before it's final. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So you would be happy with a system that said, no, you don't have to raise it in collateral review, you have to raise it on direct appeal, which is very unworkable, because if you are arguing ineffective assistance of counsel in a direct proceeding, presumably it's usually the same counsel; he's not likely to bring the claim.   That would be worse for criminal defendants than the system-- "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Well-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --that's there now. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --No, Your Honor.   The -- if direct appeal is now going to encompass possible claims of ineffective assistance, you are not going to be able to have the same counsel on appeal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but the person who decides what arguments you are going to make on appeal is usually the person who handled the trial in these types of cases. "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Well, Your Honor, that's not true in Arizona. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " In Arizona, the usual case in criminal cases is that somebody else handles the appeal on direct proceedings? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " It may be from the same office.   But I agree that that would have to change if ineffective assistance of counsel were part of the direct appeal.   And the other thing that would have to be done -- and this is done in some States -- is that you have to raise it in direct appeal, but most -- as this Court recognized in Massaro -- most ineffective assistance claims cannot be dealt with on direct appeal because of a lack of evidence.   They need more evidence. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel certainly can't be dealt with on direct appeal; right? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " No, that's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So even if you get a different counsel to -- to take the appeal, you could always claim that that counsel was ineffective in habeas, right? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Your Honor, I -- two things about that.   First of all, the State does not have to provide the review of the effectiveness of appellate counsel.   If it does so, I would still say that that's going to end up having to be second opportunity review of the claims that appellate counsel failed to raise.   That's got to be the basis for-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If there is a right to counsel whenever someone asserts a claim that couldn't have been raised earlier, why does the State not have the obligation to provide counsel to contest the constitutionality of the representation that was provided on appeal? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, the -- the reason is that -- in terms of this first tier, second tier analysis from Douglas and Halbert, you are not going to be able to look at the effectiveness of appellate counsel without looking at the issue of prejudice.   And that's going to require what is second opportunity review of the merits of the claim that the appellate lawyer didn't raise.   But that's the second opportunity for that review, because the direct appeal was the first opportunity.   I think in the end, though, just a Mathews v. Eldridge procedural due process analysis works better.   And the critical factor is what's the risk of an error in the absence of counsel?   Well, the first time around, the risk of your -- involves the probability that the trial judge made a mistake that's prejudicial.   By the time we get to the post-conviction challenging appellate counsel's effectiveness, now it's the probability that the trial judge was wrong and that the appellate lawyer was wrong.   And so it's exponentially lower -- that at least provides a basis for-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " A trial judge doesn't have to be wrong for there to be ineffective assistance of counsel claim at trial? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --No.   No.   I'm sticking with the example of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.   Trial counsel -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I was wondering what you would say -- some of these statistics is just that these claims succeed very, very rarely.   So by the analysis that you just used, this kind of balancing analysis, why we should even go so far as you would have us go? "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " Well, Your Honor, it would be because Douglas and Halbert have done that balancing in saying that in this situation, the first tier review, the probability of an incorrect result without counsel is sufficiently high that there should be counsel.   And that's really the disagreement between Justice Douglas and Justice Harlan in Douglas.   Justice Harlan didn't think the lawyers mattered-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So the -- post-conviction application would go to the trial judge; right?   And on the-- "}, {"speaker": "Robert D. Bartels", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor.

It seems to me you -- there was enslavement -- ineffective assistance of counsel, and you should raise that.   That's a viable issue, so I'm not going to accept your briefs.

Cattani", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   I would like to focus on three points.   First, petitioner is advocating a significant change to this Court's jurisprudence that does implicate the State's reliance interest on Finley and Giarratano.   It's not a minor change-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Cattani, can I ask about your interests here, because your State is one that does appoint counsel.   So you already have the costs there.   I'm just wondering, in your brief, you talk a lot about the excessive costs that this would impose on you.

Under the theory and -- I don't think there's really been advanced a principled basis for limiting the rule that's been advanced, and certainly-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, if we just said there is, you know, we can only draw a line in this context and we're going to draw the line here, and this is where it sticks.

And after that, the Arizona courts thought, no, he was adequate at trial.   This particular defendant wants to say that that lawyer was inadequate, too.   In fact, it was the same one.   Hardly surprising.   That's his view.

Is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Kent E. Cattani", "text": " Well, I think it's better viewed through the lens of procedural due process.   We are looking at what are the procedures that are available to a defendant to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

It could be accomplished without appointing counsel, certainly having somebody-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Don't guess where I'm going here.   Maybe nobody wants to go there.   Just follow the questions.   The question is, if he tries to make the claim he does, want to say that my first lawyer was no good at trial, and my second lawyer, who by coincidence was the same in the collateral proceeding, was no good either, then the State comes in and says: You can't make that argument now because we had a proceeding called the collateral review proceeding; we didn't have to give you a lawyer there.

This Court has never -- has never said that every claim that can only be raised for the first time entitles someone to -- to counsel.

In Arizona, in most States where the types of claims that can be raised in post-conviction proceedings are generally limited to claims that could not have been raised earlier.

We live in a world that is settled and working.

Wall", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, I understand, but I think this is an area where States are permitted to draw different lines, and what Petitioner is saying -- take the Federal system, for example.   Petitioner's rule would say a Federal prisoner can walk in under 2255 and by making an allegation of ineffectiveness, of either trial or appellate counsel, he is entitled to appointed counsel, without even I take it a showing of colorableness.

I think it's very difficult to explain why his rule doesn't require him to go further, because by saying the first tier is not a stage of a case, as this Court has always meant it, but it applies claim by claim, and lawyers are going to represent you only on some claims, and you're -- pro se you will file others -- he ends up with two problems.   One, he has to concede as he does in his reply brief and as he did in response to Justice Alito, that he is going to say the same thing with regard to a lot of other claims that are typically raised in habeas; and second, he can't find a limiting principle.   Because when you come in your second or your third or your post-fourth conviction proceeding, and you say all my previous counsel has been ineffective, that is also the first time that you have been able to say it; and you will be making the same claim: I am entitled to have one constitutionally competent lawyer argue that my trial counsel is ineffective.

It's as if you couldn't bring up the claim that the judge was sleeping until he got the collateral proceedings.   A State could have such a rule -- I don't know why they would, but they could.

Discretionary appeal, we said the likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal because they would have a record from below, they would have competent counsel below who would make the best arguments possible, they could then pursue their discretionary appeals because they had something to work with.

Here, the Court said in Massaro these claims are best suited to resolution in habeas, and they are claims that are traditionally brought in habeas.   And at least for that type of claim, which is the -- I mean, the State's not trying to hide the ball here.   All the State has done was take a claim that this Court has said belongs in habeas and say we are putting it in habeas, not in a Federal system where although people can raise it as a practical matter, they're all decided on collateral review -- virtually all of them.   It says, we are just going to say people have trouble briefing and raising it and we will relocate it to collateral review, not for ambiguous or arbitrary reasons but for all of the reasons that this Court gave in Massaro.   So at least for that type of claim, I think it's permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment leaving for another day whether they could do it with other types of claims -- that I do think probably belong to a direct appeal.   And that would present very different constitutional problems if a State started trying to channel them to collateral review, but -- all Arizona has done is pick up on Massaro and say absolutely right, these claims belong in habeas, and that's where we are going to put them.

Wall", "text": " --Justice Sotomayor, a number of States have found under their own constitution or statutes a right to effective assistance of counsel.   But it's a very different matter to say that when States go beyond what the Constitution requires in providing counsel, that counsel's performance thereby gives rise to a due process claim.   And again, the courts rejected that in at least three cases, and I think saying that it's cause to excuse a procedural default here without saying that there is some underlying right to counsel would require a ruling in those other cases.

Bartels", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, let me straighten out one thing -- subtly in the record about the facts.   This is not in the record, and I am doing this for my friend's benefit.   Harriet Levitt was initially appointed to represent Mr. Martinez on appeal.   She then moved to have herself appointed for purposes of a post-conviction review, and it was at a later date, not too much later, that she filed the notice.   So at the time the notice was filed, she was officially appointed counsel for purposes of post-conviction proceedings, and the Arizona Court of Appeals stayed their proceedings, which were ongoing.   There was a notice of appeal to allow it to continue.   The other point that I wanted to get to was, the questions about other States where this -- these claims are handled on direct appeal illustrate a couple of things about our argument: One is, it would be -- seem very peculiar to say you have a right to appointed and effective counsel in Wisconsin or Utah on these issues, but not in Arizona, where the label -- that difference is purely label.   All these claims, almost all of them, require additional evidence, and that fact makes counsel even more important.   Respondents want to say you have a right to counsel on review for almost all claims, but not the one where you need it the most. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
