[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 139972, Rodriguez v. The United States.   Mr. O'Connor. "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The big issue that starts in this case is whether, after completing the task related to a traffic stop, whether an officer without individualized suspicion can hold the driver for a dog sniff.   The specific question in this case is whether Officer Struble was entitled to piggyback an already completed traffic offense with probable cause on to that piggyback -- on to that traffic offense for an investigation of Mr. Rodriguez involving nothing more than a hunch.   That is the question of the case. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But that remains -- that wasn't reached by the court of appeals.   The district -- the district court, as you pointed out, rejected the argument that there was probable cause saying if nothing more than a hunch.   But that was not reviewed by the court of appeals.   So that would still be open. "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " The -- the decision of the court of appeals, Your Honor, absolutely, that was a de minimis ruling.   They did not reach the question as to whether there was reasonable suspicion, and left it just based on their ruling of -- of whether, in fact, this was a de minimis action. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

In other words, let's say, there were, you know, two -- two policemen there already.   One says, I'm going to go write you a ticket and while that's taking place, the other policeman walks around with the dog.   No problem with that? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P.

All of that has nothing to do with the broken taillight and yet, that's permitted, right? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " --Yes.   Yeah.

In Justice Scalia's hypothetical, the officer said, I'm not going to give you a ticket, but I just want to ask you a few questions.   It seems to me that under your argument, those questions are impermissible because he's made his decision, he's not going to give a ticket.   On the other hand, as Justice Alito indicated, suppose that he said, now, I finished your ticket, but before I give it to you, I'm going to go back to the police car and check to see if there are warrants, is that all right?

When you finish those, that's when the stop ends. "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, that is exactly right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yes, but you've tied it to just writing it handing over the ticket, but or you're not even doing that, you're -- you're saying just writing the ticket, which is crazy.

It's not -- the formal handing of the ticket is when the stop is complete.   Once the justification for the stop and the purpose is complete, the ticket is done, whether it is a warning, whether it is handed to them, at some point in time the ticket is done and that's the investigation of the stop. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Justice Sotomayor's question assumes, and you apparently embrace the assumption, that checking on whether you have a private -- a proper license, checking whether the car is stolen, all of these things are embraced within the mission when the only basis for the stop is you have a broken taillight.   How does that have anything to do with the broken taillight? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P.

Before completion of-- "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " Before the completion of the mission.

O'Connor", "text": " Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Part of the mission where you stop somebody is not just the broken taillight, but, you know, whether the car is stolen, whether you have drugs on the car, so let's bring in a dog and do the car sniff.   I mean, you're willing to expand the mission to everything up to but not beyond the dog sniff.   Why do you do that? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " --You expand the mission, Your Honor, for everything that comes within the tasks that are part of the traffic stop.   The dog sniff-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It's a broken taillight.   That's the only thing that comes within the traffic stop.   All the rest is added on.   And you let them add it on.   Why do you let them add on the dog sniff?   You do so long as it occurs before the ticket is delivered; is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P.

You're really, I think, much better off if you stick with the formal rule.   Once you hand the ticket, that's the end of it.   Then you have a formal rule.   You're not arguing that, and that leaves us open to the question of why can't we include the dog sniff. "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P.

It just seems that you're not going to accomplish any protection for individuals if that's your position, that -- that it was just a question of when you do it.   So if you do it during the stop, before the ticket issued, it's okay and if you do it two minutes after, it's not okay. "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P.

However, before I give it to you, I want to have a dog sniff, I'm going to call in to headquarters.   They're going to send out a dog.   It's going to take maybe 45 minutes.   You just sit there because the traffic stop is not -- is not terminated until I give you your ticket.   You're going to allow that? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P.

Handing of the ticket is not the end-all.   Handing of the ticket is when the tasks are done.   I got pulled over for a driving offense, then it -- it -- then it is over.   In your example, Mr. Chief Justice, if he's pondering, then he's not being diligent.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What about the registration is pertinent to the traffic stop? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " Well, what's pertinent about it is, part of the traffic stop is the vehicle itself as well.   Not only do you have the driver, but you're looking at the driver, the driver's history, the car.   All of those things are part and parcel to the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

I think that is part of investigating the -- the -- traffic offense.   Those are things that have been accepted -- and \u201c accepted \u201d might -- might -- might not be the right word -- adopted as things that you can do in a traffic stop.   Now, there are certainly times when you go beyond the traffic stop.   And you have the Johnson case.   If, in fact, you go beyond the -- the -- the traffic stop even measurably beyond it, then you have violated the -- the -- the driver's rights, and it is unconstitutional.   The question in that case occurred during the traffic stop. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. O'Connor, is this particular traffic violation, was that an arrestable offense?

And regardless, I mean, he was -- see, here's the -- here's the -- what we do know about this case: Not only do we know the mission is done because of the tasks that were completed, you have the officer that says, I've done the tasks, everything that needs to be done with this offense or with this -- with this traffic stop is finished.   It's finished.   There's no question about that.   Then there's no more justification.   In order for the driver to be continued to be detained, there must be new justification or consent, which you did not get in this case; but you must let the driver go because you are acting in, you are finished with the traffic stop, you are finished with the reason that he was detained in the first place, the purpose: Going across the fog line.

Basically what you do is the officer sees the infraction; the officer pulls the person over; the officer tells the person what the infraction is; he does the license; he does the registration, runs the car.   Then when it's done, he gives him the ticket, the warning ticket.   That is the end of the traffic stop.   There's no other reason to hold the person after that point in time.

I mean, I could understand the rule, you pull somebody over for a broken taillight, maybe you get the registration to make sure you write out the ticket to the right person.   Then you give him the ticket, and that's it.   No -- no time for the records check.   What does the records check have to do with pulling somebody over for a broken taillight?   I can understand that, but is that your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " Well, if that is -- that is part of what the courts have accepted as part of the stop.   You are looking at the vehicle itself.   Now, the dog, Your Honor, is different.

As the question he has suggested, it's unrelated to the traffic stop.   You're looking to see if this person has a record, committed other crimes, for example.   What has that got to do with whatever the traffic-- "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " --No. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --infraction is?   Not stopping at a stop sign, what has checking to see if the defendant has a criminal record got to do with that? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " That is something that the -- that the courts are looking at as to whether that is something that you should be able to do.   The courts have generally accepted that.   What I can come back, and in this particular case is not something that happened in this case, because it is clearcut.   Now, that issue is extremely important, but is something that I don't think can be done today. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " He can -- I mean, one reason I think they do the records check, the officer needs to know who he's dealing with.   I think one of the higher incidences of when officers are shot or wounded is when they make a traffic stop.   So if you run the registration, you see it's a stolen car, you need to know that before you go back and deal with the driver and other occupants.   What if the police officer determines that he's -- he's concerned about that, either as a general matter or as a specific matter.   He takes the license and registration, but he's not going to go back to the car until he has backup.   Okay?   So he calls ahead and said, I would -- you know, I would like backup.   And the person says, you know, it's going to take 25 minutes, and he says, fine.   Is that a legitimate reason?   The traffic stop isn't over, because he's -- he doesn't want to go back because he's alone and he doesn't know who these guys are. "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " That is a legitimate reason. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So he can call back.   Now -- now, okay, what if the backup is a canine unit?   The canine unit gets there, you've told us it hasn't been prolonged, and as the officer goes up to give him the warning the dog walks around the car.   Is that all right? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P.

Caballes definitely agrees with you on that a dog sniff is not part of the traffic stop.   So I think that you and Caballes are definitely in the same place there.   And Caballes definitely says that even though a dog sniff is not part of the mission of the traffic stop, we're going to allow a dog sniff if the dog sniff doesn't extend the traffic stop.   It's like, you know, there are two officers or there's some other reason why you're not being detained a moment longer because of the dog sniff and Caballes basically says, sure, no harm, no foul on that one, right?   But then you're saying Caballes gives you this extra leeway to detain people even though it is longer than an ordinary traffic stop would take, and I think that's just not right.   I mean, I think that reasonableness language in Caballes is all about -- it's an extra limitation the Court says.   It says, like, don't think just because this officer was really slow and it took a really long time to do the traffic stop, and he was able because of that to get another officer in and do a dog sniff and it was all with -- it's like an additional limitation that, no, you have to be diligent and you have to be reasonable in the way you conduct the traffic stop.   And if you're not, the dog sniff can't come in even though it was conducted during the time the traffic stop occurred.   But it -- that's -- that's an additional constraint.   It's not some kind of extra leeway for the police officers to do things outside the bounds of the traffic stop itself. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Well, I think that's one way to read Caballes's language.   The reason we don't think that that's the right way is that we know after Caballes that a dog sniff is not an independent Fourth Amendment intrusion.   It's not a search.   We also know that it doesn't impose it doesn't violate any independent scope limitation on traffic stops. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It is not a search, but the -- but the theory of Caballes and of all of our questions is that you can't -- and of all of our cases -- is that you really can't detain somebody if you don't have some kind of objective reasonable basis for doing so.   And that any detention -- and, you know, it might be ten minutes or it might be five minutes or it might be two minutes -- without that kind of basis is a Fourth Amendment violation. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " But once the individual is already being detained for a traffic stop on probable cause, I think the implication of Caballes is that -- that if the dog sniff takes any time, then the intrusion we're talking about is the incremental delay.

And so from the individual's perspective, her interest in -- it's the same in avoiding the dog sniff as it is in avoiding a warrant check or any other incident of a stop.   It's the interest against unreasonable delay.   And so because that's the case, we think the delays attributable to a dog sniff should be treated like delays attributable to a warrant check or anything else.   They should be subject to-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You say -- you've said several times the phrase \u201c incremental \u201d.

So doesn't the dog sniff have to be less than the traffic stop? "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " --I think that -- I think that one of the things that courts should look to is the relative proportion of time of the dog sniff to the rest of the stop.   And I -- the reason I think that is relevant is that the officer -- this is the case in routine traffic stops as well -- the officer has to be reasonably diligent.   And so, I think reasonably diligent can take into account whether the officer is predominantly working on resolving the traffic violation.   But if he is able to a dog sniff within a reasonable amount of time and not have the traffic stop exceed the duration of a reasonable, routine traffic stop, then he ought to be able to do that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Is that almost always the case, that the dog sniff is going to take longer than the traffic stop?   I mean, I would assume so.   The officer says license and registration, goes back, checks, comes back and gives you the ticket.   The dog sniff is something else altogether.   Assuming the dog is there, they've got to get -- you know, walk around the car.   If you're -- if it really has to be incremental, I'm not sure -- it's hardly ever going to be reasonable.

I mean, there are situations in cases -- we cited this in Footnote 20 of our brief where you have the dog arriving just as the officer is about to give the ticket.   So that is a scenario -- that that can occur.   And I do think there are several reasons why an officer may want to give the ticket first and then do the dog sniff immediately.   And one of them is officer safety.   I think everything that an officer does during a traffic stop, how he orders his tasks and how he performs them, is infused with officer safety considerations.

Yeah, you can.   But remember, once it's over, the traffic stop, it's over, done, finished.   And by the way, if it isn't over yet, you still well may get into trouble if you've unreasonably prolonged the stop just to get the sniff.   Now, that seems pretty easy to explain.   It's fairly brightline.   And as soon as you get into this other -- you know, just leaving it totally open, there's no check, really, on the -- on the or not too much of one.

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, he said-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Suppose, Ms. Anders, that -- it's a hypothetical -- police pulls somebody over and starts the process and then the police officer says, you know, I'd like a cigarette break now?   A cigarette probably takes about as long as the dog sniff took in this -- and just, you know, smokes a cigarette and he goes back to work.   All right?   Would you say that that was unconstitutional prolongation of the stop. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Well, an officer always has to be reasonably diligent.   So at a certain point if the officer takes breaks for no valid law enforcement reason, that is going to be dilatory and so the stop would become unreasonable. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " But, so I-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So it would become unreasonable because there he was, he wasn't doing anything related to the mission of the stop.   That's true if he gave the ticket and then said, I want you to stay while I take a cigarette break, or it's true if he did it before he gave the ticket, either way.   I guess what I'm saying to you is I kind of think it's the same thing, is that once you've acknowledge that the dog sniff is something that's extraneous to the stop itself -- it's obviously more helpful to the police than a cigarette break -- but it's extraneous to the stop itself -- then the same rules apply as if the police officer had just taken a moratorium on the stop in the middle in order to conduct his own business. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " --I think when a traffic stop is occurring, when an officer has someone stopped, we don't expect them to ignore potential evidence of criminal behavior.   In fact, we think they'd be remiss if they did.   And so we think that if the officer is able to do a dog sniff within a reasonable time, and still is reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic stop violation, it ought to be constitutionally permissible. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But then you really are saying because we have a reason to pull you over for a traffic stop, that gives us some extra time to start questioning you about other law enforcement-related things and to do other law enforcement-related business.   And I never thought that that was the rule.   I always thought is that once the objective basis -- you know, for the stop, dissipated, that was it. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Well, I -- I think if you take unrelated questioning, for instance, questioning about other -- you know, other crime, other criminal activity, I think there's a strong law enforcement interest in officers having some leeway to pursue this within a stop as long as it still is reasonable-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --You told me the officer could do that.   At least that's what I understood your answer to be. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " --That's right, the officer can do that.   And I think it's important that the officer have some leeway so long as the overall time remains reasonable.   If you think about questioning -- if the officer starts questions about where the person is going and that kind of thing, you don't -- we don't want officers to have to make finely-tuned judgements in the moment about whether the next question he wants to ask is sufficiently related to the traffic mission or not.   That's why we think there needs some leeway for the officers to take some time to pursue -- to pursue the things that they observe.   As long as they can do that within the amount of time that would be reasonable in a routine traffic stop, then we think it should be constitutionally reasonably to do that.   And I would say that I think the reasonableness analysis -- it allows courts to calibrate based on the nature and severity of the intrusion.   Under Petitioner's view, even a 30-second extension of a traffic stop for a dog sniff would be unreasonable in every case.   But if you have a reasonable analysis-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But what your -- where your rule is going to lead to, Ms. Anders, is something along the lines of, like, everybody will decide 30 minutes or 40 minutes, I think you say at one point in your brief, is reasonable for a traffic stop.   And if you see a taillight violation, that's 40 minutes of free time for the police officers to investigate any crimes that they want, because they can do it all in the range of what you've decided is kind of the reasonable traffic stop. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " --I don't think that's how we envision the analysis going, because the ultimate length of time has to be within the duration of a routine traffic stop that doesn't involve a dog sniff.   And that's going to vary based on the circumstances because routine traffic stops, what's reasonable varies based on the circumstances.   So what we think courts can do is they can look at what the officer actually did and they can look to stops involving similar circumstances but not dog sniffs, and determine whether the officer was able to do the whole thing within a reasonable amount of time.   I think that's essentially what the Court contemplated in Ornelas, that with these Fourth Amendment inquiries they're fact-specific, but, you know, the harder cases will be appealed and -- and there will start being guidelines, the courts can look to similar indications.   We think the same thing can happen here, and indeed it already has happened with respect to unrelated questioning.   There, the vast majority of the courts of appeals have said that you can extend a traffic stop for unrelated questioning, and the courts have looked to how much time does the questioning take, how long is the overall stop, and was the officer reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic mission.   And we think the same thing should happen here, whether the dog sniff is before or after the ticket.   That's the only rule that avoids arbitrary results.

Breyer", "text": " Well, then, what do you think about her response?   Because I thought it was -- I mean, she has an interesting point -- I mean, an important point.   She said, you know, the trouble with what I said which of course you think is okay -- she said it's -- it's -- here's what's really going to happen, is that the police will -- will think: Gee, I just better be sure those dogs get here in time, and so what they'll do is tend to prolong the stops, and they'll want to be sure the dogs get there.   And so if you really added all this up and thought about it, even experimentally, the class of stopped drivers where there are hunches is going to end up waiting longer and being in custody, in a sense, longer than if we follow her approach.   And her approach is just to say: Hey, apply reasonableness across the board; a few extra minutes isn't that big a deal.   I took her answer to be something like that and I thought it was, and it's a point.   It's a -- it's a point.   So what do you think? "}, {"speaker": "Shannon P. O'Connor", "text": " Well, we hope that if you look at officers' diligence there are things that will help enforce that.   One is the community.   Will the community start to accept 40-minute stops?   Will the law enforcement officer himself expect that, I'm going to stop being a police officer for 2, 3, 4 minutes when there's other things going on?   I think that's very, very, very significant.   Reasonableness -- reasonableness stops when you have the stop end.   At that point in time, reasonableness has nothing more to do with it because the person should be released until there is another reason, another purpose for the stop, a reasonable articulable suspicion, or you have consent.   Otherwise, it is done.   Here's the problem with the reasonableness.   There was the -- the statement that was made that it's not reasonable, doesn't give the officers enough time.   We're not talking about the Fourth Amendment and the officers and open season on the officers and what the officers can do.   We're talking about the Fourth Amendment and the protections that it has on the driver.   You don't look at, well, it's only going to be a minute longer if you do it this way.   The Fourth Amendment shuts it off when it is done. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What do you say about the questioning that took place in this case?   Where are you going?

That's collateral and it's nothing but an -- an investigation.   Now, the other -- the last thing that -- that I would like to do, Justice Ginsburg, is an -- answer your question as to the Eighth Circuit, and the Eighth Circuit did not make a decision as to the probable cause.   But you do have a court that did.   The trial level court did make that decision.   It made the decision that it was probable cause.

We would ask the Court to adopt the finding that there is no probable cause.   That is something that you can do as a reviewing court, because the facts have been established.   We know that the -- that the judge had problems with the credibility of the witness.   The facts that are left is not enough to -- to establish any type of reasonable suspicion.   What we do for judicial economy is you make the decision here, now, because the Eighth Circuit would have to do the same thing.   The Eighth Circuit would have to make a decision based on the magistrate's finding of lack of -- of credibility, and that's what I would ask the Court to do today. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
