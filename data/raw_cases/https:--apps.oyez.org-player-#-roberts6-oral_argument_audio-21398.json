[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning first in Case 12-17, McBurney v. Young.   Mr. Gupta. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Thank you, and may it please the Court:   All 50 States have public records laws.   47 of those States make access available to residents and nonresidents on equal terms.   Virginia, by contrast, enforces a discriminatory access policy, and because commercial requesters make up the vast majority of records requesters, out of State businesses bear the brunt of Virginia's policy-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " When -- when was the first of those laws enacted, do you know?   I think it's -- I think it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was the first to enact a sunshine law.   Is that -- am I correct about that? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --That's right.   All of these laws-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " In the '60s. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --In the '60s and the early '70s.   The Virginia law was enacted in 1968.   And we don't deny that-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " And you say that's a fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by a Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until the 1960s. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Well, to be clear, the modern transparency laws are new, but they sit on top of well-established common law rights to access that are based not on modern notions of transparency but on the right to secure property and other basic interests-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But those -- those rights still exist in this State, don't they?   Cannot you get records of deeds and whatever the common law would have covered? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Well, it's true that -- that Virginia's law exempts deeds from its Freedom of Information law, but if I understand their position correctly, they would be entitled as a constitutional matter under their theory to preclude people from other States from accessing even deeds. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, I'll ask him -- I didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but I guess we can ask them. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " My client, Mr. Hurlbert, is in the business of gathering property records for his clients.   Now, it's true that in Virginia, he could get the deed, but what he can't get and what he principally gathers for his clients are real estate tax assessment records, and those are a much richer storehouse of property-related information than simply the deed. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Can you -- can you explain that business a little more fully than you did in the briefs?   He's in the business of collecting records from all the States about tax assessments. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And he -- and he does that for a client who could very well ask himself.   So what is the service that's being performed? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Well, he -- you know, he doesn't just do the routine request.   These -- the large data companies are the ones who hire him.   And they -- if they're routine requests, they can do them themselves.   Although if they're not based in Virginia, they would still have to hire a Virginian to do it.   But they bring him in when there's some flaw in the -- the routine process where the -- the State is being recalcitrant, or the local official is being recalcitrant.   And he's an expert in being able to gather these -- these records, and knowing the process is knowing what he's allowed to do and what he's not allowed to do. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " All -- all he has to do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him, right? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Well, he could hire someone from Virginia to do that, but that's -- you know, that's sort of precisely what the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but you don't have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a letter saying give me these documents, right? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --He would still have to hire someone, and that would be an increased cost.   And-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, an increased cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right?   Go -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and when they come to your house, give them to me. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Yeah.   For the large data companies, you know, they will hire someone other than him to perform this service.   They will -- if you're talking about routine requests.   But even -- you know, even for them, if you're talking about a -- a request that isn't routine, if he has to do something further to enforce the rights, he's going to have to do that in his own name or the data company will have to hire someone other than him, someone based in Virginia, to do that for them.   And then he will lose that business.   So the lower you go down in the food chain of the data industry, the bigger the effect of Virginia's policy. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " How much -- how much of an impact in fact does it have on his business?   I mean, there are 47 States who will provide this information. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Well, for him, in the Virginia market, it completely forecloses him from doing access -- business in the Virginia market.   And if other States were to have policies like this, he wouldn't be able to do business in those States as well.   So if -- if the focus is on him and his business in Virginia, it completely cuts him off.   If the focus is on -- on what the effect is in the aggregate on the market as a whole, because most public records requests are commercial requests, it's going to have an effect on most commercial requesters who are out of State.   And-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Mr. Gupta, I -- I understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not allowing out of State people to -- to get these FOIA requests is the following: That the purpose of these -- these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were enacted -- government in the sunshine.   The purpose of it was not to enable people to get information per se, it was to enable people to see how their government is working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance that is occurring in the process of government.   It seems to me entirely in accord with that purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens who -- who are concerned about the functioning of Virginia government, and ought to be able to get whatever records Virginia agencies have.   What's -- what's wrong with that reasoning? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --A few responses, Justice Scalia.   First, transparency was one purpose, but as I said, these laws also carried forward the much more longstanding rights to access based on personal interests and property interests.   Also, even at the time that these laws were enacted-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But -- but you don't need any personal or property interest under these laws.   You can just -- out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a Virginian at least in Virginia, even though you have no interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency for records about this or that.   It -- it can't be based on -- on the traditional property interest.   It's based on the ability of the citizens of the State to find out what the -- what the government of the State is up to. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Even -- even at the time that these laws were enacted in the -- in the '60s, it was well-understood that they were going to have a big commercial impact.   The property records industry was in full swing by the end of the late 19th Century. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But the point is that FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens should know what their government is doing.   And you don't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part of that political community.   Now, Virginia doesn't allow people from out of State to vote.   They're not part of Virginia's political community.   So why isn't this -- if you're not part of the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA, which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't have to give any reason for it. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Right.   Well, elections just simply don't work if you -- if you allow noncitizens to participate in elections, or if you can't wall off the State in that respect.   But what the State can't say is simply because one purpose of this law is that we want to constitute ourselves as a political community, that we can exclude activities that have a big commercial effect.   And, you know, when we're looking under the Dormant Commerce Clause or under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, this Court's cases have said repeatedly you don't look to uncover the original legislative purpose, you look to whether there is discrimination, which there is here on its face, and you look to whether there is a discriminatory effect.   One example of how this policy is actually being-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And is the only thing that's necessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's necessary that the law affect a few people commercially?   I mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to be engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order for your arguments to work? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Well, what this Court has said is that there is no de minimis exception if there's discrimination against commerce, but here, what's going on is anything but de minimis.   Virginia does not deny that the -- the vast majority of the requesters are commercial requesters, the vast majority of out of State requesters are commercial requesters.   Their -- the amicus brief supporting their side, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia amicus brief at page 30 explains the way this policy is being implemented, is that noncommercial requests are typically honored, but out of State requests by data miners are being categorically denied under the policy. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But this is not -- this is not a regulation of commerce.   It's a State practice that may have an incidental effect on commerce, and the incidental effect may be disproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or local, but it's not a regulation of commerce. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " But that's -- that was the Fourth Circuit's theory and I think incidental can mean a few different things, and I think in -- in their opinion, it -- it does mean at least three different things.   So maybe it would be helpful if I try to unpack that.   If it means incidental in terms of the effect on my client's business -- I think, as I've explained, it's anything but incidental; it completely forecloses him from the market.   If it means incidental in terms of the -- the aggregate effect of this statute, again, it's not incidental because the vast majority of -- of affected parties under this policy are out-of-state commercial requesters, particularly data companies.   And, you know, if it means incidental compared to the purpose of the statute, as I've said, transparency was one purpose of the modern FOIA laws, but they also subsumed and sit on top of all of the longstanding rights of public access that have been around since the -- the first settlements in the United States -- or before the United States, when in order to have a functioning property system, we recognized that you've got to have records of who owns what and -- and those records have to be made available to anyone in order to exercise property rights. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What if the State of Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia businesses and so we're going to open a business training, best practices institute where you're going to learn how to be a better business person, but the only people who can come in are -- are Virginia businesses. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Under your theory, because that will have an effect, an incidental effect on commerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is that unconstitutional? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " I don't think so.   And there are a couple of distinctions.   First, that's not something that the State exclusively is able to provide.   It's not like the courthouse or the public archives across the street or the road that runs between them that only the -- the State is able to provide.   Anyone can provide a business training institute, so the State is just one player among many.   Also-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But that -- that just goes to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the principle.   And you say extent doesn't matter.   You say there's no such thing as a de minimis exception.   So that -- that explanation doesn't -- doesn't seem to me to hold water. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Well, maybe I didn't explain it very well.   To be clear, I think it's more than just a difference in degree; it's a difference in kind.   These are fundamentally different when -- when you're talking about running the courthouse or running the public archives, nobody else can do that.   Nobody else can collect -- you know, make tax assessments, collect those records and keep the official public archive of those things. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So what?   Except to the extent that that bears upon how much of an imposition this is upon interstate commerce.   It seems to me that's the only relevance of that point. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Well-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " And -- and you dismiss that relevance.   You say it doesn't matter how extensive the impact is on -- on interstate commerce. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Well, to the extent that you -- you think it does matter, I mean, that -- that distinction doesn't matter in this case because the impact is -- is great.   The principal impact is an impact on out-of-state commerce.   But let me-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Is that -- when you're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --No.   I think this -- if you were in -- in the dormant Commerce Clause, this would be the per se rule of invalidity.   You have facial discrimination.   The -- the-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I thought if it was facial discrimination, you're not concerned about impact. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --That's right.   That's right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I thought a question of talking about the effects on interstate commerce, that's the, you know, the Pike analysis. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " No.   What this Court has said is that -- that the first -- sort of first-tier scrutiny, the per se rule is -- is for cases where there's discrimination on its face or discrimination in effect.   And then you've got this other category for the -- the Pike analysis where the State regulates evenhandedly. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " What's your closest case in support of the proposition that this is impermissible as a discrimination against interstate commerce?   What's your best case? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " When you say \u201c this \u201d, you mean the -- that public records access is commerce? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " If -- if you -- you are arguing, as one of your arguments here, that this is discriminatory as to -- as to interstate commerce, as I understand your argument, what is the best case you have to support your position?   What's the closest case? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Well, I think if you're -- if you're -- if the question is about whether or not records access is commerce, there's Reno v. Condon this Court's unanimous-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, my question is what's the best case you have for your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Well, I think, you know, this Court's unanimous decision in Reno v. Condon held that because people buy public records and sell them in interstate commerce, that's indisputably interstate commerce.   So we-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But that wasn't a discrimination.   That wasn't a-- "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " --That's just -- that goes to the question whether or not this is commerce. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " That -- that's right. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " What is your best case to show that this is discriminatory in violation of our precedence? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Well, Virginia doesn't deny that there's discrimination on its face, so I take your question to be asking, you know, what about the commerce aspect.   And in Reno v. Condon-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " If I have to write the opinion, what case do I put down?   I'm waiting. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Yeah, I mean, you -- okay.   So you can also look to Camps Newfound, which, I think, you know, was much, more attenuated to commerce.   There you had a generally applicable law, a property tax law-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If I only have time to read one case-- "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --or possibly two, which would you like me to read?   I think that's basically the question. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Yeah.   I mean, you know, look.   There's no case that's -- that's entirely on all fours, but-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   But I assume you don't want me-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " That's why you're here. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --So right.   So -- so -- okay.   So the Camps Newfound case is -- is a case where you had a generally applicable law.   It was a property tax law.   It exempted, you know, charities that served primarily in-state residents.   It was -- there is no evidence that the State of Maine intended that to be a, you know, a discrimination against commerce, and obviously swept more broadly and affected both commerce and non-commerce.   But this Court said that, you know, you had facial discrimination against commerce because there were people operating these summer camps and they were treated differently-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --Look at those.   But I think the Commerce Clause basically has as its objective, insofar as it's dormant, to prevent a legislature or decisionmaker within its State discriminating in favor of their own state producers. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now, it's pretty hard for me to put this case into that mold. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Well, I mean, one -- you know, one piece of evidence, Justice Breyer, is the media exception to the Virginia statute.   It -- this -- this makes it clear that Virginia was aware that people who were requesting information for commercial purposes were going to use this statute and they exempted the press-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Just Virginia media, though, isn't it?   Isn't it only media that-- "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --That's right, Justice Scalia. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --exists or is broadcast into Virginia? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " That's right.   So it's -- it's-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So that's consistent with their purpose that this statute is meant to assure good, honest government in Virginia. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Well, if this is a statute, it's a pretty unusual statute that discriminates among newspapers.   So it says-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If it does what the -- I had exactly the same question for both parts of your argument, that, what it's their -- am I right in thinking that anyone can get any information -- anyone in any State can get any information that pertains to him or her?   Is that right or not? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --There is a separate Virginia-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Is that right or not? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Yes.   There is a separate Virginia statute that allows this. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   That's what I wanted to know, whether it's separate or not. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Anyone from Alaska to Hawaii can get any information that pertains to him or her.   Second, that this has nothing to do with judicial records.   There is a different statute that makes judicial records public. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " That's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   So we're now talking about the class of information other than the two classes I've mentioned.   And I then ended up, and I'd like you to add something to this, if you can, that really this is about, since getting information involves usually a benefit to the recipient, but sometimes harm to the person the information is about, that willing to run that harm and risk of harm is the interest in State good government, okay? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now, if that's the interest, that's an interest that probably a State has the right, just as it has the right to say other people can't vote in State elections.   If that's the interest, then I guess it could take reasonable measures related to that interest.   All right.   Now, that is the -- the argument or the position that I would appreciate your addressing. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Sure.   You know, that -- we don't deny that that's an interest that the State has, but then you have to see whether the -- the interest is reasonably furthered by the statute.   And here you have a resource that is not finite and the statute allows the State to recoup its expenses.   So nothing is lost to Virginians.   There isn't any loss in transparency to Virginians by extending access to out-of-state data companies. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But if it costs for Virginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and if it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's going to cost the State.   It's going to have to hire people to do this.   They're going to have to spend many hours going through these records.   So the State doesn't -- it wants to conserve its resources for its own people. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " But -- but there's no loss in resources, Justice Ginsburg, because the statute allows Virginia to fully recoup any administrative expenses. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, I'm having-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But they -- but they just don't want out -- they -- they don't want outlanders mucking around in -- in Virginia government.   It's perfectly okay for good old Virginians to do that, but they don't want outlanders to do it.   Why -- why is that unreasonable? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Yeah.   That -- that is certainly their interest.   But you've got to see whether the policy serves -- serves, you know, the interest, and -- and this is a statute that is supposed to promote transparency.   It actually makes less transparent. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Counsel, I'm -- I -- there is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental belief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the alliteration simply because the statute discriminates between citizens and noncitizens.   Is that your position? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " No, not at all.   I mean-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So if it's not, what are the two rights that you -- or what rights are it that you're claiming have been violated?   You say privileges and immunities.   What's the privilege or immunity? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --It's the privilege or immunity of pursuing a common calling across State borders.   So there's no dispute here that Mr. Hurlbert's common calling is -- is gathering data.   In fact, those are the principal users of public records laws. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So is this an as-applied challenge to the-- "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --All right. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So this is an as-applied challenge. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Yes.   So -- so it's an as-applied challenge with respect to Mr. Hurlbert's common calling.   There's no -- there's no dispute that that is his common calling and that this law has the effect of completely cutting him off from pursuing his common calling in the Virginia market and that 47 other States-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Then you would be doing something very strange with this statute, because you would be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because it's his business.   But the statute, the character of this statute is it doesn't matter what you want the information for.   But you're saying the out-of -- the in-Stater, it doesn't matter.   Out-of-Stater, is it your argument that if this out-of-Stater has a good reason for getting this and it's related to the out-of-State's business, so you -- you're changing the character of a FOIA statute which is it doesn't matter what you want it for. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Right.   I mean, you would, you know, we would -- we would ask that you rule that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him and then Virginia would have the choice if it has a to the statute-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I'm having a problem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's problem, which is absent the statute, he can't demand that Virginia provide him with this information because that's how he wants to work, correct?   So what's the added value that gives him a right to demand it merely because a statute exists?   He doesn't have a right to the information. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Well, he's -- all he's asking for is information that's available in the public archives on equal terms with Virginians.   In the same way that -- that someone who-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " He -- he has a very reasonable request in my view, but the question isn't the reasonableness of his request.   The question's, you know, whether they can do it.   And the -- the way -- the work -- the thing that's bothering me on the work part is this: It seems that the work is sort of tailored to the statute.   It's in this way.   I -- I have a job and my job is to study election processes.   And I write reports and I find amazing things about differences among States.   They're truly amazing.   And I say, you know, it would help me a lot if I was actually a voter in each of these states.   That would help my job.   It would lend authenticity and I could learn things that I probably couldn't learn otherwise.   Now, does that add anything to the argument?   I mean, I don't think so, but it sounds a little bit like you're making that kind of argument-- "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --No. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --and -- and they either do have the right or they don't.   And I don't know that it helps that I -- that I say, well, I really want it for my work. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Right.   But this is -- this is a profession that has existed since the founding era.   I mean, we've, you know, we've cited cases in our opening brief of -- of people hiring professionals to search the records for them before engaging in property transactions.   By the late 19th Century, you had an enormous industry that was designed to do this.   So this isn't -- Mr. Hurlbert isn't some -- someone who's making up some profession.   He's part of a very large industry that has done this for a very long time.   And that industry, yes, like lawyers depend on courthouses or truckers depend on roads, his industry depends on access to the public archives.   And, you know, it's true that -- that now you have these modern public records laws, but I -- I think Virginia's argument would be the same if you were just talking about can -- can they bar the doors to the archives building?   Can they bar the doors to the property records?   So there's no -- I don't see any distinction in kind-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Is this -- is this your Privileges and Immunities argument or your dormant Commerce Clause argument? "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --You know, I think the logic of both arguments are similar, but I think it most clearly is illustrated in the Privileges and Immunities context where-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So then it's not enough that this is a big deal to your client.   It has to be something that is essential to hold the country together as a national unit.   And it seems to me it's a bit of a stretch to say somebody gathering records about commercial -- under FOIA fits that description. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --I don't think it's a stretch at all, Justice -- Chief Justice.

And if you run that statute, you will find that between 1830 -- 1813 and 1840, that you did not have general access.   They went back to having to show a particular interest.

Now, you've protected that.   But in today's world, it's important that we get statistics about this, too, because our economy is national.   If we understand how States are taxing their real estate, we will know to what extent they increase the value, to what extent they increase the rate, to what extent they really get the money they are supposed to, to what extent they might get money or not get money in the future.

The documents in the -- in the tax assessor's office of the County of Henrico are not things or persons in commerce, nor are they channels or instrumentalities of commerce.   They are just the records of the sovereign, which we will allow our citizens to obtain.   Unless the Court has further questions, I think this argument has been developed from our standpoint.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA--   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS-- "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " Thank you.   Just a few quick points.   First, I just want to clear up on the statute, I want to make it clear that this statute does allow the State to fully recoup its costs, including administrative costs, and the State hasn't said otherwise.   And secondly, the suggestion has been made-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me.   The -- I -- I think what he's saying is: You don't have to pay the costs of developing and maintaining those records, which costs are paid by the citizens of Virginia, which gives them an additional interest in being able to get to those documents.   You -- you don't claim that -- that you pay for the development and the maintenance of those records.   You just pay for the incremental costs of giving it to you, right?

And I think this gets to -- Justice Breyer asked for our test to try to differentiate this from other services and I'd like to try to provide one.   I think, at least where you've got a function that is reserved to the State -- only the State can do it, only the State can run the archives -- it's necessary as a channel to -- to commerce.   And in the -- in the modern economy, this is as much part of the information infrastructure as transportation is, like courthouses, like archives, like roads.   It would not stretch limited resources; it would not cost the State additional money; and it would not jeopardize important local traditions or institutions-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Are you leaving out-- "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --and I think we feel comfortable-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " --Are you leaving it -- you -- you switched now -- and you were led there but you switched to the Dormant Commerce clause.   What about your other client, McBurney?   He doesn't have any Dormant Commerce clause claim. "}, {"speaker": "Deepak Gupta", "text": " --Right.   And I -- I think the test that I just laid out would work for both clauses.   It's a limiting principle on the justification side.   But that's right: Mr. McBurney does not have a Dormant Commerce clause claim.   His claim is based on equal access to proceedings.   He wanted to get recovery of child support that he was owed.   So he is a creditor seeking to pursue a debt on equal terms with people in the state of Virginia, and the State set up a process: As one step along the way to court, you go to the agency; you ask the agency to enforce.   The agency has unique enforcement tools.   It can suspend someone's driver's license, for example.   It can -- it can intercept income tax refunds, and it can go to court on your behalf.   And all he's asking for is the rules of the game.   He wants to know what procedures apply to that process.   And at least where a -- an agency has a process that directly affects a non-stater in the pocketbook, all we are saying is that equal access to the proceedings means equal access to the information governing those proceedings.   And, finally, I would just like to close by saying that, you know, what I don't think we heard on the justification side from the State was really any justification, because the State can recoup its costs.   And so they are not saying that this will cost them anything more.   Which was the only justification they pressed in -- in the courts below.   And so they are left with the position that they can discriminate simply because they think they can.   And if you look at the Privileges and Immunities clause, it sits right next to the Full Faith and Credit clause, which indicates, if anything, that the Framers thought that the movement of public records across state lines was important to interstate comity.   They changed the Articles of Confederation version, which did not include public records; it only referred to judicial records.   They added a mention of judicial records -- nonjudicial records and saw that that was important to -- to comity across state lines.   But -- but their position is about the step before that.   It's about whether you get the records in the first place.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " --Thank you, Counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
