[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll -- we'll hear argument first this morning in Case 21-418, Kennedy versus Bremerton School District. Mr. Clement. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Coach Kennedy took a knee at midfield after games to say a brief prayer of thanks, his expression was entirely his own. That private religious expression was doubly protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses. When the School District fired him for that fleeting religious exercise out of endorsement concerns, it not only violated the First Amendment, but it -- it ignored a veritable wall of this Court's precedents that make clear that a school does not endorse private religious speech just because it fails to censure it. As much as the District would like to change the subject, the record is clear that Coach Kennedy was fired for that midfield prayer, not for any earlier practices.   And the record is equally clear that the District's sole reason for its actions was out of endorsement concerns, not concerns for band members' safety or how many players joined the coach in the prayer. In fact, Coach Kennedy was disciplined for events at two games in particular, October 23 and October 26.   At the first of those games, it is undisputed that no one joined the coach in his prayer.   Nonetheless, that solo prayer was Exhibit A in his firing. Exhibit B was the October 26 game, when no players joined him in the prayer.   Yet, nonetheless, the District, throughout this case, both contemporaneously and to the EEOC and in deposition, has confirmed that the sole driving force behind its actions has been avoiding endorsement. The Ninth Circuit held that the District's actions not only comply with the First Amendment but are compelled by it.   That decision is flatly inconsistent with this Court's precedents.   The Ninth Circuit's government speech holding ignores this Court's statement in Garcetti that -- that -- to avoid overly broad job descriptions.   And the Ninth Circuit's Establishment Clause holding fails to grasp a basic teaching of this Court's cases that has been said over and over again and is simple enough for even young students to understand, that the government does not endorse all private religious speech just because it takes place on the school side of the gates. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Mr. Clement, just so I'm clear, are you pursuing -- below, you had a free exercise claim and you had a free speech claim.   Which are you pursuing? Are you pursuing both now, or are you pursuing them separately, or is this sort of a hybrid claim argument you're making? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Thomas, we are pursuing them both.   They're both fully preserved in this Court, but I do think you're right in the sense that this is a hybrid-type case in which the Free Speech Clause and the Free Exercise Clause reinforce each other, and I think it directly enforces how -- it reinforces how the Court should approach the case because, when a government acts not because it's trying to maintain discipline in the school or maintain order or avoid disruption, but it's taking action precisely because the speech is religious and the school fears endorsement concerns, that's a case where strict scrutiny applies, and it's not just a case for ordinary Pickering balancing. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So where does Garcetti fit in? I mean, it seems as though that's muddying the water a little bit because you would not normally think of a free exercise claim as being amenable to Garcetti. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I think that's a fair point, Justice Thomas.   I guess, if the -- if the -- if the statement really is the government's own speech, then I don't think you'd have the basis for either a free speech claim or a free exercise claim. It may be, though, that in deciding whether or not the coach's speech is his own speech or the government's speech, you might apply a slightly different test in the free exercise context than you would in the free speech case.   But either way, I think we are comfortably on the private side of the Garcetti inquiry because the Garcetti inquiry asks whether this is part of the coach's jobs due -- job duties. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, we know it's not a part of his job, especially since the School District didn't know anything about it initially and it objected to it.   So it can't be a part of his job. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, that's music to my ears, Justice Thomas.   And I would say, even beyond that, we know it's not part of his job duties for at least two other reasons. First of all, his job duty was not some all-encompassing responsibility for the players after the final whistle blew because the record is clear that he was able to have a private conversation, greet a spouse, and do things like that -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " But how could you make a free exercise claim and say it's a part of his job? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " We're not.   So we're -- we're saying this isn't part of his job, so it's private speech, and, therefore, under free speech principles, it's subject to -- in our view, ultimately, because the government's action is religiously based, it's subject to strict scrutiny.   But we'd also say, because it's not part of his job, it's private religious activity that's protected by the Free Exercise Clause. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Clement, I -- I -- I have been trying to parse this out in a similar way to Justice Thomas, but let me just give you a certain number of hypotheticals, and tell me what's -- when it becomes private and when it's still public. A teacher begins each of her classes with a silent prayer and an audible prayer. Now, when I say \"begin,\" the bell rings, students are coming in, they sit down, teacher says the prayer privately or publicly.   Is that within her duties as a teacher? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I would think so, Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Why? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Because it's -- it's during instructional time.   It's during a time where she has instructional duties -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How about before the bell rings? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So the -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Students are coming in.   She's reading the Bible.   She's reading it out loud before the bell.   Is it the bell that makes it within the time or not within the time? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I would say the bell is what makes your first hypothetical a relatively straightforward one. As to your second hypotheticals, because I think there's two things there, I think, if the -- if the -- if the teacher were, before the bell, reading her Bible at her desk either silently or barely audibly, that would be private speech.   That would be protected. If before the bell but while the students are all there she's reading out loud to the class, I think that's -- that's kind of the -- the edge case, because there -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So let's take it to the end of the class.   The class -- the students are getting up.   It is part of everyday life that as students leave they stop and they talk to the teacher.   She gives them some answers to their questions about the lesson. But, instead of doing that, instead of waiting for those questions, she decides, I'm going to say a prayer.   Is that within her duties to -- to -- is that personal, or is that still something that will be perceived as part of her work there? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Sotomayor, I think that's closer to the edge case, and I think what it would -- it would depend on, again, first of all, if, after the bell rings, she's reading the -- the Bible, because she's free to do whatever she wants, and she chooses to read the Bible and she does it either silently -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But she's not free to do everything she wants.   She's required as part of her duties to be available to the students and answer their questions. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, then it might be a situation where the -- in -- in that hypothetical, where she is essentially supposed to be continuing to have some instructional obligations to the kids and she's not free to text her spouse -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, then -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- check her email -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- let's take that, okay? She's not free to do that because it's personal, she could do it, but it's personal speech, not religious speech, to text her husband or to check the Internet. Could she be fired for texting her husband during school hours? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I think, if I'm understanding the hypo right, if it's a neutral rule, doesn't single out religious expression -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No -- no neutral rule.   This is, if she does something that's private on office hours, this is her employer, her employer says to her, don't do private things when you're working, and she does it anyway, can she be fired? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So that is a neutral rule as you're explaining it to me.   I think that's important to my answer. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Any rule. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I just want to -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But -- but -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- I just want to make sure that's common ground.   It's a neutral rule that you can't do anything private. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But why does it have to be a neutral rule? Meaning -- and -- and this is why I'm getting to this example. She's on duty.   She's on duty in the classroom. And the duty is not from the beginning of the bell to the end of the bell.   The duty is while she's in the classroom. So why can't an employer tell an employee what they're permitted to do, personal or otherwise, during that time? And I ask this question because I'm analogizing it to this situation.   I found it odd in your brief that you just kept saying the coach wasn't on the field during the game.   But I have a dozen or more statements by your coach telling and admitting that his duties as coach didn't -- weren't just during the game. He had an obligation to remain behind for two hours after the game finished.   That was part of his duties.   He had a duty to make sure that he escorted all the players off the field. He had a duty to make sure the other team got off the field.   He had a duty to do a post-game wrap-up both with the players and the coach.   He had a duty to clean up and to make sure that the gym was left in good order. So I guess what I'm asking is, if he had all these duties and your employer says to you, these are the duties that you have and that's all I want you to do, why can't it choose to say, and the one duty I don't want you to do is to do this one because you are an example to your players? You admit that that's part of your duties. If it's not part of his duties to set the example the school wants, why can't the school fire a coach who decides to put a Nazi swastika on their arm and go to the middle of the field and pray? If someone comes up and says, that's part of my religion, could the school say no to them? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Sotomayor, I think there were maybe three different hypotheticals there, and I'm going to try to deal with them as best I can. If somebody wants to have sort of a Nazi emblem, but it's not religious, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Assume it's religious. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " But, if it's not religious -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Assume it's religious. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I'm happy to assume it's religious.   If it's religious, that might be -- if it's claimed to be religious, that might be one of the rare cases where you question the sincerity of the religious belief because I'm not really aware of that religion myself, but assuming it's a sincere religious belief, there's no basis to discriminate on the basis of religion, and so the -- the -- the -- the -- the school might have to address that through a neutral policy, avoiding disruption, and if it's a neutral policy and doesn't single it out because it's religious, then that's something that would be evaluated under Pickering. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- can I -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- Mr. Clement, what if the -- the activity on the field did not consist of this kneeling down briefly but something more extensive, standing up on the 50-yard line, you know, arms outstretched, engaging in audible prayer? Is -- is your analysis and answer still the same? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " It's not exactly the same, Mr. Chief Justice.   I think the -- the difficulty with the sort of audible prayers or some of the practices that the coach candidly admitted he engaged in previously, where he's holding up the helmets for both teams and sort of talking to the players, is there's an instructional component to that that I think that a -- that a school district could say that -- that sincere engagement in instructional activity, and that's what the core of what coaches and teachers do, we're going to -- we're going to treat that as government speech. I think that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, he's not speaking to the players as in the, you know, example you gave, but he's praying to God. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, if -- if he's not -- if there's not an instructional component to it, if the players are -- are -- are, you know, doing their own thing in the end zone, for example, then I think it really becomes what -- the school is -- is -- is able to have a neutral rule. And this was part of my answer to another component of Justice Sotomayor's question, which is the -- the school has a fair amount of flexibility to determine what the duties of the coach are. Here, they did not say that his duties were an all-encompassing supervisory role.   And I suppose, if the school district had one coach whose whole job was to watch those kids after the bell like a hawk and make sure they didn't get into any trouble, even a brief religious exercise by that individual might be inconsistent with their neutral job duties and a basis for the school to do something. But, here, it's -- it's in the record and I think undisputed that the -- that the coach could do other things, other private things of a comparable amount of time because this is a fleeting religious exercise.   Even the School District described it as fleeting.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But would Pickering apply, Mr. Clement, if, in the Chief Justice's hypothetical, let's say he says the Our Father with arms outstretched and it starts causing a lot of havoc in the stands, a lot of the things that, you know, your opponents, your friends on the other side say that happened, that, you know, the band members were being rushed, the head coach feared for his life. If his prayer of the Our Father caused that kind of chaos, would Pickering apply, if they said for reasons of efficiency and school safety we just can't have this? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, if -- if -- if they came up with a neutral policy that tried to deal with that situation, I think you would test the neutral policy based on Pickering. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I think, if they tried to adopt the neutral policy for the sole reason of stopping the Our Father, I think that's a case where you'd say, no, that's pretextual and that's still going to be subject -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Is this what -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- to strict scrutiny, but I -- but -- but, if I could just get it on the table, but I also think, if -- if what -- if the hypothetical is that kind of audible prayer, you -- you do have the -- the argument at least that that would be instructional and might be a different case. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " One of my problems in this case was the parties seem to have different views of the facts, so I'd like to get the -- this may be a case about facts and not really much about law, and that's why I wanted to try this. I'll list six facts that I got out of the record, and just tell me if they're right or wrong.   That's all.   If you want to say they're wrong, I'll go back to it.   If you want to say they're right, good, I don't have to go back to it.   Right? Okay. One, for a long time, Kennedy would go after the game, Coach Kennedy would go to the 50-yard line and he spoke out loud a prayer of thanksgiving and he allowed students to join him. Two, when the District learned about that, it wrote to him or told him: You are free to engage in religious activity, including prayer, but it has to be physically separate from student activity and it has to be non-demonstrative, okay, if they're involved, if the students are nearby. Three, his lawyers, Kennedy's lawyers, then sent him a letter that seemed less accommodating.   It said, beginning on October 16, Kennedy will continue his practice of saying audibly just after the game by himself at the 50-yard line an audible, verbal prayer, and students could come.   And Kennedy said, I'm not going to stop my prayer because kids are around me. Four -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So am I supposed to stop you when something's not quite right in my -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah.   Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So on -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Just make -- note that. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I think it's important if you look at the demand letter that was sent on October 14 -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm about to do that. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " No, no.   That's what you were just talking about. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, no, I'm not. This is -- this is before, I'm saying -- oh, correct, you're right. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, in that October 14 letter -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- it didn't say that we want to pray with students around.   It specifically said that the coach shouldn't have to flee from students if they -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- independently and voluntarily come near him because the students also have First Amendment rights. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Correct.   But Kennedy in his letter said, I am not going to -- in his deposition, I will not stop my prayer because there was kids around me. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " He said -- that's Joint Appendix -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- page 295, I'm not going to stop my prayer -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- mid-prayer that I start by myself -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All -- all right. I'll -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- read -- go back and read that.   I'll check it because I'm going to go back and read. Four, he then advertised his plan to pray at the 50-yard line at the October 16 game, and the media all found out about it and made a big deal about it, and he was surrounded by players and a large number of spectators who rushed to the field. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, and -- and the important -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's on October 16. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " October 16, important to note that the only players that joined him on October 16 were players from the opposing team. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay.   So opposing team, got it. Five, afterwards, the District said to Kennedy: Well, you cannot engage in demonstrative religious conduct while you are on duty for the District.   Okay? But, if it's not going to be perceived as District endorment -- endorsement, we'll accommodate it.   For example, pray privately or inside the school building or on the athletic facility somewhere or in the press box, and you can do that before or after games.   And the development of accommodation is an ongoing process, and we will discuss further accommodations. And the final thing, six, is Kennedy never answered that letter. Okay.   You've got the six. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So should I -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Have you taken -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- correct you on six? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- them in? Because there are a lot of them, and I'm sorry about that.   But are they basically right with your exceptions that you -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, and -- and I was just about to add Exception 6 -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- which is -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Seven. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, no, no, but, on -- on 6, the -- the -- the record -- it's not in the record because these kind of interactions wouldn't necessarily be in the record, but there were efforts by Kennedy's lawyer to negotiate with the School District, and they would not respond.   And we pointed that out in a footnote in -- in reply at the cert stage. So this is not a situation where there is some asymmetry here that, you know, they were wonderfully accommodating and -- and we just refused to deal with them. There are lots of other facts that are in the record that I think are highly relevant here, including that no student joined him on the field on October 23, even though that's one of two specific incidents for which he was disciplined, that no players joined him on the 26th, which is the other game where he was specifically sort of signaled out for his being fired. It's also, I think, important to recognize that after the game on the 16th, the letter was sent on the 23rd, didn't say anything about safety concerns, band members' safety.   It talked eight times about endorsement.   And then, at the next home game, the only other home game in the record here, the 23rd, because the School District made clear that there weren't supposed to be people on the field, they didn't have a replication of the events on the 16th.   It's also true and -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Clement -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- I think important -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- I want to -- I mean, finish your sentence, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Sure.   I just had one more thing, which is that there were a number of these games, you know, contemporaneously right before then where the record is clear that he did engage in these kind of prayers when the -- when the players were singing in the end zone, and many of them were at away games, and there was no rushing the field, no circus, no incidents. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I -- I take it from your earlier answers that you're not contesting the right of the school district to discipline Coach Kennedy if he had been praying during the official, if you will, post-game talk? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I think that's right. We don't -- I mean -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Correct? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- we don't take an issue that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So -- so that's like -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- he discontinued that practice. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- if he were praying -- if he were a math teacher and he prayed in math class, same? If he's a coach and he prays during the post-game talk, that the school can discipline him for? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " That's right because -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And -- and -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- it would be government speech. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- just briefly, why? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Because it would be government speech. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, how -- I don't really quite know why that's the -- the operative question.   I mean, really, why? Why can the school discipline him? And I'm going to just sort of suggest and -- and -- and find out whether you agree that if you look at our prayer cases, the idea of why the school can discipline him is that that puts a kind of undue pressure, a kind of coercion on students to participate in religious activities when they may not wish to, when their religion is different or when they have no religion. Is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, look, I think it's simpler than that, quite frankly.   I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You see, I think a lot of this Garcetti stuff is not -- is -- is just not getting to the heart of what we care about, what our cases have long cared about in thinking about these questions, which is coercion on students and having students feel that they have to join religious activities that they do not wish to join, that their parents do not wish them to join. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I -- I do think it's -- it really is as simple as the government speech, but I also want to be clear, again, as we're talking about the record here, this is not a case where the government took action because of coercion concerns.   The record is crystal-clear that they were concerned about endorsement and -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yeah, I -- I mean, endorsement, coercion, I mean, you're requiring a lot of a school board to try to figure out exactly which box in the Establishment Clause to put this in. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I -- with all due respect, I don't think it's asking that much for a school district to understand what this Court has said repeatedly and said that even young students will understand -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   Assume that the School District had said the right things.   They had said, we don't really like this because it is a form of pressure, a form of coercion. We're worried that the -- that the students will feel he gets to put me into a football game or not.   He gets to, you know, give me an A in math class or not.   And this is a kind of coercion that's improper for 16-year-olds. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Kagan, in the hypothetical where the coach is giving the post-game talk, I think those kinds of concerns about real coercion may well be well placed. But, when the coach is by himself at the midfield giving a 15-second fleeting prayer, those kinds -- if you -- if you call that coercion, you are making an important category mistake. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I -- I see that point. So let me give you a hypothetical. So the hypothetical is you have a coach and he has historically been giving prayers in his post-game talk.   And then the school says don't do that.   And let's say that the school uses the right words and says don't do that because we think it poses a coercion problem.   And he says, okay, I won't do that. And -- but instead he says, you know what, I'm going to start the post-game talk a minute later than I usually do, and in the meantime, I'm going to pray, and, please, you know, join me if -- if -- if -- if you are so moved. What's a student to think at that point? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I think, in that hypothetical, the -- there well may be a coercion concern, but if instead the coach says, all right, I'm going to go to midfield, I'm going to do this at 15 seconds, I'm going to try to pick a time when most of the players are in the end zone doing something else, and if anybody asks whether they can join, I'm going to tell them it's a free country, you don't have to, but do what you want, that's this case. And that's not coercion that counts under the Establishment Clause. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So is -- is -- is that the question of this case, whether the facts are my facts or your facts? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " That's one of the questions in this case, but why it matters -- and, honestly, I think the record's crystal-clear on this.   I mean, we have a record this time around.   I don't think the Joint Appendix and the rest of the record is ambiguous on this point. But the reason the factual difference is important is because, if you don't distinguish between the two situations, then you're leaving teachers and coaches in a position where there's no material room for their free exercise of religion or their free speech, and that's exactly what this Court said is not the case in Tinker. And so -- and -- and, again, the concerns -- the reason it gets back to government speech at least in my view is because one technique that the Ninth Circuit used to approve this is one of these excessively broad job descriptions. And I think, with all due respect to Justice Sotomayor, her hypothetical built in this idea.   If -- if you say the job description of teachers and coaches is to be mentors, and if the mentors are religious, the students who depend on them for playing time and grades and all of the rest are going to want to curry favor and they're going to engage in their own religious practices or conform or at least feel pressure to do so.

What do I do with the fact that parents complain that their children wouldn't follow their directives not because they wanted to pray but because they felt pressure to pray? What do I do with the fact that when the coach was -- the school explicitly said students don't have to come if they don't want, many of them didn't? Some still did, but many of them didn't.

Breyer", "text": " One quick question, I think, from prior cases.   The -- the problem of prayer in school has been the fact that -- that there are 54 different religions in the United States now, and so what -- going back to the 18th Century, 17th Century, what we're worried about is maybe it's -- here, it was the satanists, but, I mean, it could be, you know, the Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Shintos, Mohammedans, and one group thinks why this group is being favored by the school, the other one thinks what about this one and so forth.   So we have a kind of neutrality. Now it's the same question.   Right after the game, right before the bell rings in the morning, the teacher, the coach, says let us pray, prays out loud, and students join. And, indeed, this one told all the press, so there were going to be a lot of people there.   But leaving that out, this doesn't seem like a new problem.   It just seems like a line-drawing problem about the 50-yard line just after the game when the school said don't do it on the 50-yard line, do it 10 minutes later, and -- and do you see what's bothering me? And am I right about how to see the case? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I -- I -- I see what's bothering you, but I don't think you're right to perceive the case through that lens. There is a big difference between a teacher leading students in prayer out loud and allowing a benevolent neutrality and tolerance for a variety of views. Obviously, the school district says it's fine to take a knee after the game, but it's not fine to turn to Mecca.   Or the student that's -- the Muslim student that scored and bowed towards Mecca is going to be disciplined but not the Christian student that took a knee after scoring a touchdown. Those are problems.   That's discrimination.   But to allow individual religious exercise in the normal places -- if you tell a kid that is about to kick the potential game-winning field goal that they can't cross themselves on the field in front of 50,000 or a thousand, but what they can do, don't worry, you can -- you can go in, you could rush up to the press box, we'll put the whole thing on hold, you can do it in our prayer booth, where nobody can see you, and then you can come down and kick the field goal.   Nobody thinks that's sensible. And the one thing I would point out is the very fact that the accommodations that were offered by the School District were to leave the field and go somewhere else and do your prayer and come back demonstrates beyond all doubt that he did not have all-encompassing supervisory responsibilities after the game. Sure, he was on duty in a loose sense, but he was not on duty in a real sense or they would not have given him those accommodations. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito?

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Clement, one of the difficulties of this case is getting one's hands around the District's rationale, and as I understood, it was based on kind of our Lemon endorsement test. And you're arguing, as I -- as I hear you, that that's -- that was a mistaken test and a mistaken way to think about what the Establishment Clause requires.

"}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Not coercion.   If you look at their first letter after the October 16 game, Joint Appendix page 90 to 95, there are eight references to endorsement or endorsing, zero references to either coercion or player safety. If you look at their letter to the EEOC, which is around Joint Appendix page 130, there are again eight references to endorsement, endorsing, no references to coercion.   So it is clear what motivated their policy. As to what the right concern would be, I mean, I -- I do think real coercion from government action is something that this Court has historically looked to in the context of Establishment Clause cases, but, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his Good News concurrence and in other opinions, it's very important to distinguish between real coercion coming from the government and the kind of peer pressure, if you will, that comes from private individuals being able to engage in speech. And I think the record is clear here that we only have the latter going on here and not the former.   It's certainly not what motivated the District because, in -- contemporaneously, when they put out a newsletter to their -- their constituents, they said there's no evidence that any student was coerced here. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So what do we do about that, though? Many school districts and municipalities around the country continue to operate on this endorsement idea, and there are certainly some strains of it in our case law, as you're familiar, dating back to Lemon. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I -- I -- I think the fact that school districts continue to make this mistake even though you have said over and over and over again that tolerating private religious speech is not endorsement is an excellent, excellent reason to be as emphatic as possible in overruling endorsement cases.   If it requires formally overruling Lemon and the endorsement tests that come from that, I think that would be very helpful. But what -- what continues to happen is that there is overt discrimination on the basis of religion, as is evidenced in the record here, by school districts, who aren't evil. It's just they're doing it out of misguided endorsement concerns. And I think the time has come to be as clear as possible to make clear that that's not a proper part of Establishment Clause analysis. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan?

So I think it would be profoundly mistaken to say, well, another coach, Coach Kennedy prime, he could engage in this exact same religious exercise, but because he engaged in this previous exercise and candidly cooperated with the District, we're going to say that there's some sort of like a taint of prior practice, and he can't engage in the religious exercise.

There have been individual opinions, but let's -- we haven't applied it in the cases.   I take your point, but -- but I think Justice Kagan's point is there's a whole separate body of cases involving schools, and so Engel, Lee versus Weisman, and Santa Fe.   And Santa Fe is the football case, and so that's the most relevant one here, I think. And the question here, I think, is what's different about this from an Establishment Clause perspective than the prayer over the loudspeaker, which I think was a key fact, in Santa Fe? How would we distinguish Santa Fe from this case? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So Santa Fe is readily distinguishable.   It is an endorsement case.   So you might want to be clear that at least to that extent, it's no longer good law, but, here -- it's distinguishable.   The loudspeaker is a huge part of it. But, if you'll remember the Santa Fe case, I mean, one of the issues is the school district argued, hey, this is a facial challenge to our policy, and under the policy, it's possible for the student to give a non-religious solemnization, and so this can't possibly be invalid on its face. And the Court's response to that argument was to focus on the state action, the government's own involvement in a majoritarian election for the opportunity to give the prayer over the loudspeaker.   So, as I reread Santa Fe, I was struck by how much of the Court's analysis turned on the election aspect of the school's policy, which has no analogue here whatsoever. But, to -- to -- to give a concrete example, I do think, if -- if -- if the coach goes to the loudspeaker after the game, there's a much stronger argument that that's government speech.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And -- and, also, there's -- just to pick up on Justice Kagan's point, then you have the captive audience that seems to be at the heart of Engel, Lee versus Weisman, and Santa Fe, and the question really is, what's different here? You can answer that in any way you want, but just -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Yeah, but -- but -- but I think that, you know, the loudspeaker sort of ties this audience back to the government speech and ties it all together.   I think, you know, when -- when Mohamed Salah, you know, has a religious exercise after a goal at Anfield, the fact that the crowd is there is incidental. It's not a captive audience in that sense.   It's not -- it's not he who brought them there.   So I think it kind of comes back to government speech in that respect. And I think, when the coach takes this 15-second fleeting prayer at the end of the game with no loudspeaker, barely audible, it's radically different from the use of the loudspeaker and is much similar to Mohamed Salah, Tim Tebow, all of those things. Or think about what happens when a player gets injured on the field.   I mean, it's common practice at all levels of the game, public school, private school, you take a knee. The coach takes a knee.   The players take a knee.   Many of them presumably are praying for the player's health.   Some of them are not. Some of them are -- have their own religious traditions.   But none of that is coercion, not in a real sense, and none of it violates the Establishment Clause. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

Clement", "text": " So that's -- that's where I think making a clear message that that's inappropriate, that this doesn't matter for those purposes, that's -- that's how you deal with those problems.

It's both, but -- but -- but that's why if you take that -- if instead saying the way to deal with that is you punish -- if any -- if any coach or teacher does it, shame on them and they should be punished.

You're never going to know, and that -- that leads to the suspicions by parents, I think -- I'm just playing out what the other side is saying here -- the suspicion by parents that the reason Johnny's starting and you're not is he was part of the prayer circle. And, you know, that suspicion I don't think you can get around.   That's a real thing out there, and, you know, that's going to be a real thing in situations like this.

I also think, like, flags are kind of -- I know they're -- they're fun hypos, but they're easy cases because those are -- there's kind of no reason to unfurl a flag other than to communicate with your message -- your -- your audience, and that's not true of this kind of -- of prayer. It may be very important to somebody to do it in the place where the activities took place.   It may be that incidentally there's an audience there, but it's nothing inherent in the event for it to be sort of shown off to the audience.

And many of the concerns that Justice Kavanaugh is identifying are present.   You know, a lot of the players come because they think they're going to get more playing time if they -- if they come and show up and participate in this Christian youth group.

Clement", "text": " Well, I -- I think that if the school has a concern about that kind of activity, after-school activity, wholly off the school grounds, I mean, I think the way, if it really had a concern with that, it could try to deal with it through some kind of neutral policy.   If it could say, well, we're sufficiently concerned about that, we're not going to let any teachers have any kind of outside events at their house or something, then I think that -- that would be a neutral policy. Somebody could try to test whether that's consistent with Smith or whether Smith's good law, but -- but those are all different issues.   But I think, you know, another way that the school can deal with these kind of issues, if it's not pretextual and just designed to root out religion, is to have neutral rules that say, okay, like, we get it, there are some concerns. But the one thing I think that's clear from this Court's cases is that you can't have a prophylactic rule that says, you know, there might be some problems, and so the way we're going to solve the problem is to forbid a lot of protected speech. I mean, Ashcroft against Free Speech Coalition, among -- among other cases, says that that's verboten.

"}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I -- I think that's right.   And, again, if there's a lingering concern, the option, I think, that's still on the table is a neutral rule that sort of avoids those situations because, again, I mean, it -- it really, as -- as -- as you sort of articulate it, if -- if there's a concern, it really isn't a concern that's specific to religion in any way, shape, or form. I mean, you could have the same thing for any after-school activity if the idea is, well, you know, people are going to kind of curry favor with the teacher and participate in that, then maybe you have a rule about it, but, of course, you know, you can have that already, right? I mean, you know, think you're going to get a better math grade if you go out for the math team.

If that were the issue, there wouldn't be a case here because the District allowed that. But that wasn't good enough for Mr. Kennedy.   He insisted on audible prayers at the 50-yard line with students.   He announced in the press that those prayers are how he helps these kids be better people. And after the District closed the field to the public, he expressly permitted legislators and others to join him.   Under Garcetti, those are the functions of a coach, not a private citizen. But even if not, under Pickering, Kennedy's rights would still have to be balanced against the District's interest in controlling its events and messages, protecting the religious freedom rights of the students and their parents, and managing the workplace. Some of these kids were just 14 years old.   Mr. Kennedy's actions pressured them to pray and also divided the coaching staff, sparked vitriol against -- against school officials, and led to the field being stormed and students getting knocked down. When Mr. Kennedy repeatedly ignored sincere efforts to accommodate personal prayers, what was the District to do? If a math teacher knelt and said -- said audible prayers in class just before the bell, the School District could act. Coaches have far more power and influence, especially at the time and place of those traditional post-game speeches.

On Mr. Kennedy's theory, if the motivation for -- for that act, that act of protest against police misconduct is to -- is political, then it's subject to Pickering balancing and yet, if it is -- the motivation is religious, it gets strict scrutiny. That make no -- makes no sense, and it is also inconsistent with this Court's consistent holdings that -- that political and religious speech have to be treated the same way.

He is allowed to remain on the field for a period of time.   He is allowed to walk onto the field.   He does that by himself.   He goes to the 50-yard line.   He kneels down and he prays.   He doesn't invite anybody to go with him, but he also doesn't tell people who are also permitted on the field to go away.   And all of this is visible to people in the stands.

And on endorsement, as Justice Gorsuch says, we have not used endorsement in Van Orden, Town of Greece, American Legion, in a long time.   So let's put that to the side for the moment and I take your arguments about that. But, on coercion, and just to follow up on the endorsement point, we did not apply Lemon in Lee versus Weisman, for example, the schools case that extended Engel to graduation prayer, so that didn't happen there. On the coercion side, there are different forms of coercion, as you've been talking about.   There's actual you are compelled to be -- to say the prayer.   That's not happening here.   You're compelled to be present at an event where prayer will be spoken.   That is Engel.   That is Lee versus Weisman.   That is Santa Fe. But I think you're not saying that here either.   You're saying there's kind of an implicit peer pressure, subtle coercion, implicit coercion.   If I'm wrong about that, tell me.

That was not -- that was not, if you don't join the prayer, you'll be off the team. That was -- that was the sort of situation where students can reasonably understand, and, here, very much students and parents understood that you have to go along to get along.

On Mr. Kennedy's test, the -- the Court would ignore all of that.   Nobody's -- nobody's religious freedom rights count except for -- except for the employee's.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Rebuttal, Mr. Clement? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Just a few points in rebuttal. First, in terms of the correct test, I don't think the correct test when the government explicitly discriminates on the basis of religion is Pickering.   Religion is different. In the context of free speech, we're used to saying, well, if you just spoke over there, you had alternative methods of communication, time, place, and manner, there's some flexibility on that.   That doesn't happen in religion because it's a compelled, sincere religious belief.   If you tell a Muslim if they could just reorient themselves in the other direction, you're denying them their religious exercise.   So you need a test that is fit for religion cases, and strict scrutiny provides that. If you want to give courts and district courts -- rather, school districts guidance, the last thing you should do is replace jurisprudence that's becoming clearer and could be made clearer in this case about discrimination against religion and the Establishment Clause and replace it with Pickering.   A balancing test doesn't provide guidance. The only thing worse than Pickering, I suppose, would be a center of attention test. And that doesn't actually capture the real world examples anyways.   Right after Mohamed Salah scores the goal, he is, of course, the center of attention and he engages in a religious exercise.   Right after Tim Tebow scores the touchdown, he's absolutely the center of attention.   Yet, he engages in a religious exercise.   It's private, it's permissible, and the government can't stop it. Second, in terms of Santa Fe, we've discussed this a bunch, but my friend on the other side does say, well, wait, this is worse, this is coach speech, not student speech.   But you can't strip away all the context of Santa Fe.   If everything else were the same, sure, the fact that it was coach speech would be worse. But it's not all the same. That case, the student was using the loudspeaker as the winner of a majoritarian election to be the designated spokesperson for the school.   This case, it's the coach engaged in his private religious exercise.   He happens to pick that point at the -- the center of the field.   He's actually not the center of attention if you look at the videos, which are in the record, but -- because there's lots of other activity going on, but that's his religious exercise.   It's protected. Now, third, the record here -- I mean, the -- people seem like they dispute everything, but the record speaks for itself on this case. There are three games that are particularly relevant.   The 16th, the homecoming game, that's what my friends describe as the circus, the media circus, people coming onto the field. Well, there was a letter sent in response to that game in particular.   It's at Joint Appendix pages 90 to 95.   It uses the phrase \"endorse and endorsing\" and raises endorsement concerns eight times.   It talks about safety concerns zero times.   It talks about coercion concerns zero times.   That's the 16th. Then, by the 23rd, that's a game that is one of the two games on which the actual discipline turns.   That's a prayer where no one -- no one joins the coach in his prayer. The 26th is then the next home game. They have a much better security system that time.   They've addressed that pretextual problem, and there's a prayer.   No prayer -- no player joins it from either team on the 26th. Yet, the 23rd and the 26th are the prayers where he's disciplined.   He was not disciplined for having a state legislator on the field.   That's simply not what happened in this case. And, again, the record speaks for itself not just contemporaneously.   As I said, the score in the letter sent after the 16th game is 8 to 0.   Endorsement, 8; other concerns, 0. But then, when they lawyer up and have their lawyer send a letter to the EEOC at pages Joint Appendix 132 to 142, what concern did they express as their stated sole driving consideration? It is, again, endorsement, 8 to 0.   Eight mentions of endorsement.   Nothing else is mentioned. So I'll finish with this point. Please do not remand to the Ninth Circuit for an application of the coercion test.   There's no evidence of coercion contemporaneously.   Joint Appendix 105, the school itself stressed no evidence of actual coercion. The only evidence that showed up later was a couple of parents complaining about their students who had to turn their back on the team or separate themselves from team activity, obviously directed at the pre-September 17 activity that's no longer at issue in the case. There's no evidence of coercion in this record. But, worse still, I mean, my client has already waited six years to get his job back.   And if you imagine the parallel for this is a race case where the lower courts, both lower courts, said the sole reason the government acted was because of race, but yet we think it's okay because there's this compelling interest.   If this Court took that case up and said there's nothing to the compelling interest, it wouldn't send it back down to see if there was some other reason when the courts had already found the sole basis for the action was on the basis of race. Here, the record is clear.   Two courts that didn't agree with much of what we said said the sole basis for the government's reaction -- actions here were religion. That is not something that should stand.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
