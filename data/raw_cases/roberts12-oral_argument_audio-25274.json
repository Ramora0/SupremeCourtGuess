[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case 20-297, TransUnion versus Ramirez. Mr. Clement. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The class certified here suffers from two fatal defects: the absence of class member standing and typicality.   Each and every member of this class stands to collect thousands of dollars in damages, but the first inkling that many of them will have that they were injured will be receiving a check in the mail. The only thing the class members have in common is that they were sent their entire credit file in two envelopes rather than one and received a summary of rights only in the first mailing. But simply receiving all the requisite information in a non-compliant format is not enough to inflict a concrete injury.   And Respondent fares no better on his claim that TransUnion failed to use reasonable procedures in preparing his credit report.   Fully 75 percent of the class never had a credit report, which is distinct from the credit file sent home upon request, prepared or disseminated during the class period. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that there was a material risk that a report could be prepared and disseminated.   But there is no evidence that the risk ever materialized for over 6,000 class members, and yet they all stand to receive a sizable check. To be sure, Ramirez himself suffered significant injuries, but that just highlights the equally fatal typicality problem here. Ramirez had a credit report prepared and disseminated to a car dealer, was hindered in obtaining credit, humiliated in front of family members, and canceled a planned vacation.   That makes him entirely atypical and unrepresentative of the average class member, who simply received her credit file in two envelopes in the privacy of her own home. Ramirez suggests that only his legal claims need to be the same.   But typicality means something different from commonality, and the typicality requirement precludes a class representative with wholly atypical injuries.   A contrary rule would run counter to the basic promise that a class action is representative litigation and would violate the Rules Enabling Act to boot. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Clement, could each of the class members have sued TransUnion before TransUnion removed the OFAC designation from their reports? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice.   I mean, obviously, if this was a suit that was filed while the policy was still in place, we would probably be governed by the certainly impending standard of the Clapper case, and I think, since the evidence in this case suggests that the average class member only had a 25 percent chance that their report would be disseminated, I think that probably means that they did not have a sufficiently impending injury. So I don't think it would matter if this were brought prospectively. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, doesn't that seem a little odd? I mean, they're injured by having their names mistakenly or misleadingly on a report that might be disseminated.   They just want to take that off to avoid that risk, whether it's 25 percent or 98 percent.   I don't know why they don't have sufficient standing to at least clear that up. Maybe their damages aren't terribly significant if, you know, no one else has seen the report, but it's kind of a surprising thing that somebody with misleading information about someone, that -- the whole point is they hope somebody asks for it because that's when they get paid, and you can't do anything about it. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what you can do about it and what the statute specifically envisions to deal with this situation is you can ask for a copy of your credit file before your credit report is ever disseminated to a third party. And the way the statute envisions this works is you get your credit file, you see the information that you believe is inaccurate or misleading, and then there's a process you can initiate it to get it cleared up in -- before it ever gets disseminated to a third party. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but they've got no reason -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So there is -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- they've got no reason to ask for a credit report.   You know, they -- they've never bounced a check in their life.   They've got perfect credit.   Why would they even do that? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, if they have no reason to think they have any problem, then I'm not sure how they would even know that they were suffering a -- a risk of injury in a practical sense. But, in all events, whatever the rule is prospectively, I think, when you're talking about a retrospective action like this and a challenge to a policy that has been discontinued, then I don't think a risk really matters. I mean, if the risk didn't materialize, at that point, I -- I think that's a cause to sort of break out the champagne, not to break out a lawsuit. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Clement, if one of Petitioner's clients contracted to get the same OFAC in for -- designation information in a credit report and did not receive that for -- in any reports over a period of time, would that client have standing to sue Petitioner? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Justice Thomas, I think that that client would have standing to sue because I think contracts are different for the following reason: Just by virtue of having a contract action, I think that means that you gave consideration in exchange for the promise. So I think, when you think about a breach-of-contract case, you can think of the injury-in-fact being supplied essentially by the consideration that you gave up in exchange for the promise that people would do whatever they contracted to do even if that was relatively trivial. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I understand that that's different from a private right that's in a statute, but I don't see that that difference or distinction -- the distinction between this makes any difference.   They're both private rights. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I disagree with you on that, Justice Thomas.   I do think this involves a classic public rights regime, and I think you can see that from the structure of the statute.   This is not a situation where the statute gives the plaintiff a very specific private right to enforce a very specific prom -- promise, as in the contract. If you look at the enforcement provision, 1681n and o give the consumer a cause of action for any violation of this subchapter with respect to the consumer. And there's a hundred different requirements that are imposed on the regulated parties by the subchapter, which is the classic structure for a public rights regulatory regime, and that becomes unmistakable if you look at 1681s, which is the public enforcement provision of the statute, which equally gives the FTC the right to bring an action for any violation of a requirement of the subchapter, and they can even do that in front of the FTC itself, which, of course, is the hallmark of a public right.   So I think this is a public rights regime. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I -- the -- I'll let that go for a minute.   I -- you know, maybe with the FTC you're right.   I don't necessarily agree with you, as I suggested in Spokeo on the other part. But let's go -- what would be your definition of your test for typicality? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So my -- I would start by saying that for typicality, the named plaintiff for the class representative has to have injuries and experience that are typical of the class.   It's not just a matter of having the same claims.   I think, if you just laid down that rule of law, you would go a long way to sort of solving the problem. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " What would that leave for commonality and predominance then? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Oh, I think they have definitely -- definitely have a role to play, but they're independent roles.   I can have a common issue in a case, but I can still be a very atypical representative to litigate the common issue or even if that common issue predominates.   So I think all three of those provisions work together in a complementary fashion. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I'm interested in Justice Thomas's last question, thinking of typicality. I mean, all of these plaintiffs, in respect to every one of them in the class, the -- they -- they didn't in the first letter get all the information, they didn't get about the -- the terrorist related.   And they said that the company didn't follow reasonable procedures. And they said in the second letter they didn't get the summary of rights. So they were all typical in that respect.   But Ramirez also went out and tried to buy something and got into a lot of trouble, it was all complicated, dah-dah-dah. So, when the trial took place, would it have been possible for the lawyer for the company to have objected to the introduction of all that separate and special information about Ramirez on the ground that it had nothing to do, and was prejudicial, it had nothing to do with the typical injury suffered by the class? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Breyer, I don't think that that would have been a proper objection to raise, and -- and -- and I think the reason is that, you know, particularly with respect to the reasonable procedures claim, what Ramirez would be testifying about is information that would be highly relevant in his own individual action. And I think the Rules Enabling Act doesn't allow you to fundamentally change the rules of the road when the person is testifying in a class action versus an individualized action.   And so I think the right way to handle this problem is to pick a class representative who is, in fact, typical. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, I know what you think is the right way.   But I'm just wondering why, in a class action, where the individual who is the named plaintiff, say, suffers a head injury, and nobody else suffers a head injury, and he wants to introduce that because it had something to do with the injury, you know, it's a relationship. But -- but can't you object to that? Why not? You say, look, that -- that might have been okay in an individual action, to bring that in, but this isn't that.   This is a class action.   Let's stick to what the class action harms were.   Why can't you say that? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I don't think that's the right way to do it, and you can't do it -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- in part because of the Rules Enabling Act.   I don't think the evidence that comes in as to the named plaintiffs is supposed to be fundamentally different. But, if you look at the Ninth Circuit brief that my friends on the other side filed, they specifically said they needed to put forth the experiences of Ramirez at the Nissan dealership in order to lay the foundation for all of their claims, the reasonable procedure claims and the disclosure claims. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " The class members whose information was disclosed to third parties certainly had reason to worry about that, wouldn't you say? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, yes or no, Justice Alito.   I don't mean to resist it, but I think, given that, you know, we know that, you know, roughly 1500 people had their reports disseminated and nobody other than Ramirez complained, I -- I do think there are a lot of people in this class who had it disseminated and maybe the person on the other end took a quick look at the birth dates, saw that they were radically different, went ahead with the transaction, having no harm/no foul. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, is there really no harm? Suppose someone gets this information, asks for the credit report, gets the information, and sees that the person has been flagged as someone whose name resembles the name of a person who's on this list.   Doesn't that inflict some psychological injury on the person who gets that information? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I don't think so, Justice Alito.   I mean, you know, I -- I read a report that -- that late Senator Kennedy ended up being on the No Fly List or some list associated with the No Fly List for secondary screening, you know, that I think he managed to get it cleaned up, and I'm sure it was a little bit of an inconvenience for him to be on the list. But the bare fact of knowing that you're on a list or share a name with somebody who's on a list, I -- I -- I don't know that that really is injury-in-fact.   Of course, even if it is, that's only 25 percent of the class. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Let me shift to a different subject. If we were to agree with you -- and this is an if -- that the district court should have certified only a narrower class, only those whose information was disclosed to third parties, can that be remedied simply by precluding recovery for those not in the class, or did that possibly overbroad certification hurt your client in some other way that can't be untangled? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I think it did hurt my client in ways that can't be untangled.   I think it may have even prejudiced the plaintiff a little bit, given that the jury may have sort of thought about the size of the class in -- in -- in making the award.   It's a little hard to completely unpack it. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, how -- in -- how -- in what ways might it have hurt your client or did it hurt your client? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, the -- the -- the -- the jury did hear evidence that, you know, suggested that we did this to, you know, thousands of people, when, you know, that's actually not the case based on the premise of your -- of your question.   So I do think that's quite prejudicial to us. You know, there's also sort of the theoretical problem that I'm not sure that when a court proceeds on the assumption that it is exercising jurisdiction over all the absent class members, that you just sort of, you know, at the end just say, well, never mind, we'll just sort of fix that by sort of sticking this to the 25 percent. I would also just add we don't think that Mr. Ramirez was typical even as to the 25 percent. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   Thank -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So we think because of the typicality -- yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Thank you.   My time is up.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, I read Rule 23(a)(3) as requiring typical claims and defenses.   Mr. Ramirez's claims were not subject to any unique defenses, and they were identical to every class member's claims.   Everyone in the class was designated a potential match with someone else on the OFAC list because of the same unreasonable process, and everyone received the same two mailings in response to requests for their credit files. Now you object to Mr. Ramirez's atypical harms or potential individual damages. But I don't see where Rule 23(a)(3) requires typical damages, number one, so how do you square your argument with the text of the rule? But, number two, when you raised this issue before the district court, it suggested a verdict form that would let the jury award different statutory damages for class members who experienced different harms.   That seemed like a very reasonable way to handle the situation.   But TransUnion didn't ask for such a form.   It didn't object to Mr. Ramirez's testimony or seek discovery from absent class members. I -- I just see this as a trial error, not as -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- an error in certifying the class, and the trial error was invited by you, so I -- not by you personally but by counsel below. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So, Justice Sotomayor, let me respond to both pieces of the question. First of all, I think, textually, on Rule 23(a)(3), it requires the claims and defenses to be typical.   I don't think it answers the question of whether that means that, with respect to the claim that needs to be typical -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, don't you -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- you look at the various elements -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- think that this is a typical claim? Meaning this is exactly what this law was intended to avoid.   He's as typical a claimant as one could imagine with respect to the law at issue.   This is exactly why the law was passed, to protect people from exactly this situation, the situation he faced. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " With respect, I don't think his claim is typical of the claim of the average class member.   I mean, I would liken it to if -- if my fingernail is broken, and I represent a people -- a class of people with broken fingernails, but my fingernail was broken in the process of having my hand mangled, I don't think I have a typical claim.   I don't think I'm a typical class representative. And I think you would -- you would say that textually by saying I just -- my claim is different.   It's not typical.   It may be the same legal claim, but it's not a typical one. And typicality asks for something more than commonality. As to the trial error, with all due respect, I think, if you look at -- we actually proposed a jury form that allowed the jury to say that with respect to the statutory damages, you couldn't find that every member of the class was entitled to statutory damages. We -- that, you know, it was -- it was Ramirez or no one or -- and -- and under our proposal, you can't say one -- you know, one or all.   That was rejected.   And throughout this case, the other side was the one saying that we can just get one number for the statutory damages award, and that's why individualized damages don't predominate. So I don't think this was a trial error, with all due respect.   And we certainly prepared -- proposed a case -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   I've run out of time. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Clement, suppose that there's a carcinogen which, when it is in your drinking water, you have a 50 percent chance of getting cancer, and suppose Congress passes a law that everybody exposed to that carcinogen can sue and obtain statutory damages, and suppose that there's a class action of people exposed to that carcinogen. Does that satisfy Article III? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I think that probably would, Justice Kagan, but, if this were a weird carcinogen that worked in such a way that, like, a year later, you could tell whether you were in the 50 percent risk or the 50 percent safe category, and then you sued for statutory damages retrospectively on behalf of the people who averted the risk, I think you might have a different result but certainly worth thinking -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yeah, so that's interesting, Mr. Clement, because that takes us back to the question that you and the Chief Justice were talking about. Now, in my hypothetical, unlike with the Chief Justice's question, you agree that retrospectively that there -- there is standing, right? So, if you -- if you just, you know -- you're -- you're within a five-year period, let's say, nobody knows who's going to get cancer, you're agreeing that everybody could be in that class action and that there would be standing, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I -- I think so, Your Honor.   I mean, just to be clear, I think so because I think a 50 percent exposure to cancer, when you haven't figured out whether or not you are going to get it because of the exposure, I think that's an injury-in-fact.   Under, you know, the common law, it would probably be the kind of thing that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   Well, now let's suppose -- "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- someone would -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- let's suppose that this cancer works so that you either get it or you don't in five years, and let's say that this suit is brought in the sixth year, still within the statute of limitations that Congress has prescribed, and it's still the same claim -- the -- the same class.   There are both people who have gotten it and there are people who haven't gotten it. Now I would have said that if you're willing to give me that everybody has standing within the five years, it should be that everybody has standing in the sixth year as well because you have standing if you suffered harm in the past. And your concession is a concession that you have suffered harm in the past, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " No, I don't think so, Justice Kagan, but let me add one thing to the hypo to try to explain why I'm taking the position I'm taking. I'm assuming that the people who are suing in the sixth year, like, they didn't even really know about the exposure until they found out they were in the claim.   Because -- that's this case.   And those people, I think, don't get to recover.   I mean, if -- if you only -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Even though they could have recovered in the fifth year, even though they didn't know, because Congress, you know, said that they should get to recover regardless of their state of knowledge? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " But even in the process of filing the lawsuit during the five-year period, they essentially would know.   And so I -- I -- I think, you know, if -- if you were sort of subject to a risk that you didn't even know about and the risk never materialized, at that point, I don't think you can bring a retrospective action for damages. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, it -- it seems as though it's a material risk of harm in the language that Spokeo used.   No? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " In your hypo, it might be, but that's in part because it's 50 percent and it's cancer.   And I think -- you know, I -- I don't want to go all Learned Hand on you, but I think you sort of think about both the risk and the consequences.   And I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- as here -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice -- Justice Gorsuch. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Clement, why don't you go ahead and finish your answer.   I'm -- I'd be curious. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you, Justice Gorsuch.   What I was just going to say is that, you know, here, you have a 25 percent risk based on the information in the -- in the record, and then the consequences of that for everybody other than Mr. Ramirez have not been anything like getting cancer.   In fact, nobody else has registered essentially any complaint about what happened to them and being denied credit. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Is it -- is it that there's no material risk that these people faced, or is it that they didn't know about it? Which is the key to you, your argument in response to Justice Kagan? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I don't want to evade the question.   I think it's the combination of the two.   So I -- I -- but just to be clear, if you ask me did the people in this class suffer material risk, I would say no, not a material risk, because materiality has to take into account the consequences, and given that no one other than Mr. Ramirez suffered any -- any -- any consequences, I don't think that it's a material risk. I -- I also think, if you're thinking that, you know, well, maybe it's not like the risk of injury so much as it is sort of a fright that you might have, like, at common law -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " -- for a mere battery or something like that, that requires knowledge. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So -- okay.   So your -- so your argument as I understand it then is, with respect to those in the -- the group that didn't -- that didn't have their information sent to third parties, that they need to have some knowledge of the information in order to have any material risk of injury.   Is that -- is that a fair summary of what you're saying? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I think it is, Your Honor.   The only thing I would add is I'm -- I'm thinking that -- you know, if the other side is trying to argue that if what makes the material risk an injury-in-fact here is at least in part the idea that it would kind of, you know, ruin your whole day, you would be obsessed about it and concerned about it, that requires some knowledge of it in order for you to suffer an injury-in-fact. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " In order to have emotional distress, you have to have knowledge of the thing that would cause the emotional distress? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Exactly.   And I think you have to -- the other side, not me, with all due respect, has to have a theory as to how the material risk translates into an injury-in-fact, unless you think that a material risk just standing alone is an injury-in-fact, and, if you think that, I think it's got to be a lot higher than 25 percent. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   And then, with respect to the 1800 who did have their information published, when I look at, you know, the common law on defamation, publication was presumed to give rise to injury, the idea of, if something bad is said about you in public, a reason the -- the common law would presume an injury.   Why wouldn't the same hold true here? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Well, I think, Your Honor, the key thing is -- and, you know, I can try to quibble about whether it had to be defamatory per se or false, but, here, I don't think what is actually published is, in fact, false because, if you go to the OFAC website today and type in the Respondent's name, you will get a hit.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Clement.   To pick up on Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kagan's questions, let me make sure I understand the risk of harm. As I read your brief, you said the risk of harm is likely -- risk of harm alone is likely not enough for damages as opposed to injunctive relief.   At least that's how I read Footnote 4 of your brief. In response to Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch, I think you were saying -- but tell me if I'm wrong -- that the risk of harm is still not enough for damages unless the risk of harm is itself a separate harm.   In other words, the risk of harm is not cancer, in other words, you don't have the cancer, but the risk of harm may create emotional injury. Is that an accurate way to summarize what you're saying? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I think that's right, Your Honor.   And I guess the only other thing I would add is I suppose there might be certain risks of harm that are so high that maybe you think that the material risk is itself an injury-in-fact even if it doesn't manifest itself in emotional harm or some other injury-in-fact, but I don't think that's 25 percent chance of a dissemination of a credit report. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Even for damages claims? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Even for damages claims, but, as we said at the outset, I -- I do think the Footnote 4 point is very important, which is whatever your risk was ex-ante that might have been enough to get injunctive relief to stop a practice, if you're in the 75 percent that were fortunate and didn't actually suffer an injury-in-fact because the risk didn't materialize, I don't think you have injury-in-fact at that point. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " To pick up on Justice Alito and also Justice Gorsuch, if we agree with you on the six -- 6332 people but don't agree with you on the 1853 people, exactly what should we say in terms of what should happen on remand? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " So I would say that what you should say on remand is that the -- that the courts below should decertify the class, because, remember, from the very beginning, we said the reason you can't have a class here is because the issue of injury is not common to the class.   And so I think you'd essentially be vindicating the point. And I think it's also worth recognizing that I think what you'd be saying about the 6,332 is not that they absolutely positively don't have injury.   It's just you'd be saying, if they have any injury, they've got to come in and show it individually.   And that just underscores that this class of 8,000-plus was wrong from the beginning for the reasons that we pointed out from the beginning. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " And then, in response to Justice Thomas, I think you're saying that the problem here is that Congress is setting up, in essence, a shadow government of private attorneys general to enforce prohibitions on certain activities by certain entities, and that's an Article II/Article III problem, and your test is no harm/no foul. But -- but how would you succinctly describe how we determine whether there is sufficient harm as a general matter, or can that be done in a -- in a general way? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " I'm not sure that's capable of generalization.   I just think, you know, you do have to have -- the best I can do would just be to repeat what I think is the gist of the Spokeo decision, which is you need injury-in-fact.   Injury in the law won't do it. And then the one thing I would add -- and I think this speaks particularly to people that are focused on the public rights/private rights distinction -- when you have a statute like the one at issue here or like the one at issue in Fohl, where the structure of the statute is to give certain individuals, whether they be consumers here or plan participants in Fohl, a right, essentially, to enforce any violation of the subchapter, that is a strong indication that Congress has not actually made the judgment that this is a very specific private right.

She asked you to distinguish between what would happen if they filed within the five-year period in which they would know whether the risk had materialized or outside the five-year period, say in the sixth year. I want to know what would happen, say, if they filed in year two, but the litigation drags on and on and on and the case doesn't come to its conclusion until year six. So, if I understand your response to Justice Kagan, it would essentially mean that people had standing at the outset of the suit. But, if they were in the 50 percent that were home-free, they would lose their standing by the end? I mean, that just seems like an odd way to think about it since we normally judge standing at the outset, and when something dissipates over the course of a suit, we think about it in terms of mootness, not that the injury isn't concrete.   Or is this a merits determination that they didn't suffer damages? How to -- how to think about that? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D.

The only thing I would add, Your Honor, is, you know, this Court has made very clear in cases like Lujan that you do have to maintain your standing at every stage of the case. And so, you know, in -- in -- in your hypo, I think what happens is sort of the clock runs out on the injury.   But, if the evidence that ultimately emerges at trial makes clear that, as to a discrete group of people, a risk absolutely positively did not materialize, I do think you could say at that point, based on the evidence in the record at that juncture, that they don't have standing. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Okay.   Let me ask you about material risk of harm.   So, as I read Spokeo, you know, and it cites Clapper after that language, it preserves, you know, the possibility of standing in a prospective suit where harm is imminent but hasn't yet happened. And then, for slander per se, you know, there are some harms that were recognized at the common law, as we have discussed during this argument, that were presumed to cause harm because, even if you didn't have to prove that you lost a job over it, you know, that the risk was so great that in and of itself the common law tort proposed it. And it seems like this case is about whether, even going beyond that, a big risk that the tort would actually happen to you is itself a tort.   And I -- I haven't heard you disclaim that as a proper reading of Spokeo. Instead, it seems like you're talking about quantifying the risk, accepting that that could be an injury under Spokeo but only if it's an 85 or 90 percent chance of happening. Am I understanding you correctly? "}, {"speaker": "Paul D.

The district court recognized from the outset that proof of an actual de facto injury would require individualized proof and refused to certify certain state law claims on that ground.   But he excused the class from making an individualized showing of de facto injury for the FCRA claims because Ninth Circuit law did not require it at the time. But, under any proper understanding of Article III, each class member must have injury-in-fact, and this class must be decertified.   Decertification also follows because Ramirez is a radically atypical class representative.   He suffered serious injuries that would have allowed him to seek actual damages in an individual action.   But, instead, he sought statutory damages at the top of the range, plus punitives, for a class that shared few of his experiences. Rule 23's typicality requirement guards against just that kind of abuse.   The objections were repeatedly raised and rejected below.   The certification order cannot stand. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

By placing OFAC alerts on all class members' consumer reports, Petitioner created a real risk of harm that they would be denied credit, employment opportunities, or other benefits because they were wrongly labeled as potential matches to a terrorist list.   That is precisely the type of harm that Congress sought to prevent by adopting the reasonable procedures provision, and defamation provides a common law analogue. Congress also gave consumers rights to receive certain disclosures and summaries of their rights, and under this Court's informational standing cases, all class members have standing to bring claims for violations of those rights.

And I think, in addition, we look at a few different factors when considering the reasonable procedures requirement.   We don't really focus on potential of any emotional distress but look at just the risk of dissemination as to these class members.

Breyer", "text": " I have the same question, just if you want to say more about Justice Thomas's last question.   How is this different? I've always thought that a -- a -- a class of antitrust plaintiffs, all of whom have to pay higher prices as the result of price fixing, could be represented by a -- a consumer who, through an odd chance, bought a thousand times more of the product than anyone else in the class.   He just had higher damages. Or a class action against somebody for doing something that would send a victim to an emergency room could be represented by a person who was not only sent to the emergency room but, through an odd set of circumstances, was actually sent to the operating room and had to be and had all kinds of bad -- it's the same basic harm; it's just a lot worse. Well, how does this differ from that? In the examples I gave, are they not typical? Or is -- is the -- is the defendant allowed to say to the judge, Judge, don't take those non-typical things into account, the extra damages, at least not until we find liability; then you can have a class for damages, or don't consider -- I mean, how does it work? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole F. Reaves", "text": " A couple responses to that, Justice Breyer. I think, as to the two hypotheticals you gave, the first hypothetical, the antitrust plaintiffs, there might not be a typicality problem there because any differences would be easily calculated, and the court could consider that at the outside -- outset of the case and determine whether there's a viable damages model to separate different individuals out just based on kind of a mechanical mathematical calculation. I think the second example that you gave, which kind of is a liability-type example, in actuality, a lot of courts don't allow product liability-type cases to proceed as a class because individualized damages tend to -- tend to make the named plaintiff not typical or run afoul of other Rule 23 considerations. And, here, in the statutory damages context, the jury is charged with setting the amount of damages within a range.   And plaintiffs' specific experience can be relevant to that.   So, in a situation like this, where one individual, the class plaintiff, was placed on the stand and gave extensive testimony about his specific experiences, we think that there can be typicality problems there because that isn't indicative of what happened to other class members, and they might benefit from that in a way that they really shouldn't.

While I would agree and this Court has repeatedly said that there's overlap between typicality and predominance and commonality, here, it does seem that this problem fits best within the typicality bucket, and that's because typicality focuses on the named plaintiff and his claims, whereas the other requirements, commonality and predominance, focus on all the class's claims in a -- in a broader way. And getting to the second kind of point, I think that this is not a trial issue because this Court has repeatedly said that a plaintiff needs to demonstrate that he or she meets requirements of Rule 23, and this may have to be done by an evidentiary showing at the outset of a case.

Or, alternatively, he could have had somebody else testify at trial, a different member of the class.   I mean, there's no necessary relationship between who's the class representative and who testifies at trial.

The question of who testifies at trial really has nothing to do with who the class representative is, does it? "}, {"speaker": "Nicole F. Reaves", "text": " Not necessarily.

Petitioner made the reports available at a moment's notice.   And Petitioner had a high dissemination rate.

It gave credit reporting agencies broad preemptive protection from tort liability but also the responsibility to ensure accuracy and to follow specific procedures to enable consumers to challenge this reporting. Nothing in Article III restricts Congress's power to create those rights.   The class alleged and proved invasion of particularized statutory rights granted to them, not the general public.   The common law has long recognized a concrete interest in economic reputation and afforded an inferred remedy without proof of actual damages. TransUnion created an explosively high risk of harm by placing OFAC designations not in the secretive draft -- desk drawer but in the readily accessible credit files of innocent Americans.   As the SG argued, TransUnion's business was the dissemination of information to third parties.   No dissemination, no profit. Both courts below found that the claims asserted were the same for all class members, following the text of Rule 23(a)(3). Mr. Ramirez's accuracy claim stems from TransUnion's systemic failure to ensure accurate OFAC reporting, and his disclosure claim stems from the same two non-FCRA-compliant letters sent to every class member.   All class members sought statutory damages based upon the same willful misconduct of Petitioner. But the heart of this case is the concrete harm established at trial.   Being labeled a potential OFAC match is not a misreported ZIP code.   It is the scarlet letter of our time.   It banishes individuals from the marketplace.   It is thus staggering that since 2002 Petitioner could not identify a single correct OFAC match despite issuing thousands of OFAC alerts a year. This is not Lujan or Coffer, not an attempt to constrain other branches, but of honoring the statutory scheme. Thank you, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

More broadly, I would -- I would say that if you look at the mechanics of class certification and the requirement under Rule 23(c) that it be done as early as practicable, at this point, at the point of class certification, it is unlikely that anyone has any idea what the nature of the trial testimony will be. When Petitioner sought 23(f) review in the court of appeals, it did not address the typicality point.   It tried to disqualify Mr. Ramirez not because he was too strong but because he had no claim.   They said that he had dissembled in his application.   They said that he had no damages.   And they tried to disqualify him on summary judgment on the same basis.

Injunctive relief, a party has to establish standing in a more exacting way.   I think that's one of the conclusions of Lujan. It is a -- it makes a difference whether the -- the claim is a facial challenge to a statute or an applied application to the particular claimant.   And, most significantly, I think it makes a difference whether these are generalized claims of the public at large or private claims or private endowment of the right to sue by Congress. So I think that the -- the answer to your question, Justice Kagan, is that Spokeo looks at all of these in the material risk of harm in trying to determine whether there's a sufficient allegation of actual injury. I -- as we said in our brief, it may be better to disaggregate them and to focus primarily on whether these are private versus public rights, because that's a simpler analytic divide that helps explain the outcome in all of this Court's cases.

Good morning, Mr. Issacharoff.   I think you have a good argument with respect to the 1,853 in terms of the reasonable procedures, but I'm more concerned about the 6,332, whose information was not, in essence, published. Under -- in Spokeo, of course, the information was published, which is a big distinction, as I see it, between that case and this, as to the 6,332.   And when Spokeo talked then about risk of harm, it was talking about harm beyond the publication, at least as I understood it, for example, publication of ZIP codes, which strikes me as a very different thing than risk -- talking about risk of harm when there hasn't been publication to begin with.   So that -- that's point one. And then, on -- on risk of harm, you heard me talk about damages versus injunctive relief.   It strikes me that risk of harm, of course, is enough to get you injunctive relief. With damages, I -- I hadn't thought risk of harm would get you damages -- standing for damages claims unless the risk of harm was itself a harm. Judge Tatel in the D.C. Circuit analogized it: If inaccurate information falls into a database, does it make a sound? And his answer to that, applying Stoke -- Spokeo, was no.

But even assuming the burden of publication, if the Court's attention could be directed to Joint Appendix page 104, where TransUnion did an internal audit of its OFAC claims and found that in one month, in July 2012, which is still within the statutory period, within the class period, there were over 17,000 OFAC alerts sent out.

I have a question about whether you can ever have a bare procedural violation with respect to any of these consumer protection statutes, like FCRA or the FDCPA.

So, you know, whether it's to have information put clearly on two pages instead of one or, you know, whether it's to say that certain things must be in writing or whether it's -- I'm thinking of many of the cases that the lower courts have dealt with -- not having so many numbers of your credit card receipt -- credit card number reflected on a receipt, all of these are designed to protect a consumer against the risk of some harm. So is there any violation that you can think of -- and I'm talking about -- I'm not talking about the disclosure here.   I mean I'm not talking about the reasonable procedures claim and the disclosure of private information. I'm talking about these procedural guardrails like this.

I think that the best answer should be that, if it is trivial, if it would not have a common law analogue because of the nature of the disclosure or the nature of the procedural violation, that the Court could reject it as a matter of standing. It remains a question whether the Court is best off handling these as standing matters, meaning that the individual would then be free to file in state court, or should handle it as a matter of part of the injury-in-fact and necessary as part of the statutory standing and then simply rule against the plaintiff on the merits.

The concern in this Court's Article III cases is protecting the domain of Congress. Never has this Court found Article III to remove jurisdiction for retrospective damage claims when Congress has created the private cause of action, vested the affected individuals with the right to bring suit, and then provided for statutory remedy to those individuals. It is difficult to imagine a fact pattern more at the heart of the statutory zone of interest or one that is more uniform across the class.   There are only a total of 6,000 people on the OFAC list, and over 98 percent of them are foreigners. Yet there are 8,185 class members. These are all Americans.   The terrorists or drug kingpins on the OFAC list are not the people who apply for credit at Home Depot. The name match system used here yielded not one Sergio Ramirez in the class of three, not to mention 99 people named Maria Hernandez.   All were listed improperly. Ramirez's claims are not only typical of the other Sergio Ramirezes but are identical to a group put in harm's way by TransUnion's uniform course of conduct. Thank you, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Clement. "}, {"speaker": "Paul D. Clement", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Just a few points in rebuttal. First, on falsity, it's interesting to hear the government to say that reporting this as a potential match is not -- is -- is false because, if you go to the OFAC website today and type in the Respondent's name, you will get a hit.   And so they think it's good enough for the government.   I guess they -- they hold TransUnion to a higher standard. The government also said that the information need not be false for there to be a statutory violation.   And that's actually an important point because, if that's their position, that kind of destroys the analogue between the statutory violation and the common law violation, which is a point Justice Scalia made at argument in the Spokeo argument. If I can move now to standing, on standing, I think that Respondent's counsel correctly answered the Chief Justice's hypo at least under Respondent's view that a material risk is enough under Spokeo. But, if a material risk is enough and the answer to the Chief Justice's hypo is that's right, everybody can bring actions for traffic violations that didn't actually realize themselves in any harm, I mean, the Article III courts could be open to all sorts of trivial injuries where everybody should be essentially toasting their good luck, not suing the person who posed a risk to them but didn't actually injure them. Another point on standing, I think it is worth recognizing why this issue is so important, is there are people in our system of government who do get to pursue violations of federal statutes without suffering injuries-in-fact.   They are called prosecutors. But, if you're going to give a cause of action to an individual under our system, they can only actually bring that claim into federal court if they have suffered injury-in-fact. On typicality, I want to make two points about that.   First is typicality is required at the outset of the case because the class representatives, typicality is important from the beginning.   It's not just a trial issue.   The -- the -- the defense has the right to depose the class representative.   So, from the very beginning of the case, the class representative is essentially the embodiment of the case. It is true, I -- I suppose, as a technical matter that the class representative doesn't have to testify, but, in practice, they do.   And that's why having a typical -- an atypical class representative is a bad idea from the beginning. The antitrust cases are different, Justice Breyer, and they are different in an important way, because it starts with the predominance question at the beginning of certification. In an antitrust case or a securities case, people will say, well, the individualized issues are -- of damages will predominate. People will say, no, we can deal with it with some kind of claim processing issue.   And then the damages issue isn't that important. But, in a statutory damages case, particularly one seeking punitives, at the predominance issue, what the plaintiffs say is, don't worry, we have one-size-fits-all statutory and punitive damages here.   And then, they turn around and say, we're going to find the least typical class representative we can.   That's an abuse.   That's an abuse this Court has to stop. The other point I would make about this -- and this is really where the standing and the typicality arguments come together -- is, if it really is going to be the case that you can have standing just by suffering a material risk and you don't actually have to have the injury realized, then having somebody who suffered a real injury risk and had it materialize on them is a very atypical class representative for a class of people who only suffered a material risk.
