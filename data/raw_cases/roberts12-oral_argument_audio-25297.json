[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case Number 19-1257, Brnovich versus Democratic National Committee, and the consolidated case. Mr. Carvin. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the key conceptual point here to understand is that Arizona has not denied anyone any voting opportunity of any kind. There's not, like, a literacy test which denies you the right to vote.   It's not like vote dilution, where white bloc voting denies minorities an equal opportunity to elect. Everyone here is eligible and registered to vote.   All they have to do is utilize the myriad opportunities that Arizona's offered them over 27 days to vote by mail for free or in person. And since there's no denial of opportunities, this is a disparate impact claim that would not even be cognizable in other contexts.   Under Title VII, disparate impact relates to a denial of an employment opportunity, a job or a promotion.   It doesn't get involved in the process.   No one's ever brought a Title VII claim saying you can't require people to send in applications because minorities have less access to transportation and mail, analogous to the claim being made here. So Respondents are trying to move disparate impact into an entirely different context.   Since there's no denial of any voting opportunity in this context, the circumstances in which time, place, and manner rules can violate Section 2 are extraordinarily limited. They only occur if the state has organized the time, place, and manner rules and stacked them in such a way that minorities have less opportunity than non-minorities to cast their vote. That comes directly from the plain language of Section 2, and it's also, of course, as a practical matter, the only circumstance in which the state has erected any kind of cognizable barrier to minority voting. Respondents' alternative view is at war with the text of Section 2.   Section 2 says, again, voting practices cannot provide less opportunity.   They say that voting practices which provide the same opportunity are nonetheless unlawful if external socioeconomic factors somehow contribute to disproportionate utilization.   But that language is nowhere in the text and was never even mentioned in the legislative history, which is quite -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- notable -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- Mr. Carvin, as I understand your test as you've just articulated it, it reduces to -- anything dealing with time, place, or manner, it's an -- an intent test rather than a results test that's provided under Section 2. In other words, so long as it's a time, place, or manner restriction, it's only when there's a difference and it's between minority voters and white voters that you have a problem.   Is that not true? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Not entirely, Mr. Chief Justice, for this reason: It does involve differential systems, unequal access, but regardless of whether or not that unequal access is racially motivated, you would not have to prove that the intent behind the differential access provided to minorities was to suppress or hinder the minority vote.   And that's a key distinction from Mobile versus Bolden. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You -- you talk about the concern being that the analysis would be driven to racial proportionality under the Respondents' approach. Now I understand the concerns about that when you're talking about districting, but why is that -- why is that a bad thing when you're talking about electoral procedures? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well, what it means is that any neutral system must be changed in order to maximize minority voting strength regardless of how strong the justification is. Things that provide no unfairness at all to minorities, you must rejigger every aspect of the time, place, and manner, from registration, to Election Day, to early voting, in order to maximize minorities' participation. Why is that bad? Because it's the same kind of race-conscious activity of subordinating -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, is it -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- neutral principles -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- is it really -- is it maximizing participation or -- or equalizing it? In other words, that only comes up when you have disparate results. And -- and why should there be disparate results if -- if -- if you can avoid them? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Because why should you -- well, for example, because it would eliminate all the valuable antifraud concerns implicated in the ban on ballot harvesting and because it would substitute the federal courts, the state legislatures to make these rules. The question is not what's wrong with it.   The question is why a system that imposes no unfairness on the group should nonetheless be changed simply because they find a different method of voting more convenient. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " There's no reason to -- there's no reason to say -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Just -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- that simply because -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Thomas. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Carvin, I -- I under -- your -- I understand your race neutrality argument, and normally you see that in -- to come in -- in -- in the context of a non-discrimination statute or Fourteenth Amendment that under -- that really requires equal treatment. How does that race neutrality approach fit within the language of the Voting Rights Act, though, that doesn't speak in -- in those terms? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well, Justice Thomas, I think it speaks precisely in those terms.   It says that a voting practice cannot result in minorities having less opportunity than non-minorities.   It says the system needs to be equally open.   So what it's saying is as long as everyone has the same opportunity and the system is equally open, Section 2 does not condemn it. The Respondents, however, would say that even if minorities are given precisely the same opportunity, unless they utilize it proportionally, then somehow that comes within the constraints of Section 2. But, again, there's nothing in the text of Section 2 which says you need to expand time, place, and manner restrictions to enhance proportionality or maximization. Indeed, if that had been the rule, in 1982, virtually every time, place, and manner restriction in the country would have been illegal overnight because there was severe disproportionate utilization and socioeconomic disparities were ubiquitous.   And surely, if Congress had intended that kind of sea change, it would have given some hint of it in the legislative history. So this rule is both contrary to the text of Section 2 and any other formulation of what Congress was intending. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " So is there a causation standard implicit in your neutrality argument? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Only in the sense that result, obviously, connotes causation, right? And the question is: what is the prohibited -- what can you not cause? What is the prohibited result? And the plain language of Section 2 tells you what the system can't result in is providing less opportunity to minorities.   It doesn't say it can't result in providing them the same opportunity, but, for whatever reason, they don't utilize it to the same extent. So there is a causation question, but the question is what can the state not cause. We say it can't cause less opportunity.   The other side says it can't do anything that results in disproportionate outcomes. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " And how much less opportunity? The Ninth Circuit speaks in terms of de minimis language.   Does that -- and then the -- of course, Justice -- Judge Scan -- O'Scannlain talks more in the language of substantial. What -- what -- what -- how much less opportunity? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well, again, it depends what you're talking about, Justice Thomas.   If you're talking about disproportionate outcomes, we don't think that's the issue.   So we don't think a severely disproportionate outcome jeopardizes Section 2 viability, nor does a minor disproportionate outcome. The question is not the outcome.   The question is the opportunity and if the state has provided everyone the same opportunity. Now I will agree with the attorney general, however, if you get past that, then, obviously, there needs to be something substantial for two reasons.   No one requires perfect, of course -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well -- I'm out of time.   I'm sorry to cut you off, Mr. Carvin. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " I apologize.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I have two questions. One question is a literacy test.   Does that provide people the same opportunity? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I thought that. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " By definition, a literacy test -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " A literacy test doesn't.   And so how do we know whether the test -- the -- the OOP and the other -- whether they do or they don't? I didn't think -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well, I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- there's an obvious distinction. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " I apologize.   No, I think there's an -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I just thought that it was a measure, a way of finding out if it's the same opportunity or not to see if minority people use it equally. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " No, it -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If they don't use it equally, well, it doesn't prove it, but it might be, but the rule that prevents them from using it equally results in an abridgement on account of race. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Right.   And that's the key point.   A literacy test denies you the opportunity to vote, says you can't vote.   Go to the polls, they won't let you vote. Nothing like that is going on here. Everyone has a complete opportunity to vote. The state has not erected any barrier.   If the state denies you an opportunity like, under Title VII, it denies -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, I've got that point. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- you a job -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I've got that point, but I have another -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- then you ask your -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah.   I have another, more -- I think a more important question.   What would you think of Professor Stephanopoulos's tests, basically, or standards which bring in from Title VI, Title VII, The Housing Act, the -- the ADA, you know, it uses roughly the same approach and there would be an opportunity for the state to say we have a good non-race-related reason for doing this. And, therefore, whatever result is, fewer -- fewer minorities use it, but it's not on account of race, it's on account of our good reason.   Now that's what we have in all these other statutes, something like that. What would you think of just taking forms of those rules and using them here? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Yes.   Well, two points. One is, of course, there's nothing in the language of Section 2 which allows you to justify a discriminatory result based on the strength of -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What about the words \"on account of race\"? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Right.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If the reason you are doing it is because you have the most wonderful non-race-related reason in the world for doing this, then it is not on account of race. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Right.   \"On account of race,\" as you know, generally and under Gingles means because of race.   And the results test means it doesn't have to be on account of intentional discrimination. In terms of reading in a justification, obviously, that would make it -- make their proportionality mandate somewhat less inflexible.   But, again, even if you could read it into the statute, you would nonetheless be subjecting the policy judgments of state legislatures to some ad hoc determinations of the sort that was engaged in by the en banc court, where they can find simple things like out-of-precinct voting and ballot harvesting bans to somehow be unjustified. And even under the totality of circumstances in vote dilution, the tenuousness of the policy is only the ninth of the factors. And so I don't understand why, if the statute had actually prohibited, as Respondents said, any kind of disparate outcomes, why -- why we would allow the state to get away with that. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " But I will fully embrace the notion that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Carvin, you argue that one benchmark for evaluating whether members of a protected class have less opportunity to participate is what we refer to in Crawford as \"the usual burdens of voting.\" What does that mean? What are the -- "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- \"usual burdens of voting\"? Are they the burdens as they existed in 1982? Do they change? How do we determine what they are? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " I -- I think what they mean is what the Court meant in Crawford, which is what we all understand to be the usual burdens of voting. You make a very good point about 1982. We know that needs to be the benchmark for the usual burdens because, otherwise, that meant Congress in 1982 was invalidating virtually every time, place, and manner restriction.   So that needs to be, if you will, the safe harbor. The only point we're making is Section 2 did not immunize minorities from the usual burdens of voting.   It didn't say, you -- you don't have to show up at the right precinct and those sorts of things.   And there's nothing in the language of Section 2 which somehow exempts them from doing so. So, as long as it's roughly commensurate with the normal Election Day system that exists, that would constitute the usual burden of voting. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Now this relates to what you were just discussing with Justice Breyer.   Your approach differs a bit from that of the attorney general and the Solicitor General's brief in that I don't understand you to argue that a -- a consideration of the strength of the state's interests for a voting practice has a role to play here. Is that a correct understanding of your position? And if so, why isn't that a -- a legitimate consideration? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Your Honor, I would love it if the state could justify its systems if you're going to impose on them some kind of proportionality mandate.   Our basic point is it's not a proportionality mandate and their justification should not be an affirmative defense to that.   If you want to read that into the statute, that would make it better than a straight proportionality mandate. I will emphasize again that even under Houston Lawyers' Association, which the Solicitor General puts forward, the justification is merely one factor out of the nine to be considered.   So that means you're now into this amorphous nine Senate report factors where every district court and appellate court can do its own kind of balancing test, which will lead to all sorts of ad hoc results and not give you the kind of clarity and guidance that state legislatures need prior to Election Day.

Is that system equally open in the language of the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " I would say not. \"Equally open\" means takes into account demographic realities.

A state has long had two weeks of early voting, and then the state decides that it's going to get rid of Sunday voting on those two weeks, leave everything else in place.

What is the relationship between your test focused on opportunities and the test that the Solicitor General's brief at least suggested about causation and the need for maybe a proximate causation test? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Yeah, I -- at the end of the day, I don't know that there's really any difference.   They -- they taught -- their first step is, do minorities have the ability to vote? And they say that's synonymous with equal opportunity.   So I think we're on the same page there. They also say, if socioeconomic factors lead to underutilization by minorities, that's not a cognizable factor under Section 2 because it's got to be the voting practice that causes the diminished opportunity.   Again, we are in full-throated agreement with that provision as well. So the two key points are the system itself needs to provide less opportunity to voters, and if socioeconomic factors, which are external to the voting practice, lead to diminished utilization, under neither our test nor the Solicitor's general test would there be a problem under Section 2. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Do you -- is there anything in the Solicitor General's brief that you disagree with? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " I don't know why they use the word \"ability\" instead of \"opportunity,\" because one's in the statute and one's not, but other than that semantic quibble, no. We've also talked about reading justification into the statute, a result which I warmly embrace.   We may be a tad more skeptical about whether that flows from the statutory language than the Solicitor General was. But, no, we have no real disagreements with the Solicitor General -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " -- the one that was withdrawn. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " All right.   And then the other question Justice Thomas touched on that I want to dig down a little bit further on is you speak of equality of opportunity. Does that permit any de minimis distinctions, or does it require equality of opportunity under all circumstances? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Right, yes.   Obviously, any -- any of these phrases need to take into account the sort of demographic realities, for example, that Justice Kagan was discussing, and if a polling place was a foot farther away for minorities than for non-minorities, I don't think anybody could argue that that really has a cognizable effect on opportunity. So, sure, in all of these tests, there's some kind of basic common-sense definition. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   And then, to add one more hypothetical to this -- well, maybe I'll just stop there.   Thank you, Mr. Carvin. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Carvin.   Your brief says, \"Ordinary race-neutral regulations of the time, place, and manner of voting do not violate Section 2.\" And that, of course, will put a lot of pressure on the word \"ordinary.\" Can you tell us how courts are supposed to distinguish ordinary regulations from extraordinary regulations? "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Well, I -- I think the way the Court has done it countless times in the Anderson/Burdick line of cases and in Crawford, what are the usual burdens of voting? This is not some mystery.   We have a long history of about how people go about voting.   They show up at precincts and they cast a ballot.   That requires you to leave your house, but that's not an ordinary burden of voting -- that's a usual burden of voting. Whereas the other side says, you can never have a system which requires anybody to leave their house.   They claim that they can't find the precincts because of socioeconomic disparities.   They claim that they can't get to mailboxes because of socioeconomic disparities, which means that the state needs to allow partisan operatives to go collect the ballots. Well, if that's true, of course, that means that the only system that would satisfy their test is something where the government is sent to house to house to collect the ballots. And I'm just saying that that can't come with any rational definition of the usual burdens of voting, which is you register and you go cast your ballot.   And that is not a very difficult burden, and it's certainly not a difficult burden here when 99.8 percent of minorities were able to find the right precinct. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

My reason is simply this: It seems to me that in many discrimination statutes -- anti-discrimination, Title VII, Title VI, the Housing Act, the age discrimination -- essentially, the courts have come down in disparate impact situations to three elements. First, the plaintiff has to show that there is some kind of significant disparity. Second, the plaintiff has to show that there is at least a but-for cause and the states of the employer's policy is the but-for cause. And then, third, the defendant can come back and show, well, we have a good non-race-related reason for this and it can't be accomplished easily in other ways. Those three elements run through the law.   Many of the tests, and Stephanopoulos, who says it explicitly, embody those three elements.

Once again, I believe that any -- analyzing any of these burdens on voters or if there's statistical disparities, we have to look at the totality of the circumstances and a totality of the voting systems within that state.

She says in response to your argument that we have to look at the process itself to say, overall, is the process, you know, open enough for disadvantaged voters.   So, you know, even if they can't send their ballot in via ballot collection, they have many other opportunities to do so, early voting, et cetera. She points out in Footnote 6 on page 23 that \"[i]f a state sends unsolicited ballot applications to residents of white neighborhoods but not to residents of black neighborhoods, that would amount to giving the latter less 'opportunity' to participate.\" And she's, you know, quoting the Republican Party there.

Arizona endorses without qualification the Voting Rights Act goal of ending racial discrimination in voting.   The Constitution demands that all Americans be free from this pernicious evil. A disparate impact on minority voters can be an appropriate proxy for legal discrimination when that disparity is substantial.   But, without these showings, Section 2 would exceed Congress's powers to enforce the Reconstruction amendments, improperly inject race into all voting laws, and impede a state's ability to run their elections. Arizona's requirement that ballots be cast at assigned local precincts and its restrictions on ballot harvesting are appropriate election integrity measures that do not create any disparate impact on racial minorities but serve us all equally well. The desire to enhance the convenience of voting must never outweigh the imperative of securing the integrity of the result.

Amunson", "text": " Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When an eligible voter casts a ballot and that ballot is discarded rather than counted, that voter has been denied the right to vote.   Likewise, when an eligible voter relies on ballot collection to vote and that practice is criminalized, that citizen's vote to right has at the very least been abridged. The question then is whether that denial or abridgement has occurred on account of race.   Section 2's plain text tells courts how to answer that question, and the statutory command to answer based on the totality of circumstances necessarily requires rejection of the inflexible rules Petitioners advocate. To the contrary, it mandates what this Court has called a searching, practical evaluation of the past and present reality and a functional view of the political process. Petitioners have caricatured the Section 2 results test as resting on bare statistical disparities that will call into question every election regulation in the country.   Not true. Section 2's results test has been in place for almost 40 years, and nothing like what Petitioners claim has come to pass.   Indeed, successful Section 2 challenges to statewide election laws involving voter ID, early voting, ballot collection, and out-of-precinct voting number in the single digits. Section 2 liability has been limited to policies that, due to their interaction with particular facts on the ground, are outliers in the discriminatory burden that they impose on minority voters.   That is the case here. As Arizona's chief elections officer, Secretary of State Hobbs knows that the out-of-precinct policy and the ballot collection statute impose discriminatory burdens on Native American, Latino, and black voters that are not justified by any legitimate state interest.

What do you think of, since disparate impact is -- this is not the only field in which it comes up, that we take the standards from the other areas -- employment, age, and housing and so forth -- and simply say they're roughly the same here? The statute does speak on account of race, which means if it's justified, it's not on account of race, all right? So we simply take those standards, producing a uniformity in the law.   That's my general question. My specific question is, what do you really say about the question that I think Justice Thomas was asking, that if you win in the details here, in many -- in the majority of states, they won't be able to engage in precinct voting, because a lot of the precincts will turn out to be maybe 10 feet or maybe 100 yards or maybe 1,000 yards on -- in general further away from a minority group of houses than a majority group of houses.   Are you supposed to go out with a tape measure? What? All right.   That's a concern in the specific case. So I'm interested in both.   One, what's your general view of using roughly the same standards, and, two, what about that specific case? "}, {"speaker": "Jessica R. Amunson", "text": " First, Your Honor, as to the -- the disparate impact standard, we think that is -- those elements are already incorporated in the test that the court applied below, and our only quibble with the -- with the standard that Your Honor set forth is the requirement of a \"significant disparity.\" We don't think that simply importing a textual adjective like \"significant\" or \"substantial\" really moves the ball.   That said, we do recognize that you have to -- that the size of a disparity will matter for purposes of being able to prove whether a policy is, in fact, discriminatory on account of race. As to Your Honor's second question about whether states can engage in -- still engage in precinct-based voting, certainly, Your Honor, states maintain plenty of discretion and authority to regulate their elections as they see fit and to have precinct-based voting systems. The reality is that is actually not -- not what is happening in Arizona.   In fact, in 2020, 75 percent of voters voted in counties that do not actually use precinct-based systems. And so, while there may be some interest in maintaining precinct-based systems in other states, that is not actually the reality on the ground in Arizona.   We don't think the states need to take out tape -- tape measures.   Instead, what they have to do is ensure that they are not providing less opportunity to minorities.

He even said, you know, it would be laughable not to look at demographic realities on occasion. And I bring you back to this hypothetical question where black voters have many fewer polling stations, even though that's a completely neutral rule on its face, but the way it operates is to make voting more difficult for black voters than white voters and leave it so that they -- the political system is not equally open to their participation.

So, I mean, tell me how you think these things differ.   And I guess, more specifically -- I guess, when you start thinking about a whole run of hypotheticals, there are some things that are really quite obvious burdens which you just know looking at them is going to lead to -- to real difficulty for some -- you know, to black -- for black voters or for Native American voters or for Latino voters, and then other restrictions where you can say, well, you know, that's kind of an inconvenience, but they could -- they could overcome that inconvenience if -- if they really wanted to.

And so, Your Honor, as to the kind of spectrum of regulations, that's exactly what Section 2 is meant for courts to do, to undertake a functional inquiry into the totality of the circumstances. What I took Mr. Carvin's brief to be saying, as opposed to what Mr. Carvin argued here today, is that, in fact, so-called neutral time, place, and manner regulations don't even implicate Section 2.   That is, you don't even get to get past the pleading stage if you come in with -- and say this is simply a -- a neutral time, place, and manner restriction. Instead, what courts should be doing is looking at how that restriction interacts with the facts on the ground to see whether it is, in fact, causing a discriminatory burden on minority voters.

And good morning, Ms. Amunson.   I want to explore how we got here as a statutory matter and try to square up the statutory text and common sense a bit.   It seems like there are two polar positions one could have reading different parts of the statute. So Section 2(a) speaks only of results.   That was the House bill, of course. And that strongly supports a position that any disproportionate impact would be problematic under the statute.   Of course, the Dole compromise meant that Section 2(b) was added to the statute, and that speaks of opportunity. And a polar position on that would be, as was suggested in Mr. Carvin's brief, that time, place, and manner restrictions that are race-neutral provide equal opportunity. But, as Justice Kagan pointed out, just -- Mr. Carvin alluded to demographic realities being relevant, the state attorney general also talked about the totality of the circumstances being relevant, and, of course, in Section 2(b) -- refers to the totality of the circumstances. So, to the extent we're not at either polar position, we're between pure results and pure opportunity, as defined in -- in Mr. Carvin's brief at least, and we're in totality of the circumstances, two -- two circumstances that seem to make a difference as a matter of common sense.   One, as the Chief Justice pointed out, when you have the Carter-Baker Commission saying that a particular state law is a good idea as a matter of policy, that would seem to be a circumstance that is -- as a matter of common sense, would -- would lend support to the state's rule. And then, secondly, and I mentioned this earlier, when a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent. And, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in something like 26 other states, including a wide variety of states, including states with no history of discrimination. So, if we get into totality of the circumstances, why don't those two things matter? And you can comment more generally on how I've outlined this. "}, {"speaker": "Jessica R. Amunson", "text": " Thank you, Your Honor. Taking both policies in turn, it certainly is relevant that policies are commonplace.   However, it doesn't give a state a free pass just by saying this is a common policy.   Instead, you have to look at whether, in fact, the policy is justified in that state. And so, for example, with the out-of-precinct policy, the state justifies it by saying that it needs to maintain a precinct-based system. But the reality in Arizona is that 75 percent of voters in the 2020 election voted in counties that do not use a precinct-based system.   And so that should cause a court to question whether, in fact, such a policy is actually necessary or is, in fact, doing something else which is disenfranchising minority voters. Second, with respect to the ballot collection statute, again, Arizona had a 25-year history of literally not a single instance of fraud with ballot collection.

And there's a difficulty that, you know, the statutory language and its lack of clarity presents in trying to figure out when something crosses from an inconvenience to a burden. You know, on the other side -- and I think some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito was asking you emphasized this -- I think, you know, your position and its emphasis on any disparity at all risks saying that any election rule, you know, which, as Judge Easterbrook pointed out in his Frank opinion, you know, all election rules are going to make it easier for some to vote than others. So your approach risks ruling them all out.   So let me give you an example.   What about a rule that the polls close at 7 p.m. and because of socioeconomic reasons, it's harder for minority voters to get to the poll spot before 7 p.m. because of the time, you know, of their work hours in the day?

As this Court has repeatedly said, no right is more precious in a democracy than the right to vote and to have that vote counted. That is what Section 2 protects.

Candidates and parties should be trying to win over voters on the basis of their ideas, not trying to remove voters from the electorate by imposing unjustified and discriminatory burdens. Unfortunately, Petitioners have made clear that that is not their vision of democracy.   Indeed, Mr. Carvin's clients frankly admitted to this Court in their briefing that they are here because they view enforcement of the Voting Rights Act as a \"injury to their electoral prospects.\" Secretary Hobbs submits that the real injury here is to the Native American, Latino, and black citizens of Arizona whose right to vote has been denied or abridged by the out-of-precinct policy and the criminalization of neighbors helping neighbors deliver their ballots.

The test is rooted in the plain text of Section 2, clear congressional intent, and this Court's long-standing precedents.

This Court said in Shelby County that Section 2 remained as a permanent nationwide ban on voting discrimination, and the Court acknowledged that voting discrimination still exists.   No one doubts this. This is proven not just an accurate description of the times in 2013 but also prophetic.   More voting restrictions have been enacted over the last decade than at any point since the end of Jim Crow. The last three months have seen an even greater uptick in proposed voting restrictions, many aimed squarely at the minority groups whose participation Congress intended to protect. Rigorous and fair enforcement of Section 2 is as critical to the protection of minority voting rights today as it was when Congress passed the 1982 amendment.   The test used by the majority of circuits has not undermined a large swath of neutral voting restrictions.   Rather, it has been used to carefully review and, where necessary, strike down discriminatory voting laws. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Carvin, rebuttal. "}, {"speaker": "Michael A. Carvin", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the colloquy makes clear that we're the only people who are providing a clear rule that can be applied by the lower courts. To clarify, any ambiguity in this, both at argument and in our brief, we've been making the same argument.   Does the voting system provide different opportunities to minorities than it does to non-minorities? Has the voting system stacked the deck to favor non-minorities? If it hasn't, if it doesn't treat minority neighborhoods differently than non-minority neighborhoods, then there's no problem.   If it does, that's what gets at it. Now figuring out whether there's this kind of differential treatment, you need to look at population or, stated differently, demographic reality.   One precinct with five people in it is quite different than one polling place with 5,000 people in it because the latter has much less opportunity. But, if there's no differential treatment of that kind, socioeconomic factors, contribution to minorities' ability to utilize that same opportunity is irrelevant. Finally, I want to get back to the colloquy that Justice Alito was having with Mr. Spiva.   Given the ubiquity of socioeconomic disparities, this would clearly put states in a straightjacket.   This case brilliantly illustrates that. They claim that there's a lot of problem for minorities to get to precincts relative to non-minorities.   What does Arizona do? Has this free mail system for 27 days that's utilized by 80 percent of the people, the very system that the DNC went around the country advocating as an expansion of the franchise. Now we're told that a mail system somehow discriminates against minorities, which is completely untrue under the facts.   But the only fact you need to know is anybody whose ballot is harvested received the ballot through the mail.   This is all people who have already got the ballots, and they're picked up after they're voted. Well, how did they get the ballots? They received them through the mail.   So, for that reason, the district court was quite correct to hold that there's no connection between access to mail and the need for ballot harvesting.   They couldn't produce a single voter who said it was more difficult to vote without ballot harvesting. Same thing in terms of precincts.   The notion that socioeconomic disparities make it difficult to find a precinct has nothing to do with this case because everybody involved here found a precinct.   They simply found the wrong precinct.   So transportation and work schedules had no inhibiting effect on minorities. And, finally, of course, they didn't challenge the arrangement of precincts.   The Court found at Joint Appendix 336 precincts are no harder to find.
