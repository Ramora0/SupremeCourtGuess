[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-166, RadLAX Gateway Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank.   Mr. Neff. "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The question presented in this case is whether a secured creditor must be allowed to credit bid when its collateral is being sold under a chapter 11 plan.   The relevant section of the Bankruptcy Code plainly says no.   Section 1129(b)(2)(A) provides that a chapter 11 plan must be fair and equitable to a secured creditor that objects to it.   It then provides three alternatives that the debtor can pursue to satisfy that test.   Any one of these three alternatives can be used when assets are being sold, but only one of them requires the right to credit bid.   Under subsection (i), the plan must allow the creditor to retain its lien and receive payments over time, with the present value equal to the value of its collateral.   Under subsection (ii), the plan must allow the creditor to credit bid when its asset is being sold free of its lien.   But under subsection (iii), the plan must provide the creditor with the indubitable equivalent of its secured claim.   The debtors have chosen to pursue a plan, a plan sale without credit bidding under subsection (iii).   The plain language of the statute permits that result. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But how does one determine what is the indubitable equivalent of the creditor's claim? "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " The indubitable equivalent will be determined at the time of plan confirmation, in our case after the sale has been conducted although not yet approved by the court.   So the court will have-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The sale -- something -- the sale can't go on without the court's approval.   I mean, the auction has to have the court's approval, right? "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " --Well, here's what happens typically.   The debtor files a motion, as we did in this case, to approve bid procedures.   The court then determines whether those bid procedures are appropriate for the sale.   The sale is then conducted.   Then the debtor goes to plan confirmation; and, at the plan confirmation hearing, aside from establishing the 16 requirements of section 1129 for a plan to be confirmed, the debtor also seeks to confirm the results of the sale. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And so what qualifies as indubitably equivalent? "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " The indubitable equivalent must be an amount that is at least equal to the amount of the secured claim.   In essence, it's going to be determined by what the asset's sold for, provided that the sale has generated the best possible price for the asset.

Neff", "text": " The creditor has an opportunity at the plan confirmation hearing to raise any issue with regard to the sale process, with regard to the auction that occurred, has the opportunity to raise any other issue that may bear on the price that is received at the sale that occurs.   For instance, it could say, well, they conducted this auction, but I have an appraisal here that says the property is worth much more.   So this can't possibly be -- my-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, isn't the -- isn't the issue who is going to decide whether something is really the indubitable equivalent?

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if the Respondent thought that what the judge would determine would indubitably provide the indubitable equivalent, then there wouldn't be an issue here, right?

Neff", "text": " In this particular instance, I would suggest that the -- the creditor simply does not want the asset sold.   It would rather take the asset back and hold it for some time period.

And that's exactly what we propose to do under our sale procedure. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Neff", "text": " Well, with regard to the indubitable equivalent, clearly the judge is going to make that determination, but that's no different than the judge making a determination under subsection (i) as to what the fair market value of the collateral is for purposes of determining the note that the creditor is going to receive and be paid off over time. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Could the -- could the judge say when the proposal is made to him, the only way I can be sure that it is the indubitable equivalent is to have the sale open to credit bidding, which is what we always do?

Neff", "text": " If there is testimony provided to the judge that that is the way that will maximize the sale proceeds and that in fact you can't get indubitable equivalence unless you allow credit bidding, it would seem to me under that circumstance the judge would have that discretion.

"}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " --Your Honor, I would disagree.   I think in a situation like ours, no one else is going to come to bid, because creditors who are -- or potential purchasers who are looking to buy a hotel have multiple opportunities to buy other hotels.   So if they know that they are going to show up at a sale where a creditor is owed substantially in excess of what the property is likely to sell for, they are not going to spend their time and effort doing the due diligence that is required to acquire or make a bid on an asset like a hotel. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What's wrong with that?   I mean, a creditor loaned you a million dollars.   For the million dollars, he got an interest, a secured interest in a piece of property.   And that property is worth whatever it was -- whatever it's worth, less than a million.   And he says that's the deal.   I -- I have a secured interest in this; I want the property.   You are better off because you can stretch out the payments over time and maybe you don't have to give it to him immediately, but I don't see anything unfair about saying, give him the property if he wants it.

I mean, as I read it, to put it out on the table, this makes perfect sense.   What they are trying to do is help the debtor a little without mucking up the secured creditor's collateral.   Choice (i) gives the secured creditor his collateral, and there is still a lien on it.   He has what he had before, and the debtor is better off because he can stretch the payments out over time, and that's one and two.   Choice (ii), we give the creditor some new collateral.   Hmm, that's a little risky, but to be sure it's fair, we are absolutely certain, with a few exceptions not relevant, that the creditor can credit bid.   So he has it within his control.   Choice (iii), something else which comes up in different situations, for example, a creditor who is over-secured, see, and they want to sell the piece of property.   And he says, sure, I will let you sell it, but I want something that's the equivalent.   Give me this other property over here that you own that has no liens at all.   And the judge can look at that and say that's fair.   That's what (iii) is basically about, as far as I could understand it.   So it all makes sense to me, and I don't understand why you would want to have a rule saying that (iii) trumps (i) and (ii) and stops credit bidding. "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " --Your Honor-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So that's the whole thing as I am seeing it at this moment.   So I'll give you a chance to reply.

Your Honor, I don't see subsection (iii) as having the limiting language that it should have if in fact it was meant to be something other than what is in subsection (i) or subsection (ii).

I mean, your brief suggests that somehow there are these unsecured creditors in the mix who are going to receive some benefit if your understanding of this statute goes forward.

What you want to do under (iii) is precisely what (ii) says, except you want to eliminate subject to section 363(k) of this title.   Right?   Does it -- does it make sense for a provision to say you can do it three ways: number (i), number (ii), you can have this sale subject to credit bidding, and number (iii), after -- after saying that, specifically, oh, you can have this sale not subject to credit bidding?   That's not a very sensible statute.   Why go through that -- that problem of -- of saying number (ii), if you could have left it to number (iii) anyway? "}, {"speaker": "David M.

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But that's just not true from what you just said.   Meaning what you just said is that the buyer obviously is paying other things off, and by definition he's deducting that from the purchase price.   No one gives a purchase price for a piece of property and agrees to pay something else and gives the highest price for the property once they've done that.   So what you're asking for is permission for the debtor to use this property to pay other debts, and that's what I thought a secured interest prevented. "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " With regard to Justice Scalia's question, all I was trying to point out is that in subsection (ii), regardless of the price that is achieved as long as you allow the secured creditor the right to credit bid.

Neff", "text": " Section allows the sale of property outside the ordinary course of business during a bankruptcy case.   It can be done as quickly as on 21 days notice, so it can be done on a very truncated basis, or even more quickly if the debtor can show that there is cause, some reason to have an even faster sale.   There is no requirement that you show that any of the plan requirements in section 1129 must be met.   So there are good reasons to have this protection for the secured creditor when you are selling under section 363 outside of a plan context that don't necessarily exist when you are selling in the course of a plan because a plan takes a much longer time period, usually at least 2 months notice, if not much longer. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Mr. Neff, don't you feel sorry for the United States?   The United States is often in the creditor situation, and the United States cannot come up with cash.   Are they going to run to Congress and get an appropriation for each -- each security case it has?   What -- what do you propose we do with the United States?   The United States just can't take any security interests anymore or what? "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " Well, no, I don't think that that is the case.   And I did see that in their brief, and I don't know the extent that in practice that actually occurs because, for instance, they pointed out the SBA loans, those are typically guaranteed loans.   So there would be a motivation, at least by the principals of the debtor, to maximize the return to the SBA.   But as far as them not being allowed to credit bid, there are -- they have the opportunity to have a greater voice in the sale process.   They can seek-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I don't understand. "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " --Well, they can seek from the Bankruptcy Court a greater role when the asset is being marketed for sale to ensure that they are receiving top dollar on their claim. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They don't have that right now? "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " Well, when we sell assets the debtor typically has the control over how it's going to be marketed and sold.   They may give some input rights to the secured creditor, but they're usually not going to give the secured creditor the veto power over how to conduct the sale.   But I would suggest that when you have a situation with a creditor that truly cannot bid cash, that there would be an opportunity to impress upon the judge that they need to have a greater role when you are actually marketing and selling the property. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Neff, can I understand how your system would actually work in practice?   Suppose you have an auction and there is the top value was $500, and then you have the secured creditor let's say is in the position of the United States and comes in and says: We couldn't credit bid, but we -- excuse me -- we couldn't pay cash, but we think it's $750. "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And now the court has to decide whether it's $500 or $750 after the auction has gone forward.   What happens? "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " The court is going to review the process to actually sell the asset, who was -- where was it marketed, who knew about it, who showed up at the auction, how many bids were made. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, now let's say the court says: You know, I think that the government is right; it's really $750.   But you've already had a sale.

The closing doesn't occur until the plan confirmation actually occurs.   And, in fact, that's how you would do it after this Court's ruling in 2008. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But wouldn't the court always say, when it's confronted with this situation, the government comes in and the court says, yes, well, you know, I guess that that price is probably so low because nobody could credit bid.   Wouldn't that always be a -- a frailty of whatever -- whatever price it sold for?   Wouldn't it always be? "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " No, because you are going to have situations where creditors -- secured creditors will credit bid amounts that have no relationship to the fair market value, what we call, for instance, loan-to-own lenders, where their only interest is actually getting the title to the property.   So you are going to have situations that -- where the credit bid does not equate to market-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, that might be, but it doesn't -- it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you allow people to bid for cash or for credit, you are going to get more bids and higher bids than if you allow them to bid for cash only. "}, {"speaker": "David M. Neff", "text": " --The problem is when you are dealing with larger assets, like what we are dealing with, you are not going to get a sophisticated buyer to come in to bid against a lender that can credit bid, particularly in a situation like our case, where the lender has said: I simply want the property back.

Bidders who would bid more than what the creditor thinks it's worth, the creditor will want them in this, and if he doesn't want it in, it's because he thinks it's worth more in his own hands.   So what's the problem?   But there is a problem the other way.   The problem the other way, and I'm not saying it's this case, but there are -- is that the insiders say to the stalking horse: We would like you to put this up at a low price and give us a job.   And if they keep the creditor out, well, that's a big incentive.   And they are the ones who know what a hotel is worth.   The judge doesn't know, and there is always leeway.

You agree to pay the stalking horse a million and a half dollars in case he doesn't get it.   And then the people from the inside are being hired by the stalking horse if he wins.   Now, I'm not -- I'm sure they are acting very honestly, but you would have to say in such a situation that there is an incentive to try to value everything on the low side by the debtor to make sure that stalking horse gets the property.

When a chapter 11 bankruptcy plan is going to cram down a plan over the objection of a secured creditor, section 1129(b)(2)(A) gives the secured creditor the ability to protect those rights regardless of the proposed treatment of its collateral.   Specifically, when the plan proposes, as here, to sell the collateral free and clear of the secured creditor's liens and give the secured creditor nothing but the proceeds from that sale, clause (ii) entitles the secured creditor to bid what it is owed in the absence of cause to preclude it.

We don't dispute that these are three alternative ways to cram down -- down a plan.   The question here is or what?   And the question is the scope of the alternatives and in which circumstances in they apply.   And here Congress turned its attention to precisely the situation at hand and determined what the requirements were, but not just the requirements for a sale free and clear.   It's not like clause (ii) says: If you sell it free and clear and you allow credit bidding, then that's way to go.   It's not just the requirement of credit bidding.   It also sets forth the only exception to credit bidding.   And Petitioners' reading would read clause (iii) to be a much bigger exception.   Now, Petitioners here tried and failed in the Bankruptcy Court to prove cause, and they don't appeal that.   So they are trying to create a much bigger exception to the exception Congress allowed.

So the whole code structure is set up to protect the secured creditor against the risk of undervaluation of its claim.   And that's the section 1111(b) election.   So section 1111(b) election allows the secured creditor who is undersecured and is afraid that their value of their property will be misvalued in a clause (i) to elect to have their entire face value of their claim treated as secured.   So here, the lenders are owed more than $130 million.   If they were to proceed under clause (i), the lenders would have the option to have that whole $130 million treated as secured.   And that would be the value of the secured claim.   And under clause (i), yes, we would then be subject to the judicial determination of the present value of whatever a note paying out $130 million would be, but two protections we would have.

But another instance, and it's actually one that -- that goes to something Justice Kagan asked earlier, which is, when there's some dispute about priority or whether there might be senior liens.   So in this case, the bankruptcy judge provided at 44(a) and 45(a), because there -- there are some real estate taxes that would be senior to our liens, and there's a debate about whether the mechanic liens are senior or not.   And so the bankruptcy judge provided that -- that -- that here, it would be appropriate for us to either put up cash in that amount, the amount of the potentially senior liens, or to offer, you know, some security to cover those in the event that they turn up.   And that is an example of cause, and that is -- clearly answers the concern that there may be others.   No one junior to these creditors is going to take anything.   And all making us cash bid would do, assuming the secured creditors are able to come up with the cash to bid in this amount, would be to endless -- just to pointlessly cycle money into the estate, and then, if we're the winning bid, through the estate and back to us, at the risk of their siphoning off the money that really shouldn't go to anyone else because we have -- the cash collateral is these secured creditors', the hotel and the parking garage are all these secured creditors' collateral.   Now, the Petitioners say this is going to -- if you let the secured creditors bid, this is going to chill credit bidding.   Well, they tried to prove that in the bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy court, at pages 43(a) and 44(a), rejected that as a matter of fact.   But, anyway, as a matter of theory, their proposal -- who would bid in their proposal?   Their proposal is, you do the due diligence, you have to prove you have the money, you put up the bid, and then at the back end you know that the secured creditor is going to be able to come in and tell the bankruptcy judge, I would have bid more with my secured credit.   So anyone who bids knows that there's the potential that it's all going to be a waste of time.   And then how do you do it over at that point?   Once everybody has shown their hand, put their bids in, what, are you going to take a mulligan after the -- after the bankruptcy court says no, they're not getting their indubitable equivalent because I find they would have bid more in their security?

Is this something that is subject of extensive negotiation?   The secured creditor says, well, I'm interested in bidding in a credit bid, but I appreciate that that's going to make it difficult for you to get cash.   And you've got these unsecured creditors who would want -- and so, what?   I'm not going to credit bid, so long as -- or I will only credit bid up to this particular amount; or, let's sit down and work out a deal, negotiate over exactly how we're going to handle my security.

There are actually many negotiations in a plan sale context.   And it would be odd, I would suggest, that you can do a cramdown plan over the secured creditor's objection and have less credit bidding rights than you can when you agree to do it.   And so in the end, there's nothing wrong with the secured creditor coming in and bidding its credit and taking the asset.   After all, they already put in $142 million.   They're owed $130 million.

And as long as the secured creditor is willing to bid at the -- at the auction its secured credit, put its money where its mouth is, that is the value of its -- of its secured claim, and so it could never be the indubitable equivalent to go under (iii), where it's not allowed to bid.

The final clause of clause (ii) says that once the sale goes through, the liens attach to the proceeds of the sale, and the treatment of those liens on the proceeds are done under clause (i) or clause (iii) of this subparagraph.

The essence of being a secured creditor, of course, as the Court has suggested, is that the secured creditor has bargained for the right either to get its money back or to get the thing that secures its loan, to get its collateral.

Harrington", "text": " --The trustee is there, but if the debtor proposes a plan that wouldn't allow the United States to credit bid at an auction that is selling its collateral, then the United States is usually out of luck because the Antideficiency Act prevents us from bidding cash.   Now, I would like to respond to one -- one sort of assumption that has seemed to permeate the conversation here, which is that a secured creditor will always have an incentive to bid the full amount of its claim at an auction of its assets where the auction is supposed to be free of liens.   That is actually not true.   As my friend Ms. Maynard suggested, unless a bank is trying to get into the business of running a hotel or running whatever business is the collateral, the creditor will only want to take the property if it thinks it can make a profit by then turning around and selling the property.   So if there is an auction where there is a cash bid, and the creditor thinks that the value of -- the amount of the cash bid is actually a fair valuation of the property, the creditor has no incentive to bid higher than that in credit, because it has no expectation of getting more money than that when it then takes the property and turns around and sells it.   So allowing the credit bidding won't have the effect of serving as a veto on what would be a fair sale price by a cash bidder.   The secured creditor's incentive is only to bid up to what it -- up to what it views as the value of the property and not a penny more, because it's not trying to take the property just for the property's sake.   In most cases it wants to take the property and then sell the property. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but of course it could bid up if it thinks that there are going to be other bidders, right?   It has a lot more flexibility than the other bidders to -- to the extent of its security interest. "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " I mean, it has more flexibility because it has already put up its money.   But every bidder has that incentive that you suggest, which is to try to make that it's -- to sort of game the system a little bit and -- and make everybody put their money where their mouth is.   The Congress gave secured creditors a right to have a role where they get to put their money where their mouth any time there is-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " That just begs the question.   Congress gave them a right -- I mean, that's what we are deciding, right? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " --Absolutely.   And -- and Petitioner is certainly correct that the phrase \"indubitable equivalent\", an unusual phrase in the statute, that that phrase is broad enough to cover any type of disposition of a secured creditor's claim, including the sale of property free of liens.   But Congress also enacted two much more specific provisions right next to clause (iii), and in those provisions, number (i), which governs -- governs the retention of liens on -- on collateral, and number (ii), which the sale of -- the sale of collateral free of liens, there are very specific protections written into clauses (i) and clause (ii).   And this Court's interpretive canon that a specific provision will trump a more general provision where both could apply would seem clearly to apply here.   If a plan proposes a disposition of a claim that is addressed by a clause (i) or a clause (ii), it doesn't make any sense to allow them to strip out protections that are provided in those clauses by purporting to go under the more general standard of indubitable equivalent.   That is especially true because the type of judicial valuation of the property that would take place under Petitioners' type of scheme is not guaranteed to make sure that the creditor gets what it bargained for, which is either its money or its property, but that is exactly what clause (ii), that type of auction, is guaranteed to do. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What is the reference?   In clause (ii) we were just told, the last clause refers to   \"under clause (i) or clause (iii). \"   What -- what is the reference in (ii) to clause (iii)?   What does that mean? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E. Harrington", "text": " Well, the type of sale contemplated in clause (ii) is essentially a liquidation of the secured creditor's lien on a property.   And so you -- the sale would essentially liquidate the lien and then clause (ii) provides that -- that there would need to be a replacement lien on the proceeds of the sale.   That replacement lien would then have to be treated under clause (i) or clause (iii).   I think it's fair to say in most situations what happens is that the proceeds of the sale are handed over to the secured creditor, which is essentially a clause (iii) treatment of the lien on the proceeds, in the sense that if the lien on the proceeds is a lien on the pile of cash, if you hand over the pile of cash, you're surrendering the collateral that is securing that lien, which is the classic example of indubitable equivalent.   That is one of the examples cited in the legislative history and in Judge Hand's opinion in In re Murel.   I think one of the assumptions that permeates Petitioners' brief is that valuation -- that the value of collateral is something we can all know and agree upon.   But valuation is an inherently difficult undertaking, and this Court has recognized that when Congress enacted the code in 1978 it shifted the preference to move from judicial valuation towards market valuations.   And here Congress in clause (ii) expressed its view that -- that the type of market that would value this property would include one of the most interested market participants, who is -- which is the secured creditor who has an interest in the property. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Of course, valuing property is what bankruptcy judges do all the time, right? "}, {"speaker": "Sarah E.

But I think here Congress provided that this would be a situation where the secured creditor would have a role in valuing the property, and even under -- as Justice Kagan pointed out, even -- I think it was Justice Kagan -- under clause (i) the judge has a role in valuing the property because we have to determine the present day value of the cash stream that the creditor would be owed.   But as judge -- as my friend Ms. Maynard pointed out -- maybe she will be a judge some day--   [Laughter]   --the creditor in that situation has a role in -- in protecting itself against undervaluation because it can make the 1111(b) election, retain the full amount of its claim if it wants, and -- and protect itself going forward.   I think one way that's important is that it protects -- it prevents debtors from cashing out creditors at a low value, at a point where -- in the market where the value of the property is low, because they retain the lien for the full amount.   The same thing is true here.   If this is a particularly low point in the market and the creditor is trying to sell the property at auction -- I'm sorry -- B-the debtor is trying to sell the property at auction, the creditor can come in and take the property and realize any -- any upside down the road.

And if the lenders would like to bring at that point their appraisals and show that we didn't achieve that amount, then we are not going to be able to satisfy the indubitable equivalent standard.   Secondly, with regard to the role that subsection (iii) plays in subsection (ii)-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " What you just said is so long as they come in with some appraisals that are above what -- what the property sold at for cash, then it's not the indubitable equivalent?

So with regard to the market test-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --What happens if you go to the judge and the judge says: There is one higher bid, so I can't say it's indubitable?

So it's no different than at any plan confirmation hearing if you say: Judge, my plan is dependent upon the interest rate being set at 5 percent.   The judge says: Well, I find it should be 6 percent.   You have to find a way to bridge that gap.

Neff", "text": " It's more so that the purchaser would have to come up with that, would have to come up with that or find some other way to bridge that gap.   It's not really a waste of time because again you are allowing the process to play itself out.   Too many times we see with secured creditors they're unwilling to deal with debtors because they have gotten them in the particular situation.   And then when you are able to actually have an auction, they are surprised by how high the bidding gets.   Because bankruptcy auctions are very fulsome events and create -- can create quite a lot of bidding that can really generate very high -- high value for the property.   As far as the role that (iii) plays in (ii), it's a bit convoluted; but, if you pursue a plan sale through subsection (ii), you don't have to show indubitable equivalents as long as they are allowed to credit bid.   But if, in fact, they don't credit bid or they are topped, and you are able to raise cash, that cash must be treated in an indubitable equivalents way or in accordance with subsection (i).

But with regard to the benefit, you look at a case like Philadelphia, or a case like the Pacific Lumber out of the Fifth Circuit, which allowed an entire enterprise to be restructured out of a very positive sale of the timberlands, that would not have occurred if in fact the Court had required credit bidding because the lender simply would have taken back that one crucial asset around which the entire enterprise was restructured.
