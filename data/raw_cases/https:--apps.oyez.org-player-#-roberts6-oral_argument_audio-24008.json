Bright", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The prosecutors in this case came to court on the morning of jury selection determined to strike all the black prospective jurors. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Bright, maybe you could address first the -- the question we raised on Friday with respect to which court certiorari should be directed to. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. We filed this petition originally certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia.   And of course this Court in Sears v. Upton had issued certiorari -- this is in 2010 -- to the Supreme Court of Georgia in a similar situation. It appears to us, from looking at this over the weekend, that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company v. Durham County, which the Court has decided in eight -- in 1986, the Court said that, unless there was positive assurance that the decision was not a ruling on the merits, then the writ went to the State supreme court. And the Georgia court, while it has rules and statutes and its own opinions that are not totally in harmony with one another, the rule, nonetheless, is that a certificate of probable cause, which is what was denied in this case, is to be granted if there is arguable merit to the case. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Do you think that affects the scope of our review? In other words, are we addressing just whether there's arguable merit to the claim or are we addressing the claim on its own merits? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, I -- I think what this Court has done in -- in all these cases is apply Yist v. Nunnemaker to look through to the last reasoned decision, and that would be the decision of the habeas corpus court.   In Georgia, typically the habeas court rules, an application is made for certificate of probable cause to the Georgia Supreme Court, and that is often denied summarily.   It is denied summarily as it was in this case.   It was denied. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I really don't understand that.   You -- you say we would be reversing the Georgia Supreme Court, not the -- not the habeas court, right? And -- and all that the Georgia Supreme Court held is that there -- there -- is that there was no arguable basis for -- for its accepting review. So if we reverse that decision, we -- we tell the Georgia Supreme Court, you're wrong; there is an arguable basis for your accepting review.   So we ought to remand to that court, requiring them to accept review, it would seem to me. How can we reverse them on -- on an issue they -- they never considered? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, that's what happened in R.J. Reynolds.   I mean, there you had almost an identical situation where you had an intermediate appellate court that had ruled, and then you had the North Carolina Supreme Court denied review.   And the question was, do you issue the writ to the intermediate appellate court or to the North Carolina Supreme Court? And -- and this Court decided, and Justice Blackman, writing for the court, said, \"We want to give practitioners\" -- \"We want to end the confusion about this.\" And so it goes to the State supreme court. There is no difference in our situation here and the situation that R.J. Reynolds -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- but you're saying in that case or in other cases?

Kennedy", "text": " Is there an argument that the petition for certiorari could go to the trial court? I mean, our statute says that it goes to the highest court in which review could have -- could have been had, I think is the -- the statutory phrase, in which sounds like the Georgia Supreme Court. On the other hand, as Justice Scalia said, they haven't really directed their attention to the issues before us. I -- I -- I'm not sure to me that it's an option to -- to go to the superior -- to the Georgia trial court. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, let -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

North Carolina last year -- 2015 case, this year, in which, once again, there was an intermediate court decision denied by the -- the North Carolina Supreme Court. I mean, I can remember all the way back to 1960.   There was Thompson v. Louisville, where certiorari was to the police court in Louisville, Kentucky, because no court in Kentucky could take the case because the fine was less than $20. But I think these cases, much more recent, decided by the Court 1986 and this year -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You're putting together two rules that you say we've established.   One is Justice Blackman said, to end the confusion, the petition should be addressed to the Supreme Court. And then you said, we have cases.   Look through cases.   If -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- the Supreme Court has said just \"denied,\" nothing more than \"denied,\" we look back to the last reasoned decision. Those are both decisions of this Court, and that's what you're relying on. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, and -- and they're not mutually exclusive.   This Court can look back through to the last reasoned decision in making its decision in this case, and I believe that's what it should do.   But at the same time, the Court's opinions appear to us, on the quick research we did over the weekend on this, that R.J. Reynolds and -- and the subsequent case say that certiorari would issue to the Georgia Supreme Court. And -- and we listed it that way, and then when the case was docketed here, it was listed that the lower court was the superior court of Butts County. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What if the State supreme court wrote a very short opinion and said, We're not going to determine whether there was, in fact -- the only issue we're going to determine is whether there's any arguable merit to this?

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could I ask you another -- a question about another preliminary issue before you get to the -- the -- the underlying question in the case? The Superior Court said, on page 175 of the Joint Appendix, that the issue of the Batson violation was not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata. And then it later said, and this is 192 of the Joint Appendix, that it will review the Batson claim as to whether Petitioner has shown any change in the facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar. Now, if you put those two together, you could argue that the superior court decided only a question of State law, namely, whether the situation here was such that there could be review of the Batson claim. What is your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, the State doesn't argue that.   And I think the reason for that is because the Court said, we're moving -- the Court is going to address step three of Batson.   And it said, Foster's Batson claim is without merit. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, but is it question of Federal or State law as to whether or not the Petitioner has shown a change in facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar? The one -- the page 192 language that Justice Alito quoted, is that -- is that a State law question or -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " That's a State law question.

Didn't it say that it did -- basically, it was going to do step three of the Batson charge -- challenge? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Yes, that's exactly what the court said, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So that's a ruling on the merits. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " I think -- I think the court said the Batson claim is without merit.   That seems like a ruling on the merits to me. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, it -- I think it said after -- after redoing -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " After considering these other facts.   And we think there was some legal errors made there.   But yes, after considering these facts, the court said that the claim was without merit. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The court said that it would reach step three again on the basis of the new evidence presented, and so they did it all over.   And I guess that's -- we must take that as what happened. They did not apply a res judicata bar. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " No.   I mean, in Ake this Court said, when the resolution of the State procedural law question depends upon a Federal constitutional ruling, the State law prong is not independent of the Federal claim.   And this Court has jurisdiction.   That's on page 75 of 47 United States. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I don't want to belabor the point too much, but you -- are you arguing that Georgia res judicata law is this: If someone comes up with any new fact, the -- the -- the thinnest new fact, that is sufficient to wipe out the res judicata bar and allow the court to get to the merits of the claim? Is that your argument? That's your understanding of Georgia res judicata law? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " That's not my understanding. My understanding is the evidence has to be sufficient enough that the court does what it did in this case and rule on the merits of the issue.   And that's what happened here.   This was not a matter of just adding one more leaf to the basket. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And we really want you to get to the merits, but why is that -- in conjunction with -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " We will. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " -- with Justice Scalia's question, why is that an issue of Federal law? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Because the court decided the Batson issue to decide the underlying State law issue. And I think Ake is pretty clear on this, and I commend it to the Court's attention.   We didn't -- it wasn't -- since the State had raised this, either in their opposition to cert or in their brief, it's not briefed before this Court, but I think that's the deciding case on this. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thanks, counsel.   I think we have your argument on the point.   Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Okay.   Thank you very much. If I could just say what happened here was that the prosecutors had identified the African-Americans by race, they had rated them against each other in case it came down to having to select a black juror. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The prosecutors said the reason for concentrating on the black jurors was that you had informed them you would present a Batson challenge, and therefore, it was necessary for them to see if there was a race-neutral ground for disqualifying that case. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Right.   Two answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, what the lawyers did here was these lawyers have practiced here for a long time in Rome, Georgia.   They said the prosecutor always strikes all the blacks from the jury.   That's been the historic practice.   We think they're going to strike all the blacks on the jury in our case.   But last year the Supreme Court of the United States decided Batson v. Kentucky, and we asked the Court not to let that happen in this case. Now, of course, if the prosecutor is willing to avoid a Batson challenge, they could have not discriminated.   That would have been the first thing to do. But -- but secondly, with regard to the information that's collected here, it doesn't seem like it's information just to exercise strikes when they say, if it comes down to having to take an African-American, Ms. Hardge, or in another place, Ms. Garrett, might be okay.   And the district attorney himself said Marilyn Garrett has the most potential of the black prospective jurors. In other words, the blacks were taken out of the picture here.   They were taken and -- and dealt with separately.   And over the weekend, the jury -- the questioning ended on a Friday.   And the judge said, all right.   Over the weekend, you've got your chance to decide who you're going to strike.   And they knew exactly who they were going to strike because the -- the -- the jurors are listed in order.   The State goes first, and if it accepts a juror, then the State accepts, and that juror is on.   There's no going back. There's no backstriking or there's no striking people here and there. They developed three strike lists.   And one of those strike lists was a list headed \"Definite NOs.\" These are the people absolutely are not going to be on this jury.   There are only six jurors listed on the list of \"Definite NOs,\" and the first five are African-Americans.   The sixth is a juror who made clear during the voir dire process that she could not impose the death penalty under any circumstances.   The State moved to strike her for cause.   The judge probably erred in not granting that strike.   But even she ranked behind the black jurors in terms of the priorities that the prosecution had for -- for striking. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, at this -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Bright -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- at the time, Mr. Lanier said they weren't striking the -- the jurors because of race.   They were striking them because they were women.   And I guess three -- three out of the four -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- African-Americans were -- who were struck were -- were women.   How does that -- and then that explanation is just kind of fallen out of the case. How -- how does that affect the analysis? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, he -- he did accept women, though, as -- as well.   If -- bear with me a -- just a moment. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The Court had not yet held that Batson applies to -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " The Court had not held in JEB that Batson applied to women, but the Court did say in JEB that, of course, it could be used as a pretext, women, for striking on the basis of race. In this case, the prosecutor struck three white jurors, and then he struck the three black jurors, women, the three black women and the three white women. The final -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. -- Mr. Bright, Mr. Lanier -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- answered yes when he asked -- when during the -- during the trial when he was asked whether he had done -- I don't know if it -- oh, no, it was on the motion for a new trial hearing -- whether he had done the same extensive background check on all the jurors, white and black. Did you find any evidence of that extensive black background search? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " No.   The only -- what that's talking about -- and -- and the investigator said this in his deposition, was the color -- race-coded colored list, those first four lists you have in the Joint Appendix in which the blacks are marked with a \"B\" and are highlighted in green with a marker up at the corner saying green designates black. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So -- so your -- your understanding of that statement was that all -- he had only done an extensive search on the blacks on the list? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, it's clear, Mr. Lundy had prepared a -- a list, notes in which he talked about just the black jurors in -- in the case.   And I think the State concedes in its brief that the focus was on the black jurors. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " During the trial, did defense counsel, when he made his initial Batson challenge -- not in the papers, but at trial -- did he again say that this was part and parcel of the prosecutor's pattern? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " He didn't say that, but I point this interesting thing out.   When they discussed the Batson motion before trial, there was never a suggestion that there wouldn't be a Batson hearing.   Everybody knew what was going to happen, that all the blacks would be struck, and then they'd have a hearing after that happened.   But the defense had basically put their motion in writing and relied upon that throughout the jury selection. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I was just surprised that we didn't hear about this preparation for a Batson hearing until -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- the habeas. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " The -- the defense lawyers at trial did move for the prosecution's notes.   And the prosecution opposed that.   They're very strict in not -- not giving up their notes.   Then when the prosecutor testified on the motion for a new trial, he did something I've never seen a lawyer do before.   He cut a bargain, sort of, with the judge and the lawyer saying, I will testify, but only if I don't have to show them my notes. I mean, basic rules of evidence are you testify and rely upon notes; the other side can see the notes.   But here, these notes were guarded until 2006, when we obtained them through a Freedom of Information or what they call Open Records Act in Georgia. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The prosecutors said that you -- they said, we never -- we never wrote or authorized or relied on those notes.   And you didn't call the prosecutors to test the veracity of that assertion. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " No, but all the prosecutor talked about were the color-highlighted notes.   Each prosecutor filed an affidavit which are in the -- in the Joint Appendix at 168.   And all they said was, we didn't highlight it in green, and we didn't tell anybody else to highlight it in green.   And then Mr. Lanier says -- and I don't have anything else to say beyond what I said at the Batson hearing and the motion for a new trial. Mr. Pullen said -- the only other thing he said is, I didn't use those green-highlighted lists in choosing the jury; but, of course, that's just the first few pages. What's damning about this is not so much that, but the \"Definite NOs\" list, the misrepresentation to the trial court that Ms. Garrett -- that they wanted Ms. Garrett.   That's what they told the trial court. And the trial court relied upon that in denying the Batson motion, that this showed their openness to having -- Ms. Garrett was on the \"Definite NO\" list. She was on each of the strike lists.   Ms. Garrett was never in the running to be on this jury. But they represented to the court that because another African-American, Shirley Powell, was excused for cause -- there were five African-Americans in the venire at the start when they got ready to instruct the jury.   But one said, turns out I know somebody in the family.   She was excused for cause.   And the prosecutors said -- made it -- implied clearly that had it not been for that, that extra strike, that Ms. Garrett would have sat. At the same time -- and they're still arguing this both ways, that they both wanted her and didn't want her -- they give eleven reasons for why Ms. Garrett would not be a good juror.   That she's impudent and she doesn't respect the court.   If you believe all the things they said about her, they would never want her as a juror. But those things, I would submit, are not really valid in terms of -- in terms of the reasons, because the reasons they gave here, many were demonstrably false and not supported by the evidence, including reasons they gave about Ms. Garrett.   They were inconsistent, some were completely incredible, and they applied to white jurors -- some of these reasons applied to white jurors who had the same characteristics as the African-Americans who were struck. And then lastly, and what's so important under Miller-El, they didn't question the jurors about the reasons for striking them.   They gave reasons for striking, and one question would have cleared up some of these.   And Miller-El says that the failure to engage in any meaningful voir dire about whatever your reason is, is evidence suggesting that the explanation is a sham and a pretext. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Bright -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " And -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- I have found some circuit courts who have a rule on appeal or on habeas which is if they can find one legitimate reason for striking a juror -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- that's enough to defeat a Batson challenge.   Do you believe that's an appropriate rule? Are you suggesting a different approach to the question? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, it can't -- I -- I would suggest it -- it can't possibly be.   Because this Court said in Justice Alito's opinion in Snyder v. Louisiana that where the peremptory strike was shown to have been motivated in substantial part by race, that it could not be sustained.   And -- excuse me -- I -- I would suggest to you, it shouldn't even really say substantial. Because if this Court, as it said so many times, is engaged in unceasing efforts to end race discrimination in the criminal courts, then a strike that -- strikes motivated by race cannot be tolerable. And, of course, as -- as pointed out here in the -- in the amici, this is a serious problem, not just in this case, but in other cases where people come to court with their canned reasons and just read them off. That happened in this case, where one of the reasons that was given was just taken verbatim out of a -- two of the reasons given were taken verbatim out of a reported case.   So you don't have the reason for the lawyer in this case.   He said my personal preference. It wasn't his personal preference.   It was the personal preference of some U.S. attorney in Mississippi who gave that reason, and then it was upheld on appeal by -- by the Fifth Circuit.

I think the fact that there is a laundry list suggests in and of itself that the Court should scrutinize the reasons very carefully, should be suspect of the reasons.

So under a circumstance like that, couldn't the Court say, well, the one -- there's one reason here that would -- that is clearly a justification for a peremptory strike? We don't have to determine whether there's evidence that the person was looking down at the floor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Well, of course, Batson says, and the subsequent cases say, you look at all relevant circumstances.   It may be if all the circumstances that are there, the ones you said, then you would come to the conclusion that of those two reasons that there was a valid reason.

It turns on the credibility of the prosecutor. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes, but all -- all I'm saying -- and you seem to be agreeing -- is that it is not the overall Batson judgment that's before us but rather the judgment that the -- that the new evidence did not suffice to create a Batson violation where none existed before.

Bright", "text": " No.   Our position is that when you look at the new evidence with all the evidence at trial, that all relevant circumstances considered together, considering that a lot of these reasons we now know from the notes, we now know from the notes that there were misrepresentations with regard to these reasons. I mean, the Georgia Supreme Court -- just as an example, Justice Scalia -- upheld the strike on Ms. Garrett on two bases: That she was a social worker and that her cousin had been arrested for drugs.   She was not a social worker, and secondly, the prosecutor didn't find out until after trial about her cousin's arrest, so it couldn't have possibly been a reason for the strike.

You have a lot of new information here from these files that suggests that what the prosecutors were doing was looking at the African-American prospective jurors as a group, that they had basically said, we don't want any of these people.   Here is the one we want if we really have to take one.   But that there -- the -- all the evidence suggests a kind of singling out, which is the very antithesis of the Batson rule.

Burton", "text": " I don't think it is.   And I think, because these notes that we have, they don't undermine any of the findings that were given by the prosecutor in his strikes, particularly of Mr. -- Mr. Hood and Ms. Garrett. They certainly can be interpreted in two ways.   In -- in our response brief to this Court -- we don't know when we say, you know, this is why these highlights are there.   There is a reasonable explanation, just as Mr. Foster is given speculation in his arguments.   We don't know. But when they're -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " What is the reasonable explanation? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " The reasonable explanation in this case is, four months prior to trial, as was previously argued, Batson had just come out.   Batson is new.   Four months prior to trial, defense counsel files a motion and says, the strike of any black juror, we're filing a Batson challenge.   Two weeks prior to trial, he says -- he files a motion and says, I'm -- there's racial disparity in 179 jurors.   And that's the -- that's the list that's challenged, the 179.   There is racial disparity of black prospective jurors on that list. The day of trial, he re-files that.   So I would be more surprised, quite frankly, if there wasn't some sort of highlighting, or if -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " In other words, the argument you're making here -- "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- is that -- is that the reason he highlighted all the black jurors in green and thus said black -- what about the black jurors and did all these different things was because he was preparing a defense in case of a Batson challenge. "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   Now, if that's correct, why this is -- is this the first -- is it -- was this argument made before your main brief in this case? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " And it was not -- JUSTICE BREYER? It's been several years. Yes or no? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " And it was not.   And that's -- and -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It was not. So if that had been his real reason, isn't it a little surprising that he never thought of it -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- or didn't tell anybody until you raise this argument in your main brief? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " And -- and I -- I would -- I would say that's on State habeas counsel.   We relied on our res judicata bar throughout State habeas; and then after that, basically defended the factual findings of the State habeas. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   It seems to me you have two arguments. One is this argument that he never thought of, apparently, or at least never thought to tell you until quite recently.   And the other, after years, and so it's hard to believe that's his real reason. And then there's the second argument that he had about 40 different reasons.   And at least some of them could be valid.   Okay. Now, if my grandson tells me, I don't want to watch -- I don't want to do my homework tonight at 7:00 because I'm just so tired.   And besides, I promised my friend I'd play basketball.   And besides that, there's a great program on television.   And besides that, you know, I really -- my stomach is upset, but I want to eat spaghetti.   And so he's now given me five different reasons. What do I think of those reasons? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " Well, in this case -- and again, I think this is -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " One may be valid. "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " Correct, and the other ones also may be -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Which one? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " Well, they all may be valid, but they all may not be as strong as -- as the -- as the first one.   But in this case, I think the important part -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, wait.   The point is he gave 40 different reasons.   And the very fact that he gives 40 different reasons -- and many of them are self-contradictory, obviously not applicable, totally different from -- you know, that's why I used my grandchild's analogy.   All right? And so I would say my answer to my grandchild is, look, you're not too tired to do your homework.   And I think any reasonable person looking at this would say, no, his reason was a purpose to discriminate on the basis of race. Now, tell me why I'm wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " I think because you have to look at the time period this was done.   This was done not -- you know, a year after Batson came out.   And even throughout the transcript, people -- defense counsel and the prosecutor says, we're -- we don't really know where Batson is going. So in this case, the prosecutor, dealing with Batson for the first time, the first time in history anybody has had to put strikes on the record. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But he's simply wrong.   He puts down, if it comes -- if it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors -- was it Ms. Garrett? -- might be okay. "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " And that's -- that's Mr. Lundy. That's the investigator. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " So it -- it -- it -- well, but that seems to me to undercut the argument, well, they're just feeling their way and so forth.   They've -- they've made a mistake -- they've made a mistake of -- in Batson.   Sure it was new; but they're wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " Well, first let me say, I think that's why there was a laundry list because he was just espousing every reason he had.   But with regard to Mr. Lundy's, notes, and that was the investigator who said if we have to choose a black juror, she may be the best one. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Who was responsible for the definite no list? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " The definite no list, nobody -- the only person that was asked about that was Mr. Lundy, who was deposed and said he could not identify who wrote that list.   So we don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " There are only three possible choices. "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " We -- right.   We know it came from the D.A.'s office. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And it -- and it exists -- the paper exists.   It says \"Definite NO.\" "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " Correct.   And I don't think that is -- I don't think that was a ranking of jurors, because when you look, they did score jurors throughout.

"}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- on the definite -- well, one of them was Garrett -- this -- as was pointed out.   They said, if we have to have one, let it be Garrett.   But Garrett then shows up on the definite no list. "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " Correct.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Were we told that the only three people who did the investigation on Batson were the two prosecutors on the case and Mr. Lundy?

Burton", "text": " It has to be one of the two prosecutors, and one was not there on the day it was struck -- the jury was struck; only Mr. Lanier was.

"}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What do you do with other -- I mean, it just -- it seems an out-and-out false statement.   The reason that's given -- one of the reasons for Garrett's being struck is that her cousin was arrested.   But then the prosecutor doesn't know that at the time of the voir dire.   He doesn't know until after the voir dire that the cousin was arrested.   So how could it possibly be a reason at the time of the voir dire? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " And I don't think the record bears that out.   These notes -- the highlighted notes that Petitioner wants to say, these were used during voir dire, these were using during the strikes, in those notes -- and this is at Joint Appendix page 256 -- Angela is written out beside Ms. Garrett's name.   In Mr. Lundy's notes where he said he wrote down things he knew prior to the strikes, prior to voir dire of what he knew about individual jurors, he wrote down as to Marilyn Garrett, Angela Garrett is a cousin.

Burton", "text": " And when he initially strikes -- when Mr. Lanier initially explains his strikes, he does state her age, so he is not trying to say she's 23.   He states her age as 34.   And throughout, the overall theme was, we don't want younger jurors. We're looking for older jurors closer to the age of the victim, age 79. So I think -- you know, maybe -- I know it's not -- not the most articulate framing of it, but I think it's more of a generational, she was younger.   And that, the age, I don't think was a make-or-break factor. Working at Head Start with underprivileged children, a make-or-break factor; a similarly situated white juror also struck for that same purpose. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- but Ms. Burton, wouldn't you agree, in a lot of these Batson cases, you'll have purported justifications, which they could support a valid peremptory strike, right? But that the question for a court is, well, but did they support this valid peremptory strike? In other words, what was the prosecutor thinking? Batson is a rule about purposeful discrimination, about intent. And so it doesn't really matter that there might have been a bunch of valid reasons out there, if the -- if it was clear that the prosecutor was thinking about race. You agree with that, right? "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " I think if his intent was to strike based on race. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yes, if his intent was to strike based on race, it doesn't matter that he could have had a different intent that would have supported a good peremptory strike.   And so the question of whether, you know, someone or other might have been properly struck by -- by a prosecutor isn't really the question. The question is on the total amount of evidence before us, including all these prosecutors' notes, what was going on with respect to each of these peremptory strikes. And then you have to deal with not just, oh, it could have been this or it could have been that, but you have to deal with all this information that what it really was, was they wanted to get the black people off the jury. "}, {"speaker": "Beth A. Burton", "text": " And -- and I don't think these notes show that.

And the prosecutor, Mr. Lanier, says, I will -- said, I will give my notes to the court to look at en banc if defense counsel will do the same. Defense counsel chose not to do so.   That issue was raised on appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court, direct appeal.   The Georgia court -- Georgia court found it was work product; it didn't have to be turned over. When we got to State habeas proceedings, they found an open records request under Georgia law. And they were immediately turned over.   I -- I don't think there was any argument about it at that point.

There's an assumption that she has a relationship with this cousin.   I have cousins who I know have been arrested, but I have no idea where they're in jail.   I hardly -- I don't know them.

That sounds like Batson to me. And then he goes on to say, \"And in addition there is no good reason given, now or then.\" And then he concludes, \"Accordingly, the court finds the renewed Batson claim is without merit.\" So if I read just that paragraph, I would think the reason that the judge found in your favor is he decided the Batson claim in your favor.   He didn't have to.   He could have gone on some other ground, but that's the ground he did go on. But at worst, why isn't it ambiguous?

"}, {"speaker": "Stephen B. Bright", "text": " Thank you.   Very quickly, let me first say that with regard to what Justice Alito quoted that it's just come to our attention since the trial of the case that Ms. Garrett cousin was arrested. That was on May the 1st.   That was after the death verdict had been returned in this case. Secondly, if you look at the Joint Appendix on page 56 and 57 where they give the reasons for striking Ms. Garrett, there is no mention of her cousin whatsoever in there.   That's the time when she should have been mentioned, after the strikes were made.   And yet there is no mention of that at all. So I don't think there's any way -- and then six months later, there is a motion for new trial, and now the prosecution is adding new reasons that it didn't give at the Batson hearing. It's saying she was a social worker.   She wasn't a social worker.   It's saying her cousin was arrested.   They didn't know that at the time they struck the jury.   They said she's low income, taking another thing out of United States v. Cartlidge.   But you can't add reasons on into perpetuity.   The reasons are the reasons articulated in -- in Miller-El, and the prosecutor has got to stand or fall on the reasons. With regard to the questions, I -- I just want to make one quick point on that because there's not much time.   But with regard to Ms. Garrett and Martha Duncan, who were both teachers aides, who were at schools that were literally right in the same neighborhood -- Ms. Duncan had kindergarten students; Ms. Garrett was Head Start -- no questions: What kind of children do you have, Ms. Duncan? I mean, Ms. Duncan, if you look at the -- they also said familiarity with the neighborhood. Ms. Garrett lived, like, 18 or 20 miles away. Ms. Duncan lived 200 -- her -- her school was 250 yards away, and she lived a half-mile from the school. Both of them answered that they weren't familiar with the area where the victim lived.   Now then some more questions after those answers would have provided a difference.   But instead, Ms. Garrett is treated as a liar, and Ms. Duncan is accepted and actually serves as a juror in this case. And there are other examples, with Mr. Hood particularly, with regard to the child.   If you had asked: What about your child who was arrested? He was put on probation -- he was -- $180 of -- can I have just a second? -- $180 restitution, and he went off to the -- this is in the record -- went off to the Navy, served his country honorably, got an honorable discharge, and came back.   That -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted. "}]
