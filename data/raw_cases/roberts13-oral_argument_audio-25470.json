[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 21-887, Perez versus Sturgis Public Schools. Mr. Martinez. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 12 years, Sturgis neglected Miguel, denied him an education, and lied to his parents about the progress he was allegedly making in school.   This shameful conduct permanently stunted Miguel's ability to communicate with the outside world.   It also violated two federal statutes, the IDEA and the ADA, giving different remedies to victims of discrimination. Miguel responded by doing everything the IDEA wants him to do.   He filed an IDEA agency claim.   He followed the IDEA settlement procedures.   And he accepted a favorable settlement giving him full IDEA relief, including an immediate FAPE. Sturgis wants you to hold that this settlement extinguishes Miguel's separate and distinct rights to money damages under the ADA. You should reject that. I want to emphasize three points. First, the text only requires exhaustion if a non-IDEA claim seeks relief that's actually available under the IDEA.   Exhaustion isn't required in cases like this one seeking only money damages, a remedy the IDEA does not authorize. Second, Miguel's settlement fully exhausted the IDEA procedures.   Further exhaustion is unnecessary and it's futile because it would be pointless.   Miguel has already received everything he's entitled to under the IDEA statute. And, third, the net effect of Sturgis's arguments here is to defy the IDEA's clear purpose.   That purpose is twofold: one, getting kids a FAPE as quickly as possible, and, two, preserving their legal rights under other statutes and the Constitution. Sturgis puts these goals on a collision course with each other.   In any given case, its rule will either disincentivize settlements and block immediate FAPE relief, or it will nullify rights under other statutes. That makes no sense. Congress didn't punish kids for saying yes to favorable IDEA settlements.   One way or the other, this case should proceed. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " If the -- this -- if this statute were written in a way that you had a progression of remedies from administrative, from informal to formal, and it was about the very same thing, that is, the education of Petitioner, then why -- then wouldn't this be exhausted at some level? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Your Honor, we have -- just to step back and sort of clarify, we have a number of different arguments.   Our second -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I -- I guess the difference -- the -- the difficulty I'm having is I can't see where ADA fits in with "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " That seems to be an entirely different remedy, and whether we -- when we have PLRA cases, et cetera, it's usually about the same thing. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " A hundred percent, Your Honor.   I think that's exactly the right way to think about the statute.   And I think what Congress was trying to do here was essentially say we want you to have rights under both statutes, we want you to be able to go into court if necessary and vindicate your separate rights to separate types of relief under both statutes.   But, in circumstances -- in certain circumstances, we want you to go through the IDEA administrative procedures first. And the text of the statute says that if your ADA claim is only seeking things that you can't get under the IDEA, in the words of Fry, if the consequence of your ADA claim, if you brought it in the IDEA procedure, would be that the IDEA hearing officer would have to send you away empty-handed because that statute just does not provide you that type of relief, that type of relief is not available, then you do not have to exhaust. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I guess that's why I'm having trouble considering it exhaustion. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Because it seems to be -- normally, you would think of exhaustion as being similar.   The relief would be similar to the exhausted claims. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " This seems to be an entirely different statute.   So I don't understand even the use of the term \"exhaustion\" here. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I -- I think it's -- it's a -- it's a unique sort of a one-of-a-kind statute, and I think that in this kind of circumstance where you have a unique statute, two things. One, it's especially important to focus on the exact text of the statute, and the text of the statute, the overwhelmingly most reasonable reading of the statute, the only reasonable reading of the statute in our view, is that if you are seeking money damages -- and everyone agrees money damages are not available under the IDEA -- then you just do not have to exhaust.   The exhaustion requirement doesn't apply. Even if you disagreed with us on that, though, I think that in a -- in a -- in a situation like this, where the exhaustion requirement is saying you need to exhaust the IDEA administrative procedures on your IDEA claim, in a circumstance where those procedures specifically say you need to engage in a settlement process, presumably, in good faith, and if the school comes to you in the settlement process and says you're right, we were wrong, we're going to give you everything you're asking for, we're going to give you everything you're entitled to under the IDEA, of course, the statute wants you to say yes. And that's exactly what happened here. Miguel got an offer of full relief and he accepted it.   That's -- that is a success story under the IDEA.   It's not a success story in total -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " -- in -- in -- in -- it doesn't make Miguel completely whole because he suffered other damages as well.   But, under the IDEA, he got everything he was entitled to -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, the -- the -- the two -- "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " -- and he sat -- he exhausted. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- the -- the two are not entirely unrelated.   I mean, in each -- in both cases, your -- your claims are going to be based on the denial of an F-A-P-E or a FAPE.   And it's certainly reasonable to assume that the settlement process under the IDEA could well be significant in resolving the other claims. It seems to me that what's unusual in this case is that the school board said, well, don't worry about those, we're going to settle this.   I mean, if this were any other type of litigation, the lawyers would want to say, we've got a lot on the table and let's figure out how to resolve it. And it's not clear to me why you would necessarily or artificially separate those two. And, of course, your -- your friend on the other side has a construction answer to your notion of how the exhaustion works, that relief, the relief you're seeking, is based on a FAPE.   That's what's going to be pertinent in all those cases.   Why isn't that -- "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " So -- so two points to that, Your Honor.   First of all, I think it's certainly true that if you bring the IDEA claim, you could have a settlement discussion that encompasses not just the IDEA claims but also other claims that you might have that haven't yet been asserted in that process. And I think the normal thing that we would expect is that when bargain -- when parties are bargaining and if this -- if the child is going to give up those other claims, they're going to get something in return. In this case, that settlement discussion happened, and, you know, the -- the -- there was a settlement discussion, and Miguel would have turned down a request to give up ADA rights without any compensation for those ADA rights. And the effect of Sturgis's rule is that if he accepts the settlement on the IDEA claim, it, like, automatically gets rid of -- it essentially gives the school a full release, a get-out-of-jail-free card on the ADA liability, and that's just not right. And I think the second thing I was going to say, Your Honor, is that this isn't artificial, an artificial limit.   This is a limit that comes out of the text of the statute.   And Congress was very clear, it chose words very precisely, and it said that you -- it made clear you don't have to exhaust if the relief you're seeking in the non-IDEA claim is not available under the IDEA. And I think, in -- in these circumstances, it makes sense to -- to read that language the way you would apply -- you would look at the same words elsewhere in the IDEA, the -- the same word \"relief\" appears elsewhere, and it means what we say it means. That's the way the -- the word \"relief\" is used in other legal contexts. That's consistent and I think reinforced by the reasoning of Fry, which says that if you have to go to the hearing officer and the hearing officer would necessarily turn you away empty-handed, we don't want exhaustion in that circumstance. This Court's decision in Carr versus Saul announces the very common-sense principle, this is two terms ago, saying that \"it -- it makes little sense to require litigants to present claims to adjudicators who are powerless to grant the relief requested.\" "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Mr. Martinez -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " One of the -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- arguments that the Respondents make, Mr. Martinez, is that on your reading of the statute, all that a plaintiff has to do is put the words \"compensatory damages\" into a complaint and then the person can head off to federal court, ignoring the exhaustion procedures which Congress did think were important in resolving what to do about the denial of a FAPE. So what is your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I -- I -- I don't think that's going to happen.   And the -- the -- the procedures -- if, by -- by tacking compensatory damages on to the complaint, what you're suggesting is that you could sort of circumvent the IDEA process by going and getting all the IDEA remedies along with ADA remedies for compensatory damages in court, absolutely not. If you go to court and you have a claim that asks for relief that is available under the IDEA and you have not exhausted that request for that relief, the Court cannot move forward as to that request for relief. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So the court -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What do you -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- would be required to -- to split it up and send you back on any other claims? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Right.   It could dismiss the portions of the complaint that are not properly exhausted, or it could give the -- the plaintiff a choice to get rid of the whole case and so the -- the plaintiff could come back later in the whole case, but either way -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And is there something a little odd, even supposing that's true, about two parallel proceedings going on in that way, one for damages and the other for, you know, the relief that an IDEA officer can give? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I -- I don't think there's anything odd.   I think sometimes this sort of situation comes up in the law, and I think there's a very ready response to that, which is that if -- if a court thinks that there's an agency considering a similar factual scenario dealing with similar issues, what the court can just do is -- is issue a stay. We think that would be perfectly appropriate if this Court wants to say that in -- in the cases -- and we think there will be rare cases where parallel proceedings are pending, and in those cases -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why -- why rare? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I think it'll be rare because most parents are going to do what Miguel did here, which is not bring the parallel proceeding.   Rather, in -- in -- in the real world, the way these cases tend to be litigated, parents do not typically have a lot of resources.   Their lawyers are busy.   They are busy.   And, usually, they're not going to try to be litigating simultaneously similar sets of facts in two different forum.   They're going to do one and then the other. As the Chief pointed out, it's possible that you could reach some sort of global settlement that comes out of the IDEA discussion that actually is going to resolve and give you effective relief on your ADA claim as well.   I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And even -- even if it is odd, though, Mr. Martinez, isn't that exactly what the statute seems to contemplate? I mean, I guess I'm wondering whether or not we're even in a position to question the notion of dual proceedings, given that at least as I read the statute, Congress is contemplating that you'll have a situation in which there's a civil action that's seeking relief that is not available under the IDEA. So I -- I take this to mean that Congress thought that dual actions at least in some circumstances were possible and that was fine. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I think that's exactly right under the statute.   And I think that the nice thing about the statute is that it doesn't take away the -- the inherent discretion of district courts to manage their dockets in this way. And if you thought or five of you thought that it was important to give some guidance to lower courts and sort of remind them that if they wanted to -- to stay parallel proceedings, if you were concerned about that, you could do that. On the other hand, Justice Jackson, I think you are right that the statute does not seem to say that it has to be a stay. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " I mean, in -- in -- in my view -- and maybe you can just react to that -- is -- isn't -- isn't what really is going on here that Congress was concerned about people doing an end run around the IDEA in a certain way? That is, you have, you know, a set of facts concerning the denial of a FAPE that could give rise to claims under, let's say, both of these statutes, the IDEA and the ADA, and, you know, the -- the plaintiff is the master of their complaint and can decide which statute to bring it under. And so, in a situation in which the relief that is being asked for is only the kind of relief that is available under the IDEA, maybe Congress didn't want the person to call that an ADA statute and thereby get around the exhaustion. But, if you're asking for something else, if your claim is something else, then Congress didn't have a problem with both of those proceeding in tandem. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I -- I think that's -- that's absolutely a fair way of looking at the statute, and there's certainly no circumvention concern when the only thing you need is something that you can't get under the IDEA. Again, if the hearing -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, what do you -- Mr. Martinez, what do you make of the fact that 1415(f) uses the term \"remedies\" and then also uses the term \"relief\"? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Are you talking about the -- the 1415(l), the exhaustion provision, or -- or -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I -- I'm sorry, yes, that's what I'm talking about. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I -- I think that -- I don't make much of that, Your Honor, because I think that whatever \"remedies\" might mean, \"relief\" really only has one reasonable meaning here, and it means the specific remedies that you can get at the end of the case. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, why would they -- compensatory damages is a remedy.   Why wouldn't they use the term \"remedies\" there? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I think they -- I think they could have used the term \"remedies\" there, but I don't think that they had to.   And I don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It's just elegant variation? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Yeah.   And there are other places in the U.S. Code where you have these terms, \"remedies\" and \"relief,\" used in close proximity without any reason to think that they mean something different. You know, two examples I'd point you to, Your Honor, these aren't in the briefs, but 18 U.S.C. 3626(d), 28 U.S.C. 3306.   Like, these statutes sometimes just use these terms interchangeably. The other side says that \"remedies\" actually has a different meaning as well, a means of enforcement meaning, which I think got a little bit of discussion yesterday, but even if that were true, that wouldn't affect the statutory term at issue here we do believe. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " How have the courts of appeals interpreted this provision? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " The courts of appeals have generally not agreed with our first argument, which is that the text of the statute has to come out our way, although I would note that two of the courts of appeals have done that, although they've acknowledged that our side has the better textual argument. I think the First Circuit and the Fifth Circuit have said that.   Judge Bumatay's dissenting opinion in the Ninth Circuit I think makes the same point pretty -- pretty well. They have -- the courts of appeals have generally agreed with us on our futility argument, which is that the settlement constitutes futility.   And I think that one thing that's important here is we have a bunch of different arguments and they're -- they're kind of confusing.   I actually -- it's confusing to kind of distinguish them. I think that one thing that's really important here is to look at the net effect of Sturgis's responses.   And maybe you -- you could think, okay, they have a fair point on this argument or a fair point on that argument, but if you step back from all of it, the bottom-line position that -- the bottom-line place that Sturgis arrives at is that a parent who does everything right, Miguel's parents and Miguel, they did everything right, they accepted the settlement, they lose their ADA claims.   That just can't be right. I mean, imagine -- put yourself in a parent's position.   They have wonderful claims under both the IDEA and the ADA.   Say their child has been denied a FAPE, sent to a room for disabled children and there has suffered medical injuries.   They've got claims under both statutes. And then the school comes to them and says: Okay, we know you're desperate to get a new IEP, desperate to remedy your immediate on-the-ground denial of FAPE, we're going to give you that.   What do you want the parent to do? What does Sturgis want the parent to do? Apparently, Sturgis has -- there are two answers.   Number one, you can accept the settlement, but the price of accepting the settlement, even though the settlement doesn't give up ADA rights, is to extinguish your ADA rights. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, when you have a -- "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " That can't possibly -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- situation like this, the -- the result, the nature of the settlement could reflect a strategic choice on the part of both parties.   It could also reflect bad lawyering on the part of one or both parties. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Right.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If it's the latter, what -- why does this case make that much difference? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Well, I -- I think that -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, the -- the -- the parents' attorneys, maybe they're -- they may not be that sophisticated, but they could have -- both parties could have discussed whether they wanted to wrap up the whole thing in the settlement.   They could have done that. Or they could say, well, we're not going to do that and we'll take our chances later in litigation. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Well, I think -- I think your point about how the settlement negotiations would play out is extremely important, and I think it favors us because what -- our rule would allow the parties to come together.   If they can reach a global settlement of everything, terrific. But, if they can only reach a partial settlement, if they can only reach a settlement that addresses the IDEA claims, our rule would say, yes, of course, in that case, the student and the parents should accept that settlement, get the on-the-ground FAPE relief immediately, and then the parties can agree to go on and fight about the ADA claims for relief later. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, and the settlement could have specifically preserved the other claims too. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Well, I -- I think, under their rule, it could not because, under their rule, if you accept a settlement, you automatically extinguish your ADA claims. So our rule allows the parties a sort of freedom of contract.   Their rule says, if you -- if you're not willing to give up the ADA claims, you get -- you can't get anything by settlement because the -- the effect of the settlement is to give up everything.   That rule doesn't make sense. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you. Justice Thomas? "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Just back to my original question.   Can you think of another area in which the -- the -- the claim that is exhausted doesn't naturally fit the claim that you're trying to pursue? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I think this is a one-of-a-kind statute, Your Honor, and I -- I'm not aware of any -- any statute like that. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " And much of the difficulty seems to flow from the fact that it doesn't flow -- it doesn't -- it isn't a natural progression of rights.   Normally, you have informal, administrative, and then judicial, all about the very same thing, pursuing a similar remedy at different stages. This is a different remedy under a different statute, so I'm just wondering if there's anything close to it.   Is there an analogue? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I -- I don't know that there's an -- I don't know of any analogue.   I will say one thing because I think your comment really emphasizes -- it underscores one thing that's important about how this Court has always talked about and interpreted exhaustion requirements. It's not like exhaustion is like some sort of one-size-fits-all rule that you apply mechanically in every case.   What the Court has said is that exhaustion means, you know, going through the administrative procedures to an appropriate conclusion and that that needs to be looked at given the particulars of the statutory and administrative scheme at issue. And in this case, where you have a one-of-a-kind administrative scheme that sort of bizarrely requires you to exhaust procedures for one claim before bringing a different claim, it makes perfect sense to treat a settlement agreement, which is a preferred resolution, not just appropriate but preferred resolution of the IDEA claim, it makes perfect sense to treat that preferred resolution as an appropriate conclusion of the IDEA process that at that point constitutes settlement and allows you to bring your ADA claim for different relief. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito? "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Under Fry, is the gravamen of Petitioner's complaint the denial of a FAPE? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Your Honor, we -- we challenged that and we litigated that below. As the case comes to this Court, we are no longer challenging that.   And so, for purposes of -- of your decision, we think that -- that, you know, the Fry -- the -- the gravamen is the same.   It is -- the gravamen of the case does involve a FAPE denial, so we haven't pressed that here. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " In answer, earlier answer, to Justice Alito's question, you said that according to the court below, which is sort of the difficulty with it, if you win an IDEA case, you then can't pursue any other remedies, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " That was the logic of the court below, and we strongly disagree with that logic. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Clearly.   But putting that aside, let's assume the parallel litigation question.   We know in the normal course of things the agency findings under the IDEA are given deference by the court reviewing it, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I think it depends what you mean by \"deference,\" but, certainly, respectful consideration.   But I don't think they're binding, and -- and the parents are allowed to bring in new evidence.   So it's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Yes, but there is some deference.   Does the same hold true under an ADA claim? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " No, Your Honor.

Your brief at one point references some of the legislative history, and I just want to give you a chance to reflect on what Congress's actual intentions may have been with respect to the enactment of this provision. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " So I think the legislative history in two places is helpful both in illustrating Congress's intentions and also in confirming the original public meaning of -- of the statutory text that was enacted. For purposes of our first argument, I think the most important thing is the House report at page 7, and what it says there is that -- it's interpreting the language that was -- ultimately became law, and it said that exhaustion is not required when -- and I'm quoting -- \"the hearing officer lacks the authority to grant the relief sought.\" So that just confirms our textual argument that if you're seeking relief that's not available, you -- you don't have to exhaust because there the hearing officer wouldn't grant relief. I think the legislative history is also helpful on our argument that -- that the best way to think about a settlement is that it -- it -- it constitutes exhaustion or supports a futility argument.   And there I would point you to the Senate report, which says that -- and, here, I'm quoting again -- \"exhaustion of administrative remedies would be excused where they would not be required to be exhausted under the [IDEA], such as when resort to those proceedings would be futile.\" And so that recognizes that there is a futility exception that is available under this statute, contrary to what -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Is -- isn't that also helpful with your first argument insofar as, you know, if, again, if you're sort of conceptualizing it the way that I am, which is exhaustion being only required for the same relief and to the same extent that it would be as if you were bringing the other claim? So Congress was trying, I think, to prevent the end-run scenario. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " You can't just call an IDEA claim an ADA claim and get out of exhausting it to the same extent as you would have to if it was labeled IDEA. "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " I -- I think you're absolutely right.   I think that that -- that futility argument would also apply.   I think, you know, the fact that it's futile to go to an agency officer -- official and ask for money damages when they can't give you money damages, I think that is an example of futility. I will say that the courts of appeals that have looked at this have said that there is -- have generally said that there is a futility exception.   Eleven circuits have said that, although they generally have not treated a request for a different type of damages as futility. But I think you're right, Justice Jackson, that that language in the futility sort of concept here, you know, would give us -- get to the same place, and I think, actually, the text of the statute in many ways is intended to codify that, that general idea. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony A. Yang", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The path Petitioner took in this case was exactly right.   He settled his IDEA claim, obtained prompt educational relief, and then filed a separate ADA action for compensatory damages, things he couldn't get under the IDEA. But, under the Sixth Circuit's ruling, Petitioner would have had to reject a favorable IDEA settlement and forgo the attorneys' fees, delay needed educational relief, and pursue pointless administrative proceedings that cannot provide remedies that the ADA provides simply to pursue the remedies that he already secured by settlement. That makes no sense.   The ruling erred -- the Sixth Circuit erred in three important ways.   First, the exhaustion requirement does not apply if Petitioner's A -- because the Petitioner's ADA claim seeks relief that is not also available under the IDEA.

First, on QP-1, whether having a purely non-IDEA relief type of claim can proceed, there used to be a circuit split. There was at least at the time the Court granted Fry.   The Tenth Circuit -- I mean, excuse me, the Ninth Circuit, in a case called Payne in 2011, adopted the view that we advocate, and that was I think probably the basis for the Court granting cert in Fry. However, after 10 years living with that rule, the Ninth Circuit en banc has -- has gone the other way.   But, in those 10 years -- remember, the Ninth Circuit is nine states, two territories, and about 20 percent of the U.S. population.   No one has identified a single instance -- maybe there's a few -- of this becoming a problem. And I think that that really touches upon the recognition that the Court had in Rowley, which is parents have every incentive to proceed IDEA relief.   It's a speedy path and concerns the education of their children, where time is of the essence.   They're realistically going to go after IDEA relief and then pursue, as my friend explained, ADA relief later.   And I think the 10 years in the Tenth Circuit without the ability of the other side to identify any problem speaks to that. The second issue is about the settlement.   We've had three circuits that -- as -- as we explained in our invitation brief, that have our rule about futility, the Third Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, and the Tenth Circuit.   And that's been since, in the Third Circuit, 1995.   Again, no untoward results. Again, I think this speaks to the recognition of the Court in Rowley that court -- that parents are going to pursue IDEA relief.

"}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted Section 1415(l), it channeled all FAPE denial claims through the IDEA's exhaustion procedures.   Congress carefully crafted those procedures, and it wanted parents and school districts to go through them because of the primacy of a FAPE. Congress's choice helps answer both questions presented, plus the third that Mr. Perez wants to add. On the first question, Congress's choice shows that the word \"relief\" in 1415(l) means redress for harm, not a specific remedy. When a plaintiff complains of a FAPE denial, relief is available under the IDEA, and the plaintiff must exhaust.   Any other test would allow plaintiffs to circumvent the exhaustion requirement Congress carefully crafted by using the magic word \"damages\" and going straight to court. On the futility question, Congress's choice explains the unusually specific words that Congress wrote.   A plaintiff must exhaust to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under the IDEA.   That directive reflects Congress's focus on delivering a FAPE, and it makes two things clear. One, exhausting a non-IDEA claim means obtaining an administrative decision from an educational expert, just as an IDEA plaintiff must do before going to court.   That's why Mr. Perez's improper new argument that \"settles\" equals \"exhaustion\" is incorrect.   An IDEA plaintiff cannot sue after settling. Thus, neither can a non-IDEA plaintiff. Two, settlement doesn't excuse exhaustion.   Neither the unavailability of damages nor settlement constitutes futility under the IDEA.   Futility may excuse exhaustion where a court can grant relief that a hearing officer can't.   But neither a hearing officer nor a court can award IDEA damages or adjudicate a settled claim.   Thus, to the same extent, neither the unavailability of damages nor settlement constitutes futility for an ADA claim. I welcome the Court's questions.

If the Court adopts Mr. Perez's rule, then school districts could insist, if they wanted to, on a global release, or, if they were willing to proceed with litigation later on in an ADA claim, they could do that as well.

Congress changed that. Two, Smith said no non-IDEA FAPE claims.   And Smith did -- and -- and 1415(l) did overturn that. But the third thing Smith said was that it had a concern with circumventing the IDEA's procedures.

The result of our analysis does allow for non-IDEA FAPE claims to be brought once the IDEA's exhaustion procedures have been -- have been followed. So all we're talking about here is that if you have a FAPE claim, you bring that to the IDEA hearing officer first.   You get a FAPE, which is the primary relief that the IDEA is concerned with.   And once you have that, if you think you have an ADA claim to pursue, you can pursue that some number of months later. But Congress's focus first and foremost was on making sure that the -- that the child gets a With respect to the statutory text, I think all of this comes down to how we interpret or how you interpret the word \"relief\" in 1415(l), and the word \"relief\" read in isolation can mean one of two things.

And is the gravamen of the complaint the denial of a FAPE, whatever you might call it in your complaint, or is it something else? And -- and, in this case, I think using the two guideposts that Fry provides, one, could an adult at a school have brought the same claim? No, because the claim is about the denial of an education.   Could a child at another public facility like a library have brought the same claim? No, for the same reason, because, at bottom, what's alleged here is the denial of a proper education.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, Mr. Dvoretzky, just going back to this question of what \"relief\" means and whether you're seeking relief that's also available under the IDEA when you're seeking damages, I would have thought that the first blush and maybe also the second blush and third blush reading of that is, well, no, if you're seeking damages, then you're not seeking relief that's also available under the IDEA. And that's exactly how the rest of 1415 uses \"relief.\" So that there are a couple of different provisions in the same statutory section.   One says it directs the court to grant such relief as it determines as appropriate.   So, you know, it's like, are you granting an injunction? Are you granting damages? Another prohibits attorneys' fees if the court finds that the relief obtained isn't more favorable to the parents than the offer of settlement.   Again, it's relief in the normal sense.   You know, what did you get? Did you -- how much money did -- was put on the table? It's just a normal wording of the word \"relief,\" the one that comes out of Black's Law Dictionary, that Fry quotes, which is like I'm seeking damages.   That's not relief that's available under the IDEA. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Justice Kagan, I think that \"redress\" can also bear a different meaning, which is not just the specific remedy that you're asking for but redress for a harm. It's the -- it's the kind of situation where you may not get what you ask for, but you get what you need. And if you bring a FAPE denial claim seeking damages to an IDEA hearing officer, you're not going to get damages because the IDEA doesn't give you that, but you will get a FAPE, and that is redress for the harm of denial of a FAPE. With respect to how Fry used the term, Fry said \"relief\" is the redress or benefit that attends a favorable judgment.   It didn't say redress -- the specific redress or benefit demanded by the plaintiff that attends a favorable judgment. With respect to the other uses of \"relief\" in the IDEA, again, I think \"relief\" in isolation can bear different meanings.

"}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Justice Kagan, I respectfully disagree with that reading of the word \"relief\" in the other provisions as well. If you look at those two provisions, one talks about how the court shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.   That's my \"you get what you need, not necessarily what you want\" understanding of relief.   The court will grant whatever relief is appropriate, regardless of what relief you have specifically asked for. The other example is in the settlement context.   No fees if the relief finally obtained is less favorable than the settlement offer. Under Mr. Perez's understanding of relief, what \"relief\" really means is a type of relief.   That doesn't plug in -- that understanding doesn't plug in to that settlement provision.   How do you compare different types of relief as being more or less favorable? It's apples and oranges. And so I -- I don't actually think that playing the isolated definition game of looking at \"relief\" in different contexts gets you very far here.   I think the real question is, what did Congress mean when it used the word \"relief\" in 1415(l) and which of the two plausible understandings of that term did Congress mean to adopt? Our understanding makes more sense here for a few reasons.   One -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Can you, before you go into those reasons, if the question is what did Congress intend, as you started out, how -- how do you respond to opposing counsel's reference to the legislative history and in particular the statement in the House report where Congress says it's not appropriate to require the use of the exhaustion process if an IDEA hearing officer lacks the authority to grant the relief sought? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Justice Jackson, this was a compromise bill that went through a number of different iterations, and I just don't think that there is much, if any, weight that can be placed on the legislative history to shed light on that. I think, if we -- if we look at the purposes that Congress was more broadly trying to achieve here, the main purpose of the IDEA -- and it says this in its first declaration of purpose -- is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a FAPE. The exhaustion requirement is designed to address that FAPE requirement right away. Rather than -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " For IDEA claims. But what about the purposes of the other non-IDEA statutes which Congress is clearly preserving here? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Congress is preserving them, but the second half of 1415(l) channels those through the IDEA's exhaustion procedures. And the reason for that is because of the primacy of getting a FAPE under the IDEA. The exhaustion requirement is designed to say, you can pursue your other claims later, but, first and foremost, you have to try to get a FAPE because that's what's in the best interests of the child.   And you have to go through the IDEA's procedures in order to do that, rather than allowing parents to choose a particular remedy that they might prefer under other statutes by going straight to court. Fry, I think, also reflects that insight in that it recognizes the primacy of the FAPE in asking whether the gravamen of a complaint is the denial of the FAPE. Reading \"relief\" to mean the redress that the IDEA provides also avoids a circumvention problem because circumvention and going straight to court may, first of all, deprive the child of a FAPE by focusing on damages and not requiring parents to go through -- through the FAPE process. Second, it deprives both parents and schools of help from educational experts, which Article III judges are not.   I think Congress recognized that there are educational experts in the agencies who ought to address these sorts of issues first. And, third, by putting -- it would -- the circumvention and going straight to court would put the FAPE question before inexpert Article III judges without the benefit of getting findings in a decision, which is what the IDEA's exhaustion procedures require, from an educational expert.

As to that rule, that -- that's not a default rule principle at play there.   That would be an absolute rule outside the context of settlement.

It just wasn't present in the particular case you mentioned because the party didn't argue it.   So, again, what's wrong with the futility exception as interpreted by most circuits, including my former circuit? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " I -- there is no futility exception that applies in this situation because of how 1415(l) operates.   The -- the rule -- what the Court needs to look at is whether an IDEA claim would be subject to a futilities -- futility exception.   In other words, if this FAPE-related ADA claim or FAPE denial ADA claim had been brought as an IDEA claim, would there be a futility exception to that IDEA claim? And the answer to that question is no. The relevant principle of exhaustion, exhaustion is excused as futile when the agency can't grant you some relief that a court could grant you.   That's the circumstance in which it makes sense to say we're going to excuse exhaustion, we're going to allow you to skip over the first-level decisionmaker and go straight to a second-level decisionmaker who can help you. That principle doesn't apply either as to a damages request or in the settlement context for an IDEA claim.   A damages request can't excuse exhaustion as futile because neither a hearing officer nor a court can award damages under the IDEA.   The problem is that the IDEA doesn't authorize damages in the first place, not that the hearing officer is somehow uniquely powerless to grant them. Settlement also can't excuse exhaustion as futile.   Futility and exhaustion are concepts that really only make sense as preparation for a lawsuit.   But, when a plaintiff settles his IDEA claim, he extinguishes it.   Futility excuses exhaustion so someone can go to court.   When the case has been settled, no one's going to court. So, no -- whatever futility exceptions there might be in other contexts in the IDEA, those futility exceptions don't logically apply when you have a request for damages or a settlement.

And so whether it's an emotional distress claim, whether it's a lost income claim, I don't think that there are meaningful damages that would be available under the ADA given the state of the law right now. But, yes, that sort of claim could be brought after exhaustion of the -- the ID -- of -- of -- of the procedures in (f) and (g). "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Can I ask you the same -- maybe the same question as the hypothetical just so that I understand because I think I'm a little confused? So suppose we have a student who has both a viable IDEA claim and a viable ADA claim arising out of the same facts, which is the school is not giving her what she needs to get an appropriate education.   But, for whatever reason, she only wants to bring the claim for money damages.   Maybe she's going into her senior year, she's given up on education and she wants to go to work, so she doesn't want any of the, you know, adjust my education, give me the actual accommodations.   She just wants to drop out and go to work and get compensatory damages for the harm that's been caused, she says, by the school's neglect under the ADA. Does she have to exhaust using the procedures in this statute or not? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " I think she does, but, in order to answer that question, I also have to just challenge one premise of it, which is I think that in -- generally speaking, even after you have graduated, you can still get redress for the denial of a FAPE through the IDEA in -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But not compensatory damages.   She doesn't want any of the injunctive relief related to the circumstances of education.   So whatever the relief is that she could have gotten from the hearing officer about the state or status of her educational circumstances she disclaims.   All she wants is to be compensated for what she says occurred to her during the period of her education.   And so she says: I don't want to bring an IDEA claim, I have an ADA claim. Does she have to sit in front of the hearing officer and talk about ways in which her education could be changed, et cetera? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Yes.

She doesn't -- she's saying: I'm 18, I don't have to go to school anymore, I don't want to go to school anymore, I'm dropping out, I just want compensatory damages under the ADA. What I'm trying to understand is why do we have a statute in your view that would make her exhaust under the IDA -- the IDEA, as if she was asking for that other form of relief? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Because whatever her preference is as to damages, Congress's priority in enacting the ADA and in -- as reflected in 1415(l) was first and foremost to make sure that people get a FAPE. And so the remedy that she would get for the denial of a FAPE may not be immediately her first choice.   She might -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And you don't see yourself as reading out the first part of the statute that says nothing about this limits the person's remedies or rights under the non-IDEA statute? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " I -- I don't, because the second part of 1415(l) starts out by saying except that, before the filing of a civil action.   So the first half is preserving some remedies, but the second half is by its terms creating a carveout, and that carveout requires FAPE-related claims to be channeled through the IDEA.   That may result in a situation, as I say, where the plaintiff doesn't get right off the bat whatever their first-choice specific remedy is.   They get what the IDEA provides. They have to wait six months or however long it takes to then go to court and seek damages, but Congress's goal in passing the IDEA was to make sure that people get FAPEs, and Congress's prioritization and sequencing of IDEA and non-IDEA claims in 1415(l) reflect that. With respect to -- if I can go back to Justice Alito's earlier question, which I think was, if we are in the world of default rules as to the settlement issue, why is our default rule preferable for that situation? I think a couple of points.   One, our default rule leads to global settlement. Global settlement is generally preferred.   It is generally preferred because, once the parties have agreed on a FAPE, the parents and the school still have to continue to cooperate and working together in that -- work together in that situation.   And so having global peace rather than having separate litigation, if you're looking for a default rule, is the better default rule. Second, if you are going to have subsequent litigation, Congress's preference was for that to be informed by an administrative finding -- by administrative findings and decision and the expertise of the -- the educational experts who are involved in the IDEA process.   And so, if we have to have a default rule, the default rule ought to be against subsequent litigation without that expertise. Third, this is just how the -- the text operates with the somewhat peculiar language of 1415(l).   To Justice Thomas's point earlier, I'm not aware of another statute that subjects one -- that subjects a claim under one statute to exhaustion procedures under another, but that by its plain terms is what 1415(l) is doing.   So our default rule honors that text. If you were to create an exception to that, it would potentially open the flood gates to other sorts of exceptions to futility or exhaustion that one might seek, and that's going to lead to uncertainty and further litigation in the lower courts. And, lastly, on the equities, as I was saying to Justice Barrett, in light of the state of the law right now, it -- it's not clear that there even are compensatory damages available under the ADA.   And so there is no great inequity in holding as a default rule that once you have gotten the FAPE, which was Congress's, again, primary purpose in enacting the IDEA, once you've gotten that, at that point, you have gotten -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, no, no one's decided that question yet, Mr. Dvoretzky.   So, while those damages remain open and potentially available, the question is, you know, what should Miguel have done?

What should Miguel have done differently from what he did do in this case? "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " I think a plaintiff in that situation has several options.   One is, as part of the settlement, to negotiate whatever compensation he thinks he's entitled to for his non-IDEA claims. Another is to negotiate as part of the settlement a waiver from the school of the exhaustion requirement and then proceed to court.   So there were options as part of that global settlement to get -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- but, you know -- "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " -- the full relief he was asking for.

Just pound his fist on the table with your legal rule such that Sturgis doesn't have to offer any of those things because he can't -- he has two choices.   He can either reject a good settlement which is enabling him to receive educational services or give up on the potential, which this statute clearly gives him, of getting compensatory damages as well under the ADA. "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Justice Kagan, I think that takes us back to the default rule point, which is whichever rule this Court adopts, either side could, if it wanted, pound its fist on the table and insist on one outcome or another. Either you can -- either a plaintiff can insist on getting full recovery or a waiver or a school district could insist if it wanted to on no deal unless it gets a waiver.   I mean, I'm sorry, unless it gets a full release. The other point that I'll make as a practical matter, though, and I think it's also true in this case, although these facts haven't been developed because the -- the case hasn't been litigated, school districts have an interest in starting to provide the FAPE as soon as they are aware and as soon as their lawyers make their aware -- make them aware that there has been some deficiency.   It's not in a school district's interests to say we're going to hold the FAPE hostage. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But parents also have an interest in that, and that suggests why your sort of the sky is falling isn't going to happen, because, of course, parents are not going to bypass the process that gives them most speedily, most inexpensively, the opportunity to get the education fixed.

Having spoken -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I don't know that your view of how school districts are going to operate is always going to be true.

I absolutely -- absolutely think that that's right. I think part of the reason that we have not seen a rush to the courthouse seeking just damages claims, bypassing the IDEA, is that the circuits have been aligned, that there's been a circuit consensus in favor of our rule on the first question presented that you can't do that if you're going to court and you're seeking damages for what is fundamentally a denial of FAPE claim. And so, when we talk about whether the sky is falling in the real world, the reason that it hasn't been is that the lower courts have aligned around the rule that we're asking this Court to adopt in the first question. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " But what about Mr. Yang's point that the majority rule in the circuits is that the futility exception applies?

Where a school district wants to challenge the \"stay put\" provision because of a dangerous child, you might have futility that lets you go straight to court.

But, again, I think that's just what follows from Fry, that however you frame your complaint, whether you call it a FAPE denial claim or not, we ask, what at bottom are you actually seeking? And that's where the two questions of Fry are helpful because they ask, could a student at the school -- I'm sorry, could an adult at the school have brought the same claim? Could a student at another public facility have brought the same claim? If the answer is yes -- if the answer is yes, then, in that situation, you are not actually seeking a FAPE denial.   But, if the answer to those questions is no, then whatever you call it, the relief that you're seeking is relief for the denial of a FAPE.   It's my broken arm example.

I mean, what Fry said was, look, if you're not objecting to the denial of a FAPE at all, then you're obviously outside the sphere of the exhaustion requirement.   And then it said: And then there's another question, which is, if you're seeking relief for that denial of a FAPE that's not available under the IDEA, i.e., if you're seeking compensatory damages, which everybody understood not to be available under the IDEA.

That's all. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank -- "}, {"speaker": "Shay Dvoretzky", "text": " Fry recognized those principles. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Martinez? "}, {"speaker": "Roman Martinez", "text": " Your Honors, I think Sturgis's answer to Justice Kagan's question about Miguel's dilemma really gives away the game here.   Their answer is that if Sturgis had refused to cave in, had refused to give Miguel more than it had already negotiated, Miguel would have had to reject the settlement, turn down the immediate FAPE relief, and roll the dice in an IDEA proceeding that might risk not only his recovery but also his attorneys' fees. No way.   That's not what this statute is about. And I think what that answer shows is what Sturgis is really seeking here is a rule that's going to nullify ADA rights and it's going to resurrect the regime of Smith versus Robinson that Congress expressly rejected. A couple of additional points. With respect to the text, their interpretation of \"relief\" means that if I go and I file an ADA claim and a complaint and it says in the complaint that I do not want injunctive relief or any other relief that's available under the IDEA, in their view, my complaint is still seeking relief that is available under the ADA. That can't possibly be right.   It's inconsistent with the dictionaries, inconsistent with Fry, inconsistent with the legislative history, and it's inconsistent with common sense. So they don't have a good textual argument, so they fall back to policy.   But policy can't beat text, and it certainly can't beat text here when their circumvention argument doesn't work.   Miguel settled and received full FAPE relief.   He did not circumvent anything, number one. Number two, in other cases, parents are not going to have an incentive to circumvent because they're going to have to give up all the IDEA relief that they would otherwise be -- have available to them.   The ADA claim is going to be harder to prove. They're just not going to do that.   They're going to try to maintain and preserve their rights under both statutes. With respect to policy, our rule makes much more sense than their rule.   It avoids a pointless exercise in which you have to go to an IDEA hearing officer and ask for relief that the IDEA hearing officer has no authority to give, and it avoids the result in this case where, as we've said repeatedly, Miguel did everything right.   He settled, he got the FAPE, and he nonetheless, on their view, has to give up his ADA claims. With respect to the default rule point, Mr. Dvoretzky for the first time says that oh, what -- what everyone knows you should have had to do is negotiate a waiver of the exhaustion requirement.   Well, that's asking a lot for parents who are struggling with kids with disabilities to -- to have to negotiate that fine-tuned a waiver, and it's also not clear that it's even available. There's a circuit split right now on the question of whether exhaustion is, in fact, jurisdictional.   So, if that rule is in effect, I don't know what parents are supposed to do in circuits that say you can't make such a waiver. At a minimum, it's going to mean that this Court is going to have to decide another case involving this provision.   I don't think that makes any sense. Finally, with respect to purpose, Mr. Dvoretzky says this is all about the primacy of a FAPE.   Of course, the IDEA is about the primacy of a FAPE.   That's exactly what Miguel did when he invoked his IDEA rights, went to the IDEA process, and convinced the -- the Sturgis, after having discriminated against him for 12 years, finally convinced the school to give him a FAPE. That was the settlement that he reached.   The IDEA is also intended, though, to protect other legal rights, and Congress did not intend to force parents of Miguel and other victims of discrimination to give up those rights in order to reach settlements. We ask this Court to reverse.   Thank you, Your Honors. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
