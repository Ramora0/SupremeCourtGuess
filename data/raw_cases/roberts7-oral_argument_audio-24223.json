[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 15-866, Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands. Mr. Bursch. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress did not intend to grant a century-long copyright monopoly in cheerleader uniform design.   And there are three points that support that conclusion. First, by subjecting two-dimensional pictures and graphics as well as sculptures to Section 101 separability test, Congress made clear that two-dimensional and three-dimensional designs must be analyzed for separability. Second, under Section 101's text, the dispositive questions are twofold: Whether the deign features can be identified separately from the useful article's utilitarian aspects; and second, whether they can exist independently, that is, the design features do not add to or change the useful article's utilitarian -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Why, in this case, would we even need to get to any question of separability? What was submitted was a two-dimensional artwork.   It may not be like Mondrian, but it is chevrons and other things. They are not submitting the cheerleader's uniform itself.   They are not saying anything about the shape of the uniform, the cut of the uniform.   They are just saying these zigzag designs -- and you can choose from five different ones that are interchangeable, the design. So why isn't this a -- a case of not -- not part -- the pictorial graphic element is not part of the design of the cheerleader's uniform; it's superimposed on it.   It's reproduced on it.   It's applied to it. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " There two reasons, Justice Ginsburg.   First, consider the example where you have a designer who designs a military uniform.   And on that military uniform, they design the best desert camouflage that's been ever designed in the history of the world. And they submit it to the copyright office, and they don't claim the design in the uniform, they only claim copyright in the design on the uniform. There is no question they would have the copyright in the design, but the courts would still look to see whether that adds to the utilitarian aspects of that uniform such that that design copyright holder could not prevent the military from producing a military uniform that uses that design. That's why it's so important to understand that in Section 101, not only two-dimensional -- or three-dimensional, but also two-dimensional designs are subject to separability. And there's a second reason, Justice Ginsburg.   What you're referring to, generally, is kind of the area of fabric design.   And a good example of fabric design is the -- the flowers on the fabric in the Folio Impressions case that we reprint on page 7 of our reply brief. And those flowers, you could expand the design, you could contract the design, you can make any article of clothing out of it whatsoever, you could rotate it 45 degrees, and it always works functionally the same. Here, when you're talking about these cheerleader uniform designs, the arrangement of the color blocks and the chevrons and the stripes, if you made it smaller and put it in the center of a uniform, it would no longer have the slimming effects.   It wouldn't make the wearer look taller.   I mean, if you put it on a hat or a lunch box, it wouldn't have those functions. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But they have put it on those other items.   That's their whole point, that they've taken the pictorial design and applied it not just to a -- by the way, this is not conceding, I think, by them.   They'll talk on their own and tell me -- that this isn't obvious and -- and some of your amici brief seemed to take that position, that if all we're looking at is a picture of this color blocks and stripes, that it may be too obvious to qualify for copyright protection, or not original enough, whatever. But my point is that they already have done that.   They've taken the designs and not put it on a cheerleading uniform.   They've put it on sweats. They've put it on both tops and bottoms. So what does that do for you? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Let me respond to both of those points, that the obvious in the second; first, the other garments. To the extent they're putting it on other garments, if you look closely at those pictures, the design changes.   It's not the same design anymore.   And to the extent that it remains similar, it's because, for example, the warmup jackets are putting those lines in the same place. So the great example of this is on page 21 of the Fromer and Buccafusco brief, where it is the Stella McCartney dresses on Kate Winslet.   And she's got those slimming, dark lines along the sides that change how she is perceived.   It makes her shape look different to someone who is looking at her, and the lines on these uniforms do the exact same thing. Similarly, you've got in -- in these uniforms you've got the waist-narrowing Vs on the sides. It creates the optical illusion that the wearer is thinner than they actually are, slimmer.   You've got the M\u00fcller-Lyer lines -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How could you copyright anything under your use of \"utility,\" under your definition of \"utility\"? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Because my definition -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Every form -- I suspect in most cases, every form gives something else, an attractiveness, to the purchaser.   That's why you have designs of anything, even pictorial designs. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " We completely agree.   And that's why it's so important that you focus on the statutory text, because under the exists-independently requirement that we cite -- this is right from Section 101 -- the feature cannot add to or change the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the \"useful article.\" So let's say that I've got a T-shirt with a happy face on it, and maybe that makes me look better because I appear happier.   Well, that design has the same effect whether I'm wearing it on my shirt, my pants, my hat, or carrying it on my notebook. But here, these designs only work when they're on the article for which they are designed in the exact place where they were designed. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Suppose you have a Picasso painting or Mondrian or Klee, and suppose they're alive and they licensed the use of their picture on a garment and it does just what you say: This Picasso painting or Mondrian just completely captures the shape of the article you want.   The fact that it completely captures it means that it can be copied? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " No, it does not, because the Picasso -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " What's the difference between Mondrian or Picasso and these -- and these lines? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Because I could take the Picasso and I could just have it in a frame on the chest, or I could expand it to the entire breadth of the uniform. With these designs, it has -- the side lines have to be right here.   The Vs have to be right here. The M\u00fcller-Lyer line has to be right here.   And if you would move it, say rotate that 45 degrees, you can do that with the Picasso and it would still look like a Picasso.   If you turned one of these designs 45 degrees, it would no longer make the cheerleader look taller and thinner. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " How is your argument different from this tuxedo shirt that the government talks about -- it's on page 10 of the government's brief -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- where the lines really do have to be just in a particular place on the piece of apparel in order for it to make any sense at all and, in there, that was found to be copyrightable? Is that -- is there -- there any difference between the tuxedo shirt and this? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Well, there are differences, and I think even the government would tell you, if you asked them that question, that that design wouldn't prevent you from making the tuxedo.   And what we're talking about here is making the cheerleader uniform, the actual three-dimensional cheerleader uniform that you wear, and that's the lesson of one Section -- or Section 113. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " No.   But it prevents you -- it prevents you from making this T-shirt with these lines on it in the same way that you're saying nobody should be able to make a short dress -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Right.   And the point -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- with those particular lines in that particular place. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " The point is you can have a copyright in that design.   We don't contest that Varsity has a copyright in the design.   We wouldn't contest in the hypothetical I used with Justice Ginsburg you could have a copyright in the camouflage design.   But that copyright doesn't extend to prevent you from making the useful article depicted.   That's where the line stops. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So I guess I'm not sure about your -- does that mean if you can have a copyright in the tuxedo shirt design that somebody couldn't draw a tuxedo shirt because that's copyrighted two-dimensional? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Correct, right.   You could not replicate the design, but you could make the tuxedo. That's the lesson of Jack Adelman in Section 1. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But you're saying you couldn't make the tuxedo shirt -- is that correct? -- or you could? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " You could not.   Let's take it back to the cheerleader uniform, and then bring it back to the text of the statute. We don't contest that Varsity could take these designs and put it on a notebook, put it on a lunchbox, put it on a hat, and no one could copy that. That's clearly within the subject matter of their copyright. What they can't do is prevent someone from making the entire uniform.   And the reason the statute requires that is because you have this identified-separately requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So are you suing them just for the pictures that are in their catalogue? Is that what you're suing them for? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " We're not suing them; they're suing us. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry.   You're right.   I apologize. So can you get -- you could stop them from using their pictures of their uniforms in their catalogue -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- but you can't stop them from selling their -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " We can't stop them from using their copyright to do anything on a printed page, or even to take these designs and, like I said, put it on a lunchbox or a notebook.   But their copyright does not -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I transposed the two of you.   I apologize. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " No problem, Justice Sotomayor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can -- are they stopping you from -- you think you can sell your uniforms anywhere. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what can't you do? If we don't agree with you, if we agree with them that this is a -- eligible for copyright absent some other disqualification, like obviousness or lack of creativity or whatever else, okay, assume we agree with them; what can they stop you from doing? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Well, actually, if you agree with them that they have a copyright, then you're agreeing with us, too, because we all agree they have a copyright in the sketch. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " They have a copyright in the image.   Our position is that they cannot then take that image and prohibit us from making the actual three-dimensional uniform.   And the reason for that under Section 101 is because the design neither can be identified separately, nor can exist independently, which are the statutory requirements of the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the cheerleader uniform. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So but if I could just go back and make sure I understand my question about the tuxedo shirt. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If I have a copyright in the design of the tuxedo shirt, not in a tuxedo -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- I have a copyright in the design of a tuxedo shirt, can I prevent other people from manufacturing tuxedo shirts? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So why isn't that exactly the same? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Because -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Because here, I have a design in a copyright dress, and now I'm trying to prevent other people from manufacturing that cheerleader dress with that design. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Because then that's like manufacturing the tuxedo.   And what Section 113(b) says is that all of the copyright law with respect to this kind of issue, that was -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I don't understand why it's like manufacturing a tuxedo.   It seems as though it's like manufacturing the thing that I have the design in. I have design in the -- I have a design of a tuxedo shirt, so you can't make a tuxedo shirt.   I have a design in a cheerleader dress, so you can't make the cheerleader dress. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " It has to do with the very careful statutory requirement that they exist independently.   What that means is the feature can't add to or change the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the article. When you're talking about the tuxedo design, it's not adding anything functional to the T-shirt. It's simply putting a design on it.   When you're talking about these designs on a cheerleader uniform, it advances a number of utilitarian designs, and let me just tick those off quickly. First, it changes how the wearer is perceived through optical illusion.   And that's some of the things that I've been referring to: the slimming lines on the side, the waist-narrowing Vs, the M\u00fcller-Lyer lines -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Is that the same for all five of the -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " All five.   And I'll tick through this list, and then let's look at the uniforms and I can show you how they do that. The second, like all uniforms, Justice Kagan, it actually identifies the cheerleader as a cheerleader, which was Judge McKeague's point, Judge Cleland's point below.   Because if these cheerleaders were wearing wrestling singlets, no one would identify them as cheerleaders. And uniforms have a special identification function.   You think about military people who are in a scene mixed up with civilians, and it's the military uniforms that identify them as members of the military that tells you whether the rules of war apply to them or not. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I thought conveying information doesn't make an article useful. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " I don't think that optical illusions are conveying information.   I don't think that identification is conveying optical illusion. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, you said -- you said a function of the cheerleader -- cheerleader's dress is to identify the person as a cheerleader. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes.   That's a second function. So let me first make clear, the optical illusions isn't conveying information; it's actually causing you to see the person differently than they actually are.   So at a minimum, that doesn't fall within this. I think with the identification, that allows you to sort people.   That's different than conveying information like facts and figures. In addition, Your Honor, the conveyance of information is actually something that has to be considered as part of the exists-independently prong. And you can see this on page 2 of the blue brief where we have Section 101, both the \"pictorial graphic\" and \"sculptural works\" definition and the \"useful article\" definition. And if you start with the \"useful article\" definition, to determine whether something is a useful article in the first instance, you ask whether it has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information. So portraying the appearance and conveying information are utilitarian functions, but if that's the only thing that they do, then it's not a useful article. But once you've decided that a garment like a cheerleader uniform is a useful article, now you turn to the separability test.   So now we look at the PGS definition right above the \"useful article\" definition, and there you are measuring the features against the utilitarian aspects of the article. It doesn't say only the intrinsic utilitarian functions; it's any \"utilitarian aspect.\" So having made the first decision, yes, this garment is a useful article, the statute requires us to consider all the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the article. And -- and that has to be the case or otherwise, again, military uniforms, their identifying functions, you could have lay people making military uniform designs and barring the government from ever being able to manufacture those uniforms themselves, even if everyone agrees that that is a useful thing. Two other quick things on functionality. These designs also define the uniform's style line and their actual three-dimensional shape. So, Justice Kagan, the -- the zigzag that they have on the bottom of 299A and 299B on page 4 of our -- our blue brief, it's actually defining the shape, and everyone agrees that the shape of a uniform can never be copyrighted.   There is no dispute about that. The last thing -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I thought that the -- the shape was the same on all of these.   We have different designs, five different designs, same shape. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " No.   The -- maybe this would be a good time to turn to the pictures on pages 4 to 5 of the blue brief, because these are the actual copyright deposits involved.   And what you can see -- I'll give you a moment to pull up pages 4 and 5 of the blue brief. On page 4, you have two of the deposits. This is 299A on the bottom, 299B on the top, and that zigzag actually defines the shape.   And it also has the functional utility of covering up the seams and making that waistband stronger, not allowing it to stretch when the cheerleader puts it on and off. The stripes at the top that define the shape of the collar, again, that's not copyrightable, also cover up seams. That stripe that goes across diagonally right there that separates the white color block from the red color block, those two color blocks have to be stitched together, and what they do is they put those stitches on the outside so that it'll be smooth on the inside where the cheerleader is, and they have to cover up those sales with a stripe.   So all these things are -- are functional. So now let's look -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So do you get a different -- a different result if, instead of stitched, the design is applied? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " If it's -- it's subliminated, which is something that they -- they've talked about. It's no different with respect to the optical illusion or the identifying function, because if you print the same design in a cheerleader uniform, you'd have to print it exactly the same way they stitch it. Let's focus now on page 5.   The bottom drawing there is number 815.   This is the red one with the blue stripes that go down the side.   It's those blue stripes on the side, just like the Stella McCartney dress, that cause the cheerleader to be perceived as slimmer and more curvy than they actually are. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Mr. Bursch, I go back to this point, because I'm a little confused.   You started by saying to me you don't want to be stopped from manufacturing this particular uniform. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What do they -- what do you think they have a copyright in? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " They have a copyright -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Or the -- what do you think is eligible for copyright in this picture? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " I think the copyright eligibility in this picture is the design, so long as it's not being used to prevent the manufacturer of the useful article that it was intended to be -- to appear on. Like I said, they -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Isn't that the government's position too? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Well, I -- I think they agree with us on that point.   If you look at -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " On that point. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yeah.   If you look at page 22 and 23 of their brief, they have our little black dress, and then they have this very design here, number 815, and they explain that if we are right that this design has functionality -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what can't you do, assuming that you accept what they have a copyright in, sort of the -- this thing, but not in stopping the manufacture of the uniform -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- what do you think their copyright stops you from doing? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Everything else.   We could not print this on a notebook cover.   We couldn't put it on a lunch pail.   We couldn't put it on a hat.   The -- the only thing it allows us to do is to actually produce the useful article itself. And I -- I'm -- I'm talking so much about cheerleader uniforms.   I want to focus back on the text just for a moment because the purpose of having a separability test under Section 101 is to make sure that anything that enhances in any way the functionality of a useful article is not within the subject matter of copyright. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I guess that's the question, is it really in any way, because the opposite way of reading this statute is that the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the article that you're talking about in terms of the separability test? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That -- that those \"utilitarian aspects\" should be understood to encompass only the utilitarian functions that make something a useful article in the first place, which means that they should be held to exclude things that relate to the -- portraying the appearance of the article or things that relates to conveying information, and that seems to me a pretty good -- I mean, it's a confusing statute, but it seems to me a pretty good holistic understanding of this statute. But that is what this statute is trying to do, is to say there are certain kinds of things that might in a broad sense be considered utilitarian, which has to do with portraying appearance or conveying information, that, for this inquiry, we want you to exclude, that the separability test does not relate to those kinds of things. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " And, Justice Kagan, that would be a possible policy that Congress could have adopted, but that's not what the statute says. When you're applying the separability test, you're comparing the features to the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the article, not the intrinsic utilitarian function.   Not the ones that made it a useful article, but all \"utilitarian aspects\" of the article.   And -- and if you excluded things like uniform's identifying functions, then someone would be able to prevent the military from producing camouflage uniforms if they got to that design first, and that's exactly the opposite of what Congress intended. You know, in fact, there has been a hundred years of proposed legislation where people have tried -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But the reason why camouflage is such a good example for your side is that camouflage actually -- we can understand it as having a utilitarian function that is different from simply conveying information and it is different from simply making something appear a certain way. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " In other words, the utilitarian function that camouflage has is to hide you in the woods. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And so -- so that function would not be excluded by these things. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Right, but the utilitarian function of the fabric only works -- of the design only works in conjunction with the useful article, and the same is true here.   When you talk about camouflage, it's creating an optical illusion, right? We've got that picture on page 1 of our reply brief, and when you first look at that, you don't immediately see that there is a person standing in that tree because they are camouflaged. Well, in the same way with these cheerleader-uniform designs, it creates the optical illusion that they are taller, that they're slimmer, that they're -- they're curvier.   You know, all these functions work exactly the same way as camouflage. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Forget the special things. I have a picture of a dress now.   The dress is in my mind.   I have abstracted it.   When I look at those forms in space, it looks like a dress. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   Now, you'd say, I take it, that when I've tried to identify the design separately, I've ended up with something that is not capable of existing independently of the -- of the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the dress, because it looks like a dress.   So when Marcel Duchamp has a shovel on the wall and says it's a work of art, he can have a copyright as long as he doesn't try to sue people who make shovels. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's it. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " That is the \"identified separately\" portion of our argument.

Bursch", "text": " Yes, but the -- the part of your description that makes me nervous is when you talk about, I'm just imagining something, because that's the \"side-by-side\" test that Varsity advances.   That you have to just imagine and visualize whether two things can be conceived of -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, why not?

Breyer", "text": " All right.   And this -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " -- of the \"utilitarian aspects.\" And so -- so then you lose the utility.   You know, they would say under their test that -- that here, because I can conceptualize this uniform separate from the fabric, that that's enough.   But -- but it's not, because if that design is doing work on the fabric in the place where it was designed to be, then utilitarian function is lost when you remove it.   And that's exactly what Section 101 requires, right? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " True, true. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " So you have to look not only at the design; you have to look at the article as well. And if the article does less work when that thing is gone, it's not separable.

For a hundred and more-than-that years, the fashion industry has not enjoyed copyright protection.   It is an industry on the women's side, I believe, that 225 billion dollars, at least, worth of clothes are sold every year.   If suddenly in this case we say that dresses are copyrightable, and they are because every one of them has some design, perhaps we'll double the price of women's clothes.

If you look in the amicus brief of Professors Buccafusco and Fromer, they have in their illustration number one is the fresco painted on the dome of a church.   And they say that's not copyright-eligible because it uses techniques to make the dome look bigger.

You can't get a copyright in an idea.   That's 102(b). The merger doctrine, not this utilitarian separability analysis that we've been talking about, the merger doctrine is the primary way in which courts and the Copyright Office can, you know, prevent the owner of a copyright from locking up the ways of expressing a particular idea.

We do think that the two-dimensional artwork here is separable from the garment, the cut and shape of which is not copyrightable.   Let me just make a couple of points. One is about the act and what it's doing overall.   The act overall is drawing a distinction between the kinds of aesthetic communicative expressive functions that are traditionally protected by copyright and the kinds of mechanical, pragmatic, utilitarian functions that are exclusively the domain of a \"useful article.\" And the kinds of functions that Mr. Bursch is talking about here are fundamentally expressive functions. First of all, conveying the information that someone is a cheerleader.   When someone is wearing a particular piece of clothing intended to convey that they're a member of a particular group or that they hold a particular belief, that is the kind of expressive function that copyright traditionally protects. And, indeed, there is an express exception in the definition of a \"useful article\" for conveying information.   And I think this is indistinguishable from putting a sports team logo on a T-shirt to identify someone as a Washington Capitals fan, for instance. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, what do you do in Mr. Bursch's examples of military uniforms or police officer uniforms, something like that? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " So, Your Honor, those also are conveying information.   Now, if someone were trying to assert a copyright in the design of a policeman uniform in such a way that it turned out there were, say, only a limited number of ways to identify someone as a policeman and a copyright were being asserted to prevent identification of someone as a policeman, then the defenses that we discuss at pages 39 to 40 of our brief, the \"merger\" doctrine, the \"sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire\" doctrine, would apply to prevent what would effectively be monopolization of that idea. So if that were really happening in this case -- and there are some reasons to think that's not actually happening in the cheerleading realm, and we discuss those in our brief -- if that were happening, those defenses would apply.

Feigin", "text": " Well, Your Honor, we -- we don't agree with the result in the Galiano case.   To the extent there was some sort of unique, two-dimensional elements that some casino wanted to put on its uniforms to identify its employees, that artwork would be copyrightable and -- just like the cheerleading uniforms in this case. I also want to address the argument -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, before you get away from that, one thing very quick, because maybe I really agree with you. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " I hope so. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I had looked at page 22 of your brief at figure 8.   And what I had seen there when I took the arms away was a picture of a thing that was a picture of the cut and style and not just a picture of chevrons.   And so -- but if that's what it is, then you would agree and I would agree that it's not -- everybody would agree, I guess, it's not copyrightable. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " The point of figure 7 and 8 in our brief, Your Honor, is that everything you see in figure 7 that's also in figure 8 is not copyrightable. That's the cut and shape of the dress.   It's the stripes and the coloration, the lines and the design in this particular arrangement. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So what happens if when you look at the picture that they submit to the Copyright Office and try to figure out if it's separable what you see is a picture of a dress that goes around a woman which does look like, you know, shape and cut and so forth? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " So they have generally checked a box, as they did here, that says two-dimensional artwork, and the Copyright Office understands all they're trying to protect is the surface imagery of the garment, and that, they'll register. I do want to address this idea that making the viewer look different is somehow the kind of non-expressive function that is associated with the \"useful article\" -- with a \"useful article.\" And I think that approach would be contrary to congressional intent and completely inadministrable. If you look at page 55 of the House report, you'll see that Congress believed that two-dimensional designs on fabric or on wallpaper would be separable and thus copyrightable.   But that wouldn't be true under the approach petitioner is urging. Under that approach, you'd have to look at a particular two-dimensional design on wallpaper and try to assess whether and to what degree it might make the room look bigger or brighter or smaller or darker.   I'm not aware of any scientific reliable or consistent way -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, that seems a problem. But on the other hand, it seems a little bit strange that, you know, take a garment designer who wants to do a design that is slimming.   And if -- there are all kinds of structural things you can do that are slimming, and those would not be copyrightable. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Then you're saying that the -- that the placement of stripes or color, that is copyrightable, even though the garment designer is really trying to do the same thing through color and through graphic design as he was doing through the shape of the article. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " So, Your Honor, I definitely think there is a spectrum here, but let me try to explain why I think this is on the expressive side of the line, not the non-expressive side of the line. If I were to wear a shirt that said \"Please focus on my very nicely toned arms.   I've worked very hard on them,\" I think we'd all understand the message conveyed by that shirt to be expressive and separable from the non-expressive functions that the shirt performs covering my body. Now, what -- the kinds of things that we're talking about here are essentially sending that same message, albeit in a nonverbal, more subconscious way, but they're still fundamentally expressive because they're about how the wearer is trying to portray themselves and their appearance to the world, and that's all that's being copyrighted.   That's traditionally within the domain of copyright.   It is not copyrighting a particular functionality. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Is the domain of copyright to copyright the way people present themselves to the world? "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " The way that someone expresses -- the way that someone expresses an idea to the world -- in this case, the idea would be how they look -- is something that is very akin to traditional expression that's protected by copyright. Again, here we're just talking about two-dimensional artwork.   If we were -- if we adopted petitioner's view, the Copyright Office, when it looks at a particular two-dimensional design, would have to figure out what effect it would have in all sorts of contexts on various \"useful articles,\" which would really -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " The whole point of the case is we're not just talking about two-dimensional artwork.   We're talking about two-dimensional artwork applied to a -- the fabric in a way that conveys a utilitarian function.   It's not just -- your friend concedes that if you want to put a picture of this on a lunchbox or whatever that you have a copyright in that. It's only when you apply it to a garment -- because it is what makes that garment a cheerleading outfit as opposed to somebody else; it serves that utilitarian function -- that you don't have a copyright. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " Your Honor, I think our fundamental disagreement is whether this is actually performing utilitarian functions.   If I could just -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Eric J. Feigin", "text": " -- finish my response. And I think one -- I think one problem with the approach you've just articulated is it really divorces Section 101 and 113(a) because you could get a copyright in the illustration, and then he would say it's not copyrightable in certain applications, and that doesn't make much sense. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch, six minutes. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to start with that final point that the government makes, that if you had a statement that says look at my arms on your shirt that somehow that would be conveying the same message.   That -- that's not what this is doing.   No one is saying, look at my arms. Like with camouflage, you're not saying, look, you can't see me. The camouflage is actually doing work when it's put in connection with the garment that it was designed for.   That's the point. And on that point, Justice Kagan, I just want to make clear about the functionality that we are claiming here with respect to these designs.   It's not just that the lines follow the figure of the human body. It's that they actually make the human body appear to look different than it would if they were not wearing those designs.   It's just like camouflage. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But the colors do.   I mean, the colors are just colors.   You can -- what he is saying is you can achieve the same thing with probably most colors and stripes and whatever else is in these designs. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Well, they are not claiming copyright in the colors.   They -- they can't -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, they are not. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " -- the arrangement. And I would say even as to color, this Court in the Qualitex case, that was a trademark case, you said that black, the color black has the ability to make a motor look smaller than it actually is.   It has a function that makes it ineligible for trademark protection, and, really, that's the same thing that we are talking about here.   That you can use graphic design like camouflage -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Before we are going much further, you're now saying that any -- you're saying there is no copyright on those things. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Oh, no.   We are saying -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " On those pictorial representations -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- because they can always be applied in a way that has a function. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " That -- that's not correct, because if you took the sports logo that the government mentioned, that's a perfect example of something that doesn't require the garment for its functionality, because, just like we were discussing earlier, you could take the logo, and you could put it on your hat or your socks or your lunch pail or on your -- your mitten that you hold up when the folks hit the home run, right, because it doesn't rely at all for the article on which it's appeared for its functionality. But here, these designs rely entirely -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Certain kinds make you look fatter -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Right.   Exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You believe that -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " And if -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you're saying none -- even if you find a color rainbow of some weird ilk that could never be copyrighted, because -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " They -- they could have the copyright in the two-dimensional design, but if there was an application where it would create functionality when paired with a garment, then, yes, their copyright would not extend to prevent -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How about the gorilla, a gorilla's hand around your -- one of the pictures in -- "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Right.   That -- that's a much closer case than this one. For starters, if we're walking through the analysis, first you look at the identified separately, and, here, when you look at the arrangements of the stripes and the color blocks and the chevrons, you -- you see the cheerleader uniforms. And this is Justice Breyer's point about page 17 of the Lemley brief, right, that the aesthetic elements exist only as part of a cheerleader uniform. There's nothing to extract.   That's why this case is different than the gorilla case. So then what you have to ask is if the -- the -- the T-shirt in that case was less functional without the design, and I think that's a -- a close call. But -- but this case is like the camouflage because it's -- it's doing the work of changing the way the body is perceived just the way camouflage changes the way the body is perceived, and just like military uniforms, having an identifying function which is extremely important. So I -- I bring this all back to what the Chief Justice said, isn't it the test, if it's the design that makes the article what it is, then you can't copyright it.   And I would say that that's almost exactly right. They can copyright the design and prevent reproduction of the two-dimensional design on the notebook or the lunchbox, but if it's the design that makes the article what it is, you can't manufacture -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " How do we decide that it's -- how do we decide that it's the design that makes it what it is, as opposed to the cut of the garment, the shape, the pleats or whatever, the tightness of the top? What -- why should we say that -- that this two-dimensional design, which could be put on many things, is what makes this article utilitarian? But what do you do about the shape? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Well, here it's more than just the shape.   If we go back and look at page -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But we -- everybody agrees that the shape, the cut of the dress, that the garment itself is not copyrightable, right? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Correct.   Everyone agrees. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So we are talking about the -- the design. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So why -- why is this close to a fabric design? "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Because, again, the fabric designs work anywhere, anyplace, no matter how you move them.   If we are looking at page 5 and you've got the waist narrowing Vs, which are not the shape of the dress but they -- they make the illusion that the shape of the dress is cutting in to make you slimmer, those only work in that particular place on this article. If you put those on the lunchbox, they don't make the person look narrower.   They don't even make the lunchbox look narrower. The designs, the shape of the designs work just like the shape of the garment itself, and -- and that's why this is different than that flowered print that we were talking about in the -- the Folio case. You know, in -- in conclusion, I want to go back to what Justice Breyer and what Justice Sotomayor said: That if you recognize their -- their two-dimensional copyright extends to prohibit the manufacture of actual three-dimensional cheerleader uniforms, then -- then you're giving them 100-year of copyright monopoly, and that school can't go anywhere else.   And that's really ironic because you have to keep in mind that -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, can't the school just go to somebody who puts the zigzag where the chevron was, or the chevron where the zigzag was, or makes it a couple of different colors or adds another stripe? I mean, there's this -- my clerk found -- I'm sorry.   Just add that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, you can -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I'm done with my question. "}, {"speaker": "John J. Bursch", "text": " Yeah, as my -- as my friend on the other side said, it -- it would still be a copyright problem because they would claim that it was too close to the original. And you can see from the last two pictures that we have in our reply brief, that there are only certain places that these stripes and chevrons and color blocks can go, otherwise it doesn't look like a cheerleader uniform anymore.   It doesn't identify the person.   Certainly doesn't have the slimming effect, the making taller effect, and all the other things that camouflage do. So we respectfully request that you not grant a 100-year copyright monopoly in design. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted. "}]
