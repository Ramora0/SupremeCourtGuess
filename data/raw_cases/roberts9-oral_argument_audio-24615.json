[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-71, Weyerhaeuser Company versus the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Mr. Bishop. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress amended the Endangered Species Act in 1978 to narrow the concept of critical habitat, and it did that in response to this Court's decision in Hill and an early regulation that allowed critical habitat designation for population expansion beyond a species' present habitat.   In the provision that requires designation of critical habitat, Section 4, Congress limited the Service's power to designate to any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat. In Section 3(5)(C), Congress commanded that critical habitat shall not include the entire area which can be occupied by a species. And those limitations show that Congress intended that areas that can be occupied by a species -- that is, its habitat -- mark the outer bounds, the outer bounds of critical habitat, and it would be perverse -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Bishop, may -- may I offer you a hypothetical just to understand the scope of your argument, which is a bit unclear to me? So, in my hypothetical, there is a species which, like this one, is in only a single habitat, and for whatever reason, that habitat is no longer going to support the species. Disease has come, a predator has come, it's gotten too hot, it's gotten too cold, whatever it is.   That single habitat no longer will be able to support the species.   And there is no habitat that at the present moment -- there is no other habitat that at the present moment is capable of conserving the species over the long term. But there is a habitat that, with only slight improvements, what the government calls reasonable efforts, can support the species. Okay? So habitat A where the species is, no longer any good.   Habitat B, it can't -- it won't conserve the species if left just as it is, but it only takes reasonable effort to conserve the species. Can the government designate that area as unoccupied, critical habitat? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No, it has to be habitat. Now, just to be plain, part of the problem with that is that the government -- when the government talks about reasonable changes, which is what -- is what it does here, what would be involved in -- on this piece of land for it to be inhabited -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I understand that you think -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S.

Bishop", "text": " Right.   I don't rule out that the government might be able to justify a critical habitat designation when there are de minimis changes, where you're really only talking about digging a few holes, where there is a very minimal change required in the land. That isn't this case.   We haven't seen the government's justification for doing that. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I want to -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " What happens when you have a reasonable -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- I want to stick to my hypothetical, which is, you know, maybe something more than de minimis but -- but -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S.

"}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No, we don't think so, Justice Kagan. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And why is that? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " And the reason is -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Where in the statute do you find that? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " The statute says it in three places.   It says in Section 4 that only habitat of such species can be designated as critical habitat. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But we know that habitat -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " It says it in Section 3(5)(C) -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- doesn't mean -- excuse me, I'm sorry. We know that habitat doesn't mean just where a species lives.   I mean, that's -- that would be the common understanding of the word \"habitat,\" but this statute clearly goes beyond that, and we know because it says -- it's also where a statute -- where a species could live, right? It's out -- there are also habitats that are outside the geographical area occupied by the species. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " But those are -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So we know that the statute is not using the kind of garden-variety definition of habitat. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No, I -- I disagree with that, Justice Kagan.   3(5)(C) says the critical habitat cannot be designated beyond the entire area which can be occupied.   Congress was thinking about habitat in the sense that it is used in -- in common speech and in the dictionaries, which is a \"can be occupied\" sense.   Let me give you an example: The 1979 Convention of -- on Migratory Species, to which we are a signatory, says it's an area which contains suitable living conditions. The Forest Service, contemporaneously with these amendments in 1978, said that it's the environment where all the essentials for a species' development and existence are present. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But if you use the migratory bird example, then we have here the ephemeral ponds, which are supposed -- supposed to be ideal for breeding, so it's -- it's a habitat that is suitable for breeding. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " I disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg.   It's -- it's -- it's incorrect to label that as habitat because the frog spends only less than a month in breeding ponds.   For this to be a habitat, it has to be land which can be occupied. The habitat here includes -- and this is list -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But is it -- is it -- is it true with -- in -- in the case of birds that they may stay at a place less than a month? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " That's an entirely different example, Justice Ginsburg.   The habitat for a migratory bird includes a summer habitat, a winter habitat, and the places along the way where it has to -- where it roosts.   It may -- it may prefer particular trees.   You have a contiguous habitat, and the roosting trees clearly can be listed as critical habitat if they meet the other conditions. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If I could go back to the -- the statutory basis for your position, because, to my mind, it is a counterintuitive result that the statute would prefer extinction of the species to the designation of an area which requires only certain reasonable improvements in order to support the species. That seems a counterintuitive result, and, as I say, it does not seem a result that's demanded at all by the statutory language, which contemplates that habitats will exist even beyond the areas where a species currently resides. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Justice Kagan, there is a difference between an area -- an unoccupied area that is habitat and an unoccupied area that is not habitat. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Bishop -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " The statute reaches -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- do you agree -- I'm sorry.   Continue. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " The statute reaches only in 3(5)(C) critical habitat shall not include the entire area which can be occupied.   That is the limit that Congress set.   It must be habitat that can be -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I think that that was dealing with a very different problem. That was dealing with a problem where a species can reside in many areas outside of the area where it resided, and the statute was making clear that just because that's true, you can't go designate all of those areas habitat. But this is a different problem from the problem that we're talking about where there's only a single area that might conceivably prevent extinction of the species. And you're saying that, notwithstanding that it was -- it's only reasonable efforts that would allow it to conserve the species, that's not permitted. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " It is not.   And there are clear statutory indications that -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, do you -- Mr. Bishop, do you agree with the proposition that the choice in Justice Kagan's hypothetical is between designation of the land as critical habitat and extinction of the species? Are there not -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- other options available to the federal government? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " There are other options and there are other clues in the statutory language.   Apart from section 4 and 3(5)(C), what this Court said in Sweet Home was that the Section (5) purchase authority was well suited for buying land that is not yet but may in the future become habitat.   That was this Court's decision in Sweet Home. In addition, I would point out the definition of conservation in Section 3.3, which you would think if Congress had in mind that restoration and creation of new habitat, which is what would be required on this land, let there be no doubt, if that was what it had in mind, it would have used one of those terms for the list in 3-3 talks about maintenance of habitat and translocation.   It does not talk about the creation of new habitat or the restoration of habitat back to the period before human intervention. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- but I guess what strikes me about the statute, Mr. Bishop, is that really all over the place you get these references to the fact that habitat isn't just sort of there and perfect always, that habitat requires things to be done to it. You know, even in the definition of \"occupied critical habitat,\" it talks about special management that needs to be taken in order to protect the habitat. And, similarly, in the definition of \"conservation,\" it talks about, you know, the need for habitat improvement. So -- so all through the statute there's this idea of it's not just an on/off switch, that there is habitat that needs to be maintained, improved, and so forth in order to fulfill the function of preserving a species. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " With all due respect, Justice Kagan, I don't think that's right.   I think that all of those references to habitat are references to maintaining habitat that already exists.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " May I ask you a preliminary question? And it concerns whether the landowner's claim is currently ripe.   That is, you are not commanded to do anything.   You don't have to do anything at all to -- to conserve the endangered species.   And you can continue the -- what is it, timber farming that's going on. Now it may be that down the road you will want to do something else with the land, but wouldn't that be the appropriate time to seek exclusion? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No, Justice Ginsburg. The -- the immediate effect of this overlay of a critical habitat on this 1500 acres is a diminution in value of tens of millions of dollars.   That is what it says in the agency's economic analysis, that there is an immediate loss in value. And the reason I think for that is fairly easy to -- easy to see.   Any buyer coming in will recognize that down the road they have to deal with -- with the critical habitat designation. We have ourselves spent hundreds of thousands of dollars completely planning out and obtaining a rezoning of this land for development.   We -- those are wasted expenditures at this point.   That was done before the critical habitat designation. We would have to go back, we would have to revisit those, obtain changes in the zoning and change our plans.   But the critical point here is that the agency itself found that there was an immediate loss of value to our land. This is our land that has been designated.   We are the object, to use Lujan's -- Lujan's terms, we are the object of this designation.   And it has caused us immediate financial losses, both sunk costs that we already have and changes in order to be able to -- to proceed. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " This is a royal we.   As I understand it, the only appellant before us is yours, who's the lessee of the timberland, who owns a de minimis amount of acres. So it wasn't the lessee of the timber cutting.   It was the separate owner of the land who's incurred these expenses, and that's not an appellant before us, is it? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No, we incurred all of these expenses as the -- as the economic analysis explains. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But who are you representing? I thought the -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " The agreement between Weyerhaeuser -- the agreement between Weyerhaeuser and the owners of the rest of the property is that we would expend the money and they will provide the land. We also own 150 acres.   We provided all of the money for the development and we own 150 acres that have been designated that have immediately lost value as a result of this. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can I go back to a question? As I was reading the evidence in this case, it appeared that there was a dispute as to whether this frog could, in fact, survive, maybe not as healthily as it does now, and maybe not for the very long term, but there was evidence that the frog was there for, I think, 10 or 15 years while timber cutting was occurring. There was some scientific evidence that there were stumps that the frog might be able to survive in, as opposed to the canopied forest.   I -- I -- I know that the Fifth Circuit said that there was no dispute this wasn't currently habitable, but I think that depended on what definition you gave to habitable. If we give a different definition, what would be the minimum, if it didn't include the PCEs that you think are necessary? Because I don't know that unoccupied has to be an optimal survival place, and if it doesn't have to be optimal, what would otherwise be a minimum? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " This property is not just not optimal.   It is not habitable.   And this is only the litigating position of the Department of Justice. The judges below who looked at -- the Fifth Circuit judges, including the majority, not just the dissenters, who looked at the administrative record here, which is what this Court is reviewing, not the litigating position of the Department of Justice, concluded -- and this is from the majority -- that the Service had found that this was -- Unit 1 was currently uninhabitable.

In the -- in the Joint Appendix on page 57, there is a photo, albeit a small one, of adult frogs' uplands habitat. And it's a picture of a few trees with a grassland savanna.   And the scientific experts that you refer to, Justice Sotomayor, for example, Lannoo, talk about the habitat that's needed on the uplands as a savanna. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I think it's begging -- it's begging the question, which is I don't know that the circuit below actually accepted your definition or whether your definition, for the reasons I indicated just a few minutes ago, covered all of the conditions that could make for survival for the species.

Breyer", "text": " I'd like to ask you, I've not -- one way of looking at the case, as I started looking at it, is this isn't about words, really, or definitions.   Every time the word \"habitat\" is used, or almost every time, they talk about critical habitat, which is a defined term.   But the key words that follow it are \"typically essential\" or \"necessary,\" so something like that. So, in thinking about it, I thought, well, air is necessary.   We're going to be in real trouble without it.   But it's not the only thing that's necessary.   Water is necessary too. So you could have for mammals situations where they need air and they can't be submerged in a swamp.   So this land will have the air, but it's a big swamp.   But maybe we'll drain it.   So, if we drain it, it's going to be fine. And if that's what the statute basically means -- you get the idea where I'm driving -- then this is a typical agency case, because, after all, if you can't drain the swamp, then the air is irrelevant. But if you could drain the swamp pretty easily, well, then the air is essential and you better be sure you have it. Now, on that, the agency has found, well, it's not that hard to drain the swamp. Good chance we'll do it.   Good chance we'll do it.   You say: Ha, they don't know what they're -- well, I mean, you're polite about it. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And -- and so you don't -- isn't what we have to do, we look at the record, it's -- the discretion is given to the Secretary.   That's a lot.

Period.   Typical agency case. Now is that how I should look at it? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No, not at all.   The administrative record here shows that this land would have to be totally remade.   It would have to be made to look something like that picture on JA 70 -- 77. And that burden is not something that is allowed by language, plain language, in the statute that requires that the habitat -- the habitat -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, we're looking at it the same way.   You just want me to come out differently. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " I would like to spend a couple minutes, if I may, on judicial review. The court below held that the exclusion decision here is not subject to judicial review.   And the government argues that that was correct. The statutory language of the exclusion decision here, Section 4(b)(2), is that the agency may exclude any area from designation if the Secretary determines that the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of inclusion. So it's not a \"may\" statement from Congress.   It's a \"may/if.\" May exclude if these other conditions are met.   It weighs the benefits of exclusion against the benefits of inclusion. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, it is a \"may/if.\" But if the other conditions are met, it indicates, because of the use of the \"may,\" rather than the use of a \"shall,\" doesn't it, that the Secretary still has discretion? In other words, if the conditions aren't met, then the Secretary can't exclude. But if the conditions are met, the Secretary may exclude if he wants. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Yes, ultimately, there's -- it's a discretionary decision.   I think the question is whether State Farm review of that \"if\" clause is appropriate.   And this Court has already decided that question in Bennett, a unanimous decision of this Court where it considered both parts of that (b)(2) provision. And the Court said it is rudimentary that discretion as to the substance of the ultimate decision does not confer discretion to ignore the required procedures of decision-making.

Maybe you can help me out with this.   Let's suppose for now that I would agree with you and that we could review this. What more would you expect the Secretary to say, or could say, given the state of scientific evidence before the Secretary? That's not clear to me.   The Secretary says there's -- there's just not any evidence of the benefits of exclusion that I -- that I can put a number on. And isn't -- isn't the way the statute written put some burden of proof incumbent upon the landowner or lessee to come forward with something quantifying the benefits of exclusion? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Right.   Well, certainly, it's permissible for the agency to rely -- to characterize the benefits of inclusion as being biological, which is something that can be described but not quantified. But, on the other side of that ledger, the agency has to meet State Farm standards in identifying what the factors -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And what -- what -- on that, my question is, what more would you ask the Secretary to do? The Secretary did quantify the economic benefits exclusion and then said, compared to the benefits of inclusion, they're indeterminate.   And, therefore, the burden of proving exclusion has not been met. And that burden, it seems to me, rests with you.   So suppose I -- there's some judicial review possible here.   Do we need to get into how many angels dance on the head of that pin if you -- if you've got no real complaint at the end of the day with the adequacy of the Secretary's -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Well, we do -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- reasoning? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " -- we do have that complaint.   And, certainly, a remand would -- would allow us to explore that.   But here, under State Farm, the inputs -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, could you explain that to me? "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Yes, the inputs into the decision have to be fair and reasonable and the connection between those inputs and the ultimate decision have to be. Let -- let me give an example of a very basic error that -- an example of an internal inconsistency. So the -- the Service refused to factor in the loss of Unit 1 to housing and to St. Tammany's tax base, and it did that because it found that Unit 1 is only 0.5 percent of developable land in the parish. There's a big problem with that.   It included as developable land everything under -- south of Interstate 12, which is not developable because it flooded in Hurricane Katrina, everyone from that area is moving up to -- to us, to the higher ground. It said, in addition, it acknowledged that Unit 1 is particularly attractive for development because Highway 36 runs through it. It's an attractive area for development because it's connected to centers of -- where jobs -- where the jobs are. And yet -- so we have a Unit 1 that is already zoned, it's outside the flood zone, and it's well served by roads connecting it to jobs, but the Service treated every undeveloped area in the parish as fungible and said this just isn't an important development area, even though St. Tammany, as its brief explains in this case, says no, it's a very important development area. The -- that is what you get when there's no judicial review, when an agency thinks that there are no controls over what it concludes. And the economic analysis is riven through with very basic errors of that kind. And I would submit that without the possibility of judicial review in cases like this, that is what you get, a very unsatisfactory balancing. And that is what State Farm is for. State Farm is there to ensure that when a balancing like this has to be done, when there are multiple factors to be considered, that the agency gets it fairly right as to what those factors are and then connects up the dots between what those factors are and what its ultimate conclusion is.   Not the one-line conclusion -- unexplained conclusion that it had here that it was not going to exclude. If I can save the rest of my time for rebuttal, please. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

So having the expertise of the Fish and Wildlife Service identify those areas that are necessary for recovery of the species, can, for example, identify the areas that would be -- that a conservation group might want to enter into an agreement with the landowner to conserve, that -- that the -- that the state might decide to purchase, so the identification of the habitat is not just in terms of triggering Section 7 of the -- of the Act.

The question is, who is going to have to pay and who should pay for the preservation of this public good? Now it may be very difficult for a lot of people to shed tears for a big corporation like the one in this case, but let's suppose this is a -- this is a family farm and part of the -- the land is designated or a good part of it is designated as critical habitat.

It's not reasonable to say that this area is essential if the frogs will die anyway because there aren't enough trees.   Okay? So let's look at the picture on page 57.

The first one is \"the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.\" The reference to modification of habitat suggests that even with modification, it's still habitat, even though it's been modified. And one of the reasons that land is unoccupied by a species is often precisely because of what has happened, people using the land in a way or transforming the land.   But this -- this passage contrasts destruction of the habitat, which would be the case if -- if there was a parking lot or a building or some -- something that transformed it, and modification of the habitat, which suggests that it retains its essential nature.

Kneedler", "text": " Yes.   If there's federal land involved, other federal agencies could do it, but the Secretary would have no independent authority with respect to private land, except the designation of critical habitat. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bishop, you have four minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Justice Gorsuch, to your point, 7(a)(1) imposes an obligation on all other federal agencies which shall, in consultation with the Secretary, utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. Critical habitat is just one part. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But that's only if it's designated critical habitat. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No, no, no, that is a general obligation.   I can tell you that whenever you go for a Clean Water Act permit, you don't -- it doesn't have to be -- no critical habitat need be involved.   State wildlife agencies and FWS immediately gets involved and has to sign off on those. Critical habitat does not have to be involved.   And there's a perfect example in this case.   If you read the final designation here, the properties in Mississippi were restored before there was any critical habitat designation. And CBD in its brief says that in doing so, the frog survived in Mississippi through \"intense human effort and extensive habitat restoration.\" That was all done before the critical habitat designation in this case.   So the -- so -- and -- and just to understand here, and to respond to this changes in sync argument that Mr. Kneedler made, there is nothing in sync about creating a -- an open savanna on our property. This is an intensive 1500-acre tree farm.   The trees are planted 10 to 12 feet apart.   There is no groundcover because the sunlight does not reach the forest floor, and we don't want it to because that interferes with tending to the trees.   It interferes with harvesting them. This is not a property on which there will be any groundcover to supply moisture or food or cover for these frogs.   We would have to totally change the way that this land operates in order to accommodate the frog. And the idea that the frog scientists here agree with the government is simply wrong. And I would urge the Court to read Lannoo and Pechmann and Blihovde, who say, for example, Pechmann, one of the scientists, the upland is currently in commercial pine plantations but -- but could be restored to suitable upland habitat. Blihovde says that aggressive and proactive management of the uplands will be critical to the survival of the frog, the most important management tool being fire to prevent this from being unsuitable habitat. These scientists all have the same point of view, that this land could be restored through extensive effort to upland frog habitat.   Not one of them said that this is currently habitat on what this frog -- on which this frog can -- can't survive. The immediacy here, Justice Kagan, comes from the statutory language.   It comes from the word \"habitat\" in Section 4.   It comes from the limitation in 3(5)(C) that the maximum extent of a critical habitat designation is land that can be occupied.   It comes from the list in 3(3) where you would certainly have anticipated that if Congress thought that land had to be restored or totally remade in order to be habitat for the frog, that it would have said that rather than using the word \"maintenance.\" Maintenance is a word that naturally refers to maintaining what you already have there and improving it, not to completely changing it. And, in addition -- in addition to the powers that I already talked about of the federal agencies having to protect these creatures quite apart from critical habitat designation, there are all sorts of powers operated through the states and the purchase power in Section 5 that allow protection. This is not a choice between the frog surviving and -- and not surviving if it doesn't have this critical habitat.   There are plenty of ways for the government to ensure, as it should, that the frog survives. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   I think I read that if these ponds are not designated, that there are no other ponds in the United States. So, to the extent that these ponds are not designated critical habitat, and don't survive, this frog won't, if there's a drought or other conditions in Mississippi. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Well, first of all, there are other ways to acquire these ponds.   Not one person has talked, from the government, or from any of the nature conservancy or other groups that buy easements on property have talked to any of the owners here. But the -- the second thing is that -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But they don't have to. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " No, they don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If it's critical -- "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Well, they -- well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- they can designate it and then a deliberate process goes on where they talk to the owners, and you come to an accommodation.   That's what generally happens. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " Could I answer that question, Chief Justice? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Briefly. "}, {"speaker": "Timothy S. Bishop", "text": " I mean, you know, the government has made absolutely clear what it thinks that means, right? It -- it -- it admits that it's the most likely outcome here, if we need to apply for permits, is that we get to use 40 percent of the land for development and we have to turn 60 percent of it over for frog habitat. We don't think that that is an appropriate use of our land, given that this is not habitat to begin with. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
