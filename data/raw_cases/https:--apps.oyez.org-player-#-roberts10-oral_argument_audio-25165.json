[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-587, the Department of Homeland Security versus Regents of the University of California, and the related cases. General Francisco. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2017, the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA and the expansion of DACA were likely unlawful, a judgment this Court affirmed by an equally divided Court.   In the face of those decisions, the Department of Homeland Security reasonably determined that it no longer wished to retain the DACA policy based on its belief that the policy was illegal, its serious doubts about its illegality, and its general opposition to broad non-enforcement policies. That decision did not violate the APA for two reasons.   First, it's not subject to judicial review.   The rescission simply ended a previous non-enforcement policy whereby the Department agreed to not enforce the INA against hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens. But the decision whether or not to enforce the law is committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion, unless a statute restricts it.   And nothing in the INA requires the Department, a law enforcement agency, to not enforce the law. Second, the decision to end this non-enforcement policy was eminently reasonable. DACA was a temporary stopgap measure that, on its face, could be rescinded at any time.   And the Department's reasonable concerns about its legality and its general opposition to broad non-enforcement policies provided more than a reasonable basis for ending it. After all, an agency isn't required to push its legally dubious power to not enforce the law to its logical extreme since it undermines confidence in the rule of law itself and it conflicts with the agency's law enforcement mission. I'd like to begin with the reviewability question.   If the Attorney General were to say that he wasn't going to seek death penalty prosecutions because he thought the death penalty was unconstitutional, that would be immune from judicial review.   And if a new attorney general came in and reversed that policy because he believed that the death penalty was constitutional, that would likewise be immune from judicial review because -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " General Francisco, there's a strange element to your argument because you're arguing this is a discretionary matter; it's not reviewable because it's committed to agency discretion. But, on the other hand, you say the agency had no discretion because this program was illegal.   In other words, the law requires you to drop DACA.   So how can it be committed to your discretion when you're saying we have no discretion; this is an illegal program? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " For two reasons, Your Honor.   First, we've put forward both legal and policy reasons for the rescission, so this case is on all fours with Chaney, where the FDA likewise put forth legal and policy reasons. Its principal argument was that it lacked jurisdiction to reg -- to regulate state use of drugs in carrying out the death penalty.   Its alternative argument was that even if it had the legal authority to do so, it wouldn't have exercised it. And this Court found that that decision was committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion.   Here, we are likewise making alternative legal and policy arguments. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What's your -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " But, secondly -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Secondly, even if we were making purely a legal argument, and we're not, but even if we were, review would be foreclosed by this Court's decision in BLE. What the BLE case held was that if an action is committed to an agency's unreviewable discretion, then it doesn't matter what reason it gives for taking that action; it's still unreviewable.   And the specific example this Court provided in BLE was a prosecutor who decided not to indict for a purely legal reason. And the Court indicated that that was still unreviewable because the underlying action, the enforcement discretion, was committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion. So, here, we think we win under Chaney, and we also think we win under BLE. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What if the Attorney General said he, in his exercise of prosecutorial discretion, was not going to enforce any of the immigration laws? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Uh -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Would that still be non-reviewable? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Your Honor, then I think that you might run into Chaney's exception for a complete abdication of authority, but there's a critical difference between that and this.   Here, we are enforcing the law.   You can understand why Congress or the courts might say that you can review a -- a decision not to enforce the law.   Congress, in fact, passes laws so they'll be enforced, and you can understand why it might restrict the government's ability to not enforce the law. Here, we are enforcing the law.   And it's very difficult to see why the Congress would ever pass a law, say that something is illegal, and then try to hamstring the government's ability to enforce it.   That's why we think we clearly fall within the Chaney presumption, that it's an exercise of enforcement discretion, and we don't fall within the Chaney exception, which would apply where Congress itself restricts the discretion or where there's a potential complete abdication of enforcement authority, as Chaney made clear might also be an exception. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Was DACA -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Just to -- just to understand what you're saying, General, you -- that would suggest that the original DACA is reviewable, but the rescission of DACA is not. In other words, are you suggesting that there's an asymmetry in what's reviewable? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " There -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That they don't stand and fall together? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Yeah, there is, because there's a difference in the two policies.   Both of them -- to be clear, both of them fall within Chaney's presumption.   Both of them reflect an exercise of enforcement discretion that are presumptively unreviewable. The question then is whether Congress has done anything to restrict that discretion. With respect to DAPA, the case that this Court had before it a couple of years ago, Texas argued that the INA actually restricted the agency's ability not to enforce the law. And you can certainly understand why Congress might try to hamstring the government's ability not to enforce the laws that it passes.   And the Fifth Circuit agreed.   So that fell within the Chaney exception to the presumption. Here, though, nobody is arguing, nobody on either side, is arguing that the INA somehow restricts our ability to enforce the law.   And it would be quite surprising if Congress were to pass a law that says something is illegal and then tries to somehow restrict the government's ability from enforcing the laws that it passes. So, again, I think we fall four square within the Chaney presumption, and the Chaney exception doesn't apply.   And that exception applies -- that exception covers both where the statute itself restricts the discretion, and, Chief Justice, to your question, it could also apply where there was a complete abdication of law enforcement responsibilities.   That was one of the areas that Chaney reserved in that critical Footnote 4. But, here, we're not not enforcing the law.   We're enforcing the law.   And there is simply nothing in the INA that somehow says to the Department of Homeland Security you are restricted in any way or shape or form -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Can I go back -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " -- from enforcing the laws we pass. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " The response that you -- that you gave to me, I didn't see -- I thought that what you call it, the Duke Memorandum, Duke Memorandum said DACA is illegal.   I didn't see where it said, whether it's illegal or not, as a matter of administration policy, we are withdrawing. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Uh-huh.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I didn't see that. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You said there were alternate arguments.   I saw only the first, we can't enforce DACA; we can't adhere to DACA because it's illegal. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " So two responses, Your Honor.   First of all, Secretary Nielsen's memoranda clearly encompasses all of the different arguments.   It sets them forth in great detail.   And we think that the Nielsen memorandum is clearly properly before the Court. The district court in Washington, D.C., specifically asked for it.   We specifically provided it.   The district court reviewed it. So the only question really is, what does it mean? And Secretary Nielsen in her memorandum effectively ratified Secretary Duke's decision for the reasons given, using precisely the same mechanism that Secretary Duke used herself to issue the memo in the first place, the same mechanism that was issued -- used to issue the DACA memo, and the same mechanism used to issue the DAPA memo. So this isn't a post hoc rationalization of agency action.   It is agency action.   The whole point of the post hoc rationalization rule is to prevent courts from invading into executive branch decision-making. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I thought the point -- I mean, this is an old argument. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And there have been two bases.   The first base is a big argument between Ken Davis and Burger, you know, and is -- is it that you can't review an agency, does that little thing about you cannot -- commit it to agency discretion by law, does it mean that there's certain -- just mean that there are certain things an agency might do.   Don't review them even if they're totally wrong, like Panama Canal tolls. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay? That isn't here, I don't think. The Chaney argument, I thought was the reason this is unreviewable, is because there's a long history and tradition of a prosecutor saying, I know that guy over there, or that woman here, and they may be guilty, but, in my discretion, no, I don't want to prosecute them. There's a long history of that. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And if that history, an understandable power to give to a prosecutor, is to be valid, courts, stay out of it.   Now that does not apply where what's at issue is not a prosecutor making an individualized decision but, rather, an agency's policies -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- generalized, written down, and I can't think of a reason why in such a case you wouldn't review it in a court. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " So, respectfully, Honor, I strongly disagree because Chaney itself involved not a prosecutor but an agency and not a single shot enforcement action but a general policy. Here's what the FDA said in the letter denying the petition brought by the inmates to have it regulate the state exercise of the death penalty.   This is their principal conclusion. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " \"For the reasons given below, we conclude that the use of lethal injection by state penal systems is a practice over which FDA has no jurisdiction and, therefore, that FDA has no authority to take the actions your petition requests.   Accordingly, your petition is denied.\" It later provided as the alternative rationale a policy rationale, and it says later: \"Thus, as a secondary and separate basis of denial, we decline as a matter of enforcement discretion to pursue supplies of drugs under state control that will be used for execution by lethal injection.\" So, in Chaney, the FDA clearly was announcing a categorical policy that it wasn't going to regulate the state use of drugs in carrying out the death penalty.   And it wasn't a criminal prosecution.   So I think it's on all fours in favor of us. Here, we have an exercise of enforcement discretion that is committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion under Chaney. It doesn't fall with any -- within any of the exceptions to Chaney, where Congress either restricts the exercise of that discretion, because, here, we're talking about enforcement, not non-enforcement, and it doesn't fall under the complete abdication exception to Chaney because, again, we're talking about enforcement and not non-enforcement.   And Judge -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Wouldn't what -- wouldn't what you just read also have made DACA itself unreviewable, to pick up on Justice Kagan's question from earlier? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " No, Your Honor, and, again, because, critically, it falls within -- sure. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What -- what's the distinction between DACA and the FDA policy? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Oh, the DACA and the FDA policy? "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Well, because, in the FDA policy, nobody was claiming that somehow a statute restricted the FDA's ability to not enforce the law.   Nobody made that argument. In the DAPA litigation, I think is maybe what you're referencing, Texas specifically argued that the INA did, in fact, restrict the agency's authority to exercise its enforcement discretion to not enforce the law. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, one of the -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " And, again -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- things that -- one of the things that Texas argued in the DAPA case was that the agency action in question there conferred certain benefits on the individuals who were affected. And if that was sufficient to make that reviewable, does the wind-down of DACA remove certain benefits that individuals would have? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And, if it does, would that make this reviewable? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " I -- I -- I think the answer is no and no.   And the reason why is, first of all, the rescission of DACA doesn't rescind any benefits.   Those benefits are allowed to expire on their own terms. But, even putting that to the side, the work authorization and the other benefits are simply a collateral consequence of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion itself. So they don't recognize -- they don't make the prosecutorial discretion itself reviewable; otherwise, every grant or denial of deferred action would be subject to APA review because every grant and denial of deferred action has collateral consequences that impact work authorization. If I could give you a hypothetical that I think makes it more concrete: Suppose a prosecutor has a drug diversion program, and he says that I'm not going to prosecute this particular category of drug offenses if the individuals agree to enter into drug treatment. The drug treatment is a collateral consequence of and a benefit that flows from the prosecutorial decision, but it doesn't render the prosecutorial decision itself subject to review.   And, likewise, if a new prosecutor comes in and says, I don't like drug diversion programs, I want to have a zero tolerance policy for drug offenses, that isn't reviewable either. But I do think that the challenge to DAPA in the prior litigation was reviewable -- to be clear, it was reviewable because it fell within the Chaney exception.   Texas argued, the Fifth Circuit agreed, that the INA, in fact, restricted the Department of Homeland Security's ability to not enforce the law.   And, frankly, we -- we -- we agree with that. But the problem here is that there's no argument by anybody or any possible argument that could be made that somehow the INA restricts the Department of Homeland Security's authority to enforce the law.   After all, Congress typically wants the executive branch to enforce the laws -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " General -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " -- that it passes. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- are you -- is this an appropriate moment to move to, assuming reviewability, the merits? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Any time you want to move there, Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " -- I'll move there. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " One -- one -- one argument that the other side makes along those lines is similar to this one we've just been considering, the reliance interests that have grown up around DACA. And what do -- what do you say to that and whether they've been adequately considered in this case? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Sure.   Two things, Your Honor.   First, I would say that to the extent there are any reliance interests, they're extremely limited.   DACA was always meant to be a temporary stopgap measure that could be rescinded at any time, which is why it was only granted in two-year increments.   So I don't think anybody could have reasonably assumed that DACA was going to remain in effect in perpetuity. Even putting that to the side here, the agency considered the reliance interests. Secretary Nielsen did so quite clearly and explicitly. The agency mitigated the reliance interests through the orderly wind-down, and it simply concluded that beyond that it didn't justify maintaining in perpetuity a program that actively facilitated violations of the law by hundreds of thousands of individuals. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " May I ask -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " If I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No, no, continue. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Thank you.   If I understand, though, your colleague's argument on the other side, it's not that Secretary Nielsen failed to consider reliance interests.   There's that paragraph, I believe, in the petition appendix around 125, somewhere in there. There's a -- there's a paragraph. But that -- but that given the extent of the reliance interests and the size of the class, more needed to be said, more could be said, and it wouldn't be a huge burden to require the government on remand to -- to say more. What -- what -- what -- what do you say to that? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " So as I understand that, that's the nature of the argument. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right.   And I guess I'd have a couple of responses to that. The first is that I -- I don't think it reflects an accurate understanding of APA review.   As this Court has repeatedly made clear, really, the only thing that matters is whether the agency -- and I think I'm quoting from the case law -- completely failed to consider an important aspect of the question. And I don't think that you can even remotely argue here, under State Farm, that we completely failed to consider an important aspect of the question. Secondly, I think that Secretary Duke's memorandum under the proper standard clearly satisfies the APA standard for -- for considering reliance interests.   She does so explicitly in -- in the portion of the memorandum that you referenced. And, in addition, what I'd point out is that at the very beginning of her memorandum, page 2, she specifically says that one of the things that she considered were the judicial opinions reviewing the Duke Memorandum, all of the district court decisions. And so then, when she gets to the specific discussion of reliance interests, she says that she is keenly aware that people have ordered their lives in light of the DACA decision.   So I think it's quite clear that she is fully taking into account the whole panoply of reliance interests that were discussed ad nauseam in the district court decisions and simply concluding that they didn't just -- justify maintaining the policy. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If I could continue the same question because, look I -- the best statement of the law in my mind -- this is a very old principle -- again, was Justice Scalia's writing for the Court in Fox. He says, when an agency's \"prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests, it must be taken into account.\" All right.   That's this case, I think. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   So I counted -- I had my law clerks count, actually, not just the people who came in, you know, the 700,000 -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- they've never been anywhere else.   They -- they never have to.   But there are all kinds of reliance interests. I counted briefs in this Court, as I'm sure you have, which state different kinds of reliance interests.   There are 66 healthcare organizations.   There are three labor unions. There are 210 educational associations.   There are six military organizations.   There are three home builders, five states plus those involved, 108, I think, municipalities and cities, 129 religious organizations, and 145 businesses. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And they all list reliance interests, or most of them list interest reliance -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- interests applicable to them, which are not quite the same, they are not quite the same as those of the 700,000 who have never seen any other country.   And so then I did read what you just read to me. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now you want to say anything about the statement you just read to me being adequate to take into account that broad range of interests? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, I do, because the first thing I want to say is that State Farm itself says, and, here, I've got the quote, you violate the APA only where you \"entirely fail to consider an important aspect of the problem.\" Here, Secretary Nielsen explicitly considered the reliance interests, including all of the things that you just listed that were set forth in -- in excruciating detail in the numerous district court decisions that have ruled -- had ruled against us -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- but not -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J.

But the other thing that I would say is that under this conception of APA review, DACA and DAPA likewise would have failed arbitrary and capricious review because there is not a single word in the DACA memo itself or the DAPA memo itself explaining any of the potential costs or benefits or impacts on other people that the implementation of the -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If -- if I understand Secretary Nielsen's memo correctly, Secretary Nielsen said that she -- she did have a -- a conclusory statement about weighing the reliance interests, but she weighs them against what she calls -- I think it's the questionable legality of the program. Now that assumes one of the things that we're all here to discuss, which is that the program was of questionable legality.   If the program turns out not to be of questionable legality, in other words, if some or many of us think that the original program was legal, how does her memo suffice to do that balancing? "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Sure.   For a couple of reasons, Your Honor.   First, because she sets forth separate and independent bases justifying the rescission: first, her belief that it's illegal; second, her belief that there are serious doubts about its illegality; and, third, her conclusion that, as a matter of enforcement policy, the Department of Homeland Security is against these kinds of broad-based non-enforcement decisions. Any one of those, as her memo explicitly says -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But in her -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " -- is a separate and independent basis. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- in her statement about reliance, she particularly says it outweighs this questionably legal program. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " I think what she is saying here is that it outweighs -- is that, given that there are extremely limited reliance interests in the first place, any limited reliance interests that exist are outweighed -- are -- are outweighed by all of the different reasons that she has articulated as separate and independent grounds for rescinding DACA. I think that's the only fair way -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " General -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " -- that you can read that memorandum. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- I'm -- I have always had some difficulty in understanding the illegality of DACA.   DAPA I put aside because, in DAPA -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J.

And so I've always had some difficulty in understanding what's wrong with an agency saying, we're going to prioritize our removals, and for those people, like the DACA people -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- who haven't committed crimes, who are lawfully employed, who are paying taxes, who pose no threat to our security, and there's a whole list of prerequisites, we're not going to exercise our limited resources -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J.

And so he hasn't and, instead, he's done this.   And that, I think, has something to be considered before you rescind the policy. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " Right.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " And maybe we'd have an opportunity to hear the three answers. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But, don't forget the three.   I know you won't.

Francisco", "text": " Yeah.   So, Your Honor, four responses now.   I think I've added one. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " The first one is that I -- I think that the prior President didn't, couldn't, and hasn't made any kind of promise that DACA would remain in effect in perpetuity because it would have been impossible to make that promise.   In fact, every one of my friends on the other side, I think, has agreed that we could rescind DACA at any time if, at least in their view, we did provide a little bit more detailed of an explanation. So I think that is four square against the notion that there are some significant reliance interests because all that they seem to be saying is we have to write a few more words. Putting that entirely to the side and turning to the legality question, ultimately, I don't think you -- my first point is I don't think you have to decide ultimately whether DACA is legal or illegal because I think the other reasons we've given are more than sufficient to justify the rescission, both our serious doubts about its legality, as well as our general opposition to broad-based non-enforcement policies. After all, the Department of Homeland Security is a law enforcement agency, and a law enforcement agency doesn't have to push its dubious power to not enforce the law to its logical extreme.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But don't you have to -- don't you have to set up some kind of categories? I mean, everybody agrees, what is that, how many, 11 million people?

Francisco", "text": " Well, and that's my second point, Your Honor.   My second point is that DACA goes far beyond simply diverting resources to higher priority targets, which you are absolutely right, every law enforcement agency has to divert resources to higher priority targets.   DACA goes materially further than that because it actively facilitates violations of the law by providing advance forbearance, coupling it with affirmative benefits like work authorization and Social Security benefits, doing it on a categorical basis. And, significantly -- and this was my third point -- it has no limiting principle.   On the -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So the -- the forbearance would be okay if it -- there weren't attendant benefits?

Francisco", "text": " I think that would be -- if -- if you provided just the advanced forbearance, I think that would be a lot closer of a question, but, here, it's a lot easier because you're coupling that with work authorization. And my final and critical point is that there's no limiting principle.   The theory on which DACA rests effectively allows the government to create a shadow INA for any category of aliens that it chooses to make low-priority targets, a shadow second-tier INA. And you, at the very least, need to locate something in the INA that confers that kind of broad and unfettered discretion.   And there is simply nothing there.

First, I'm saying you don't really have to address this issue because we think all of the other -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I got that. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J. Francisco", "text": " -- reasons are more than sufficient. But, secondly, we're not saying that there's a specific provision that it conflicts with.

May I make one more sentence?

"}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson. "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government's termination of DACA triggered abrupt, tangible, adverse consequences and substantial disruptions in the lives of 700,000 individuals, their families, employers, communities, and Armed Forces. That decision required the government to provide an accurate, reasoned, rational, and legally sound explanation. It utterly failed to do so, asserting only the Attorney General's unexplained assertion that he had no discretion because DACA was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch. The decision overturned a five-year enforcement policy of deferred action that had enabled DACA recipients under other unchallenged laws and regulations to apply for employment authorization, seek driver's licenses, and other benefits. Its abrupt reversal removed a condition precedent to these rights and exposed DACA recipients and their employers to immediate, potential, coercive government measures. It was impermissible to do so based on an unexplained, unsupported, and erroneous legal conclusion that the policy that two administrations had enforced and implemented, had supported and implemented for five years, was unlawful and unconstitutional. The decision to rescind DACA was reviewable.   This Court has said several times in the -- just in the past few years that there's -- we start with a strong presumption of reviewability of agency decisions.   This is the strong presumption that the Court described in the Weyerhaeuser case just one year ago. Unless agency discretion is limited by law, and there's no citation to any limitation in the law, limitations on administration -- reviewability by the courts are quite narrowly construed, and there are rare circumstances. These are the Mach Mining case and the Judulang case. These Weyerhaeuser, Mach Mining and Judulang case are three cases within the past eight years where this Court has talked about the presumption of reviewability as a strong presumption, narrowly -- exceptions narrowly construed, and all three of those decisions were unanimous decisions by this Court.

This is an agency decision initially, and -- and the Attorney General refers to it as an illegal decision, but it's an initial decision that is responsive to explicit congressional direction to DHS to establish enforcement priorities. That's what DACA was all about.   It said it did not establish any status, it did not provide any benefits, it articulated an enforcement priority which Congress not only directed DHS to make but, in fact, required it to make because only 400,000 people -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

The administration, when it does that kind of a decision with respect to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, which has engendered reliance, which reverses not only a position of the -- of two administrations, but the Office of Legal Counsel, changes policy, then all we're saying is that there's a presumption of reviewability of that decision.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But, Mr. Olson, the whole thing was about the work authorization and these other benefits.   Both administrations have said they're not going to deport the people.   So the deferred prosecution or deferred deportation, that's not what the focus of the policy was.   Yes, the other statutes provided that, but it was triggered by -- by the memo. "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So I don't understand sort of putting what the policy really was about, which is the work authorization and the other things, off to one side is very helpful. "}, {"speaker": "Theodore B. Olson", "text": " Well, I think that it -- you -- one has to focus on the fact that this was -- Congress authorized the IN -- the Department of Homeland Security to identify enforcement priorities.   Once it did -- because it -- it was required to do so and it had no choice because of the funding.   Once it did so, and it identified the persons -- and this is helpful to the agents in the field to identify which individuals are going to be subject to enforcement and which individuals are not. Other statutes provided that benefit. You're correct that it triggers that, but it's triggered by other benefits and so forth.   If the government is opposed to those benefits given to individuals who are not in an enforcement priority category to support themselves, to go to work, rather than put themselves in the hands of the government to support them, and to become a part -- since they're not going to be deported, at least for the short period of time, those are the things that if the government wanted to get rid of, the government should be challenging those. It should not be challenging a decision that's essentially required by Congress.   And let there be no mistake about why this decision was made. The Attorney General specifically said that DACA was illegal and unconstitutional.   I don't know where the unconstitutional came from because it didn't come from the Fifth Circuit. But let's say it was an un- -- an illegal enforcement priority. And there's no doubt about why this happened.   In the cert petition or in the government's brief that refers to the questions presented, it specifically says the original DACA policy was unlawful and then goes on to say, thus, it had to be terminated. There's no question about that.   So the Duke Memorandum, which was -- the Attorney General's decision and opinion under statute is enforceable and binding on the government agencies.   There's a statute that specifically says that.   So the Duke Memorandum had no discretion, no choice.

That's what your decisions require by judicial review. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mongan. "}, {"speaker": "Michael J. Mongan", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It was up to Petitioners to decide how to frame their decision to terminate DACA.   They could have taken responsibility for a discretionary decision, rescinding a policy that affects hundreds of thousands of lives. Instead, they chose to end the policy based on the ground that DACA was unlawful.   They told the public that the law deprived them of any discretion to continue it.   And when Judge Bates invited them to make a new decision, they stood by the old one. That's their prerogative, but it has the consequence that they have to defend that decision based on the legal rationale they originally offered, and the decision is reviewable and cannot be sustained on that basis. Now the problem with the rationale is, yes, they don't take serious account of the dramatic costs to DACA recipients and the economy and their employers and families of terminating this policy, and also that it is founded on the incorrect legal premise that DACA is unlawful. This Court can review the lack of -- and affirm based on the lack of an adequate explanation for that ground or the fact that it is an incorrect conclusion and it is legal error. Now, if I can turn to the question of reviewability, the APA says that it commits agency actions that are committed to agency discretion by law are unreviewable. And the central point here is that when a agency founds a decision on a public announcement that it lacks any discretion to continue a policy, that can't fairly be described as committed to agency discretion in any meaningful sense. This is the concept that the Court reserved in Footnote 4 of Chaney, because that is not a discretionary choice that the law has committed to agency discretion. I think that it is critical for us to consider on the merits what my friend's position is with respect to DACA and deferred action.   My friend appears to agree that they can grant deferred action to compelling individuals, that they can grant work authorization to deferred action recipients, and they seem to agree that this is a very worthy class of individuals. So their position boils down to the assertion that the INA prohibits them from adopting a transparent framework that guides the exercise of individualized discretion with respect to this very compelling population of individuals. And that's not consistent with the broad authority that Congress has granted the Secretary under the INA and under 6 U.S.C. 202, and it's not consistent with historical practice, where the agency, over the decades, has frequently adopted class-based discretionary relief policies that allow it to channel the exercise of recognized forms of discretion with respect to particular individuals in a defined class.

That's the number that availed themselves of that policy? "}, {"speaker": "Michael J. Mongan", "text": " That's right, because it was short-lived.   But, at the time it was announced, it was not clear that Congress was going to act, and the executive told Congress that this would apply to up to 40 percent of the undocumented population at the time. When Congress did act in that statute, they signaled their approval of the executive policy.   The statute didn't have an effective date for another year.   And Congress said that this is not intended to express disapproval of the existing executive policy. And that's one example, but there are more examples of -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That sounds -- that percentage was 1.5 million people, very comparable to this decision. "}, {"speaker": "Michael J. Mongan", "text": " Yes, and at a time when the total undocumented population was much smaller than it is today. Now it -- it is critical for the executive, in an area where it has broad discretionary authority, to be able to set policies that channel the exercise of that authority, and this is a transparent framework that has the benefit of allowing for some measure of consistency and an even-handed approach in the exercise of deferred action. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " General, suppose that this administration had not relied on legal grounds to rescind the policy, which is very different from what they did, but let's just suppose otherwise, that they had immediately and only relied on policy considerations.

And so what -- it can't mean that Heckler is interpreting this, committed to agency discretion, to make serious inroads in the principle of judicial review, but everybody's struggling, including me, what's the line? And what's the line generally? It can't be so broad of all programs. It can't be so narrow as an individualized decision.   Just what is it? "}, {"speaker": "Michael J. Mongan", "text": " Well, I think we can look to the language of the Chaney decision.   It describes a decision not to take enforcement action.

Breyer", "text": " So you're saying at the minimum, one, an action to enforce is different from an action not to enforce.   Here, we have one to enforce.

First, Justice Kavanaugh, I want to make sure you have all of the relevant portions in the Nielsen Memorandum that I think make this all quite clear.   Page 122a, and I'm at the Regents Petitioners' appendix.   \"In considering how DHS's discretion to establish enforcement policies and priorities should be exercised, the DACA policy properly was and should be rescinded for several separate and independently sufficient reasons.\" She then gives the first reason, the legality question. Then if you go to page 123a.   Second, \"regardless of whether the DACA policy is ultimately illegal, it was appropriately rescinded by DHS because there are at a minimum serious doubts about its legality.\" Further down the page, third, \"regardless of whether these concerns about the DACA policy render it illegal or legally questionable, there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy.\" And then she sets out the enforcement policy. If you move to page 121 -- 125a, where she's discussing reliance, \"I do not believe that the asserted reliance interests outweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the other reasons for ending the policy discussed above.\" And, finally, when you get to the conclusion on page 126a, \"for these reasons, in setting DHS enforcement policies and priorities, I concur with and decline to disturb Acting Secretary Duke's decisions to rescind the DACA policies.\" So, frankly -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But we don't know from -- "}, {"speaker": "Noel J.

Her whole memo is infected by the idea that this is, one, illegal.   It leaves substantial doubt about its illegality. If we take that out, then -- the independent ground that you're asserting, then she would be saying, we stand up and say this is the policy of our administration.   We don't like DACA and we're taking responsibility for that, instead of trying to put the blame on the law. "}, {"speaker": "Noel J.

Also, because we think this is not subject to judicial review at all, we own the legal judgment set forth in Secretary Nielsen's memoranda. So simply stated, the fact that we've got alternative and legal policy grounds for making this decision make two things clear. First, it is four square within Chaney under the reviewability issue because Chaney, likewise, was -- rested on alternative legal grounds.   The FDA believed it lacked jurisdiction and policy grounds.
