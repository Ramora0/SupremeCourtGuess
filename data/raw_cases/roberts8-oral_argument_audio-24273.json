[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-577, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer. Mr. Cortman. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State of Missouri has excluded The Learning Center from a recycling program that provides a safer playground for children solely because the preschool is operated by a church rather than a secular not-for-profit. The State has made several important concessions in this case.   Number one, that the policy in this case is not facially neutral, and number two, that based on their religious character, churches are not eligible for the benefit here. This admitted discrimination against religion violates this Court's Free Exercise Principles. First, as stated in McDaniel and Smith, the Free Exercise Clause prevents the government from imposing special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status, and forcing a choice between the exercise of religion and receiving either a government benefit, right, or privilege. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Assuming that there's no serious risk of an establishment violation, that's off the table, are there ever instances in which status -- religious status can be used to deny religions or religious believers benefits from the State? Or are you saying that it's -- that absent in Establishment Clause problem, that status can never be the base -- religious status can never be the basis for a governmental action or governmental ordinance, governmental statute? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I -- I'm not sure if it can be.   I can't think of a specific example.   And the reason I say that is, the question is, is why would someone's religious status matter in the first place to receiving a government benefit? And that's another -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " On that -- on that question, I guess rather long ago now in the Everson case back in 1947, this Court said in no uncertain terms what the Framers didn't want was tax money imposed to pay for building or maintaining churches or church property.   And doesn't that fit this case? And if so, is Everson pass\u00e9? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I don't think it does. Everson also said that we have to be careful in not establishing a church not to deprive religious people or organizations of general government benefits.   And so I think that's the key here.   I think there's a difference between funding of religious activities and funding secular activities of religious organization.   And I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how is the building separate from the religious exercise therein? I believe that this playground is part of the ministry of this church.   And, in fact, I look at its bylaws, I look at its advertisements, and it includes play and conducted in a religiously valuable way.   I think that's the materials that you're -- that the church is advertising. How do you separate out its secular function from its religious function? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I think the way the Court always has.   And the answer to that is, for example, even though the motivation behind operating this preschool is a religious motivation, doesn't mean that every single activity that occurs there happens to be religious. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, how about if the school does a prayer before the children start playing? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I don't think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Or how about if it chooses on a sunny day to do its religious instruction outside.   How does the State know or how can it control without then controlling on the -- on the basis of belief and viewpoint? How could they control against that involvement? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Sure.   It's the same way it has in all the case law.   And that is, is we have to look at where's the money going to? What's it going to fund? And in this particular instance, for example, if you look at the -- this Court's case law going back from Everson and all the way forward, it always said is the money going to a religious activity or is it going to a secular activity? This Court has approved funding to -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " -- religious schools, just not for religious activities. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So do you think, Mr. Cortman, suppose there was an application and a -- from a -- a church that used its playground for religious activities.   Had prayer services there, for example.   Could the State, in your view, deny the money on that ground, or at least would you think that that was a significantly different case? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I -- I think it would be a different case.   I would say the answer to the question would be I don't think they should, and here's why: I think there would be a -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That they -- I'm sorry. They don't think they should -- "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " They should be able to deny it on that ground.   And the reason I say that is, is all we're talking about is a -- is a surface, a safer surface on the playground for when -- when kids play. As was mentioned in one of the amicus briefs, I believe it was the World Vision brief, the surfacing being softer doesn't enable religious activities, it doesn't allow it, it doesn't prohibit it.   It's really completely separate and apart from it. And I think a good example would be something like this -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " How would you -- for example, one of the things that the Court has -- has thought about in the past is like computers for education.   So I guess somebody could make the same argument about computers.   Well, it doesn't really -- it's separate from the religious instruction that might be carried out over those computers. Do you think that that's the same, or is it different? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I -- I think it's actually easier than computers because you don't have to get into diversion and all the -- the concept this Court has talked about over the -- over the years in the Mitchell case and the other types of cases. And here the reason is, is that what we're talking about is just a surface.   It's not even the entire playground.   It's just the surface that doesn't enable any religious activity. So, for example, if there was a program from a State that said we have a lot of old buildings in town, and we're going to -- we're going to reimburse for fire extinguishers for all of the old buildings, including the religious schools and all the schools. And they said, but if -- if you have a religious school and you use this fire extinguisher reimbursement, could they then be able to say now that you received that -- that public benefit, that safety benefit, you can no longer include any religion in those classrooms or in the schools? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But don't you -- "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " And all my point -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I'm sorry.   Finish your sentence. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " All my point is I think that would be going too far because it's not advancing or furthering the religious activity.   It's separate and apart from it. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I'm not sure I understand your answer to the playground being used for a more religious activity.   Let's suppose that the public school sometimes uses its playground for things other than children playing, whatever they're going to have, a -- you know, an auction or anything else. Isn't it the consequence of your argument that the church can use the playground for more religious activities if the public school can use the playground for other non-playground activities? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I think it can.   And -- and I think that the key here is, is that -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I'm sorry.   You think it can what? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I think they should be able to -- I think both the public schools should be able to use it for other activities, and I think that the religious schools should be able to also. And -- and as I mentioned, I think the reason for that is it would be a penalty on the benefit to say because we're putting up a safer surface for when the kids play and fall, and that's the main activity here, if for some reason someone prays one day there or they decide to go outside for -- for one event, that doesn't -- it's not the government there who's advancing religion.   It's an incidental advancement that's -- that's done by the private party. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Would you say -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Are all of these questions really ones that verge onto the Establishment Clause; fire extinguishers, bible lessons on a sunny day, and so forth? Because we could go on and on.   Suppose you have an earthquake safety program for schools or -- or for -- for public -- or for buildings with large numbers of people.   And you have an earthquake -- in California, 40 percent of the cost of structure is earthquake-proof. Suppose they have earthquake reinforcement for a -- a church and have to spend extra money because there -- there's a window in the shape of a cross. That's all -- these are all establishment problems? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " They -- they are.   And interestingly in this case, the State concedes, and as did the lower court, there is no Federal Establishment Clause. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But -- see, but that's what makes the case a -- just a little bit -- in -- in -- in my last hypothetical about earthquake safety, any problem there with giving the money to a church and spending extra money for the cross in the window? It's all -- it's for public safety. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I think it would be an issue on the -- on the Establishment Clause, the question of the Establishment Clause.   But once you get to the fact that there is no Establishment Clause problem, which is what we have here, the question then is can you single out religious people or religious organizations for a penalty from this benefit? Or, as this Court said in McDaniel and Sherbert, is that you're forcing them to choose between exercising their religious faith and receiving the -- a public benefit. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I'm sorry -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Going back to my first question, that means what your position is, if there is no Establishment violation, there can never be a distinction based on religion. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I wouldn't say never.   We -- we -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Give me an example. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Well, play in -- what comes to mind is Locke v. Davey and play in the joints.   And the reason that's an important one there is because that was a narrow distinction that was based on, what this Court said, a unique historical interest.   And the Court also said that the program there went a long way to include religion.   Here, it closes religion right out at the door. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " We -- we did -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- but it does -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " We did say in this case -- well, I think you stipulated that this school has a nondiscriminatory admissions policy.   But suppose it didn't.   Suppose its policy was we prefer Lutheran children, and then if we have any space left over after that, we'll take other Christians.   And then after that, maybe Jews, and then everyone else.   Everything else is the same.   They want the paving of their playground. Could -- could this -- could they demand as a matter of Federal constitutional right that that playground be funded, even though they have an -- an admissions policy that favors members of their church? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I -- I think they can, because they have a -- they have a free exercise right to religious autonomy to decide who their members are.   In fact, most private organizations and religious organizations do so.   I -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So this church could say, we will take only Lutheran children. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I believe it can. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And -- and still get the public money. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I believe so, because we're still at the premise of -- of why are we making the church choose between exercising its religion, the same facts in McDaniel v. Paty, and saying he can't both be a minister and also be a constitutional delegate. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Mr. Cortman, do we know what Missouri -- how Missouri interprets the term \"church\" in its constitution? It speaks about church.   Does it have to be -- is this a matter of the form of the ownership of a facility? Is this playground considered to be -- by the State to be part of the church because of its proximity to the church? What if it was a -- what if we had a -- a religiously affiliated school that was not adjacent to a church and it had a playground.   Would they consider that to be part of -- would they consider that to fall within the prohibition? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I think it would depending on how religious it is.   And so what Missouri Supreme Court case law has -- says, number one, any -- any organization that's owned or controlled by a church.   So that answers the church part. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So if it's controlled. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " That's right. And also, any religious organizations that are sectarian or denominational.   And so it's not only the church, it's other religious organizations. And Missouri Supreme Court case law says the way we decide those questions is -- is -- is how much religious influence is there in a church? In other words, are they serious about their faith? Do they -- is it voluntary for the students there? And so there's a question about how religious you may be in order to receive the benefit or not.   But it's clear it applies to -- to religious organizations, and that's what their briefing has conceded, and to churches. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Cortman, my questions about religious uses, I think, was to get at a -- a broader point, a broader distinction, and asked -- ask what you think of it.   And as it seems that you are on strongest ground when you say, look, the State has decided to fund some activity, and it's denying that -- that funding to a particular party based solely on that party's religious status. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And that's the way you briefed the case. I hear you making a different argument, or a broader argument now, that extends into a State's decision to deny some uses -- to deny funding to some uses at the same time as it gives funding to other uses, and a State's decision to say, look, we really just don't want to fund religious exercise.   They can do religious exercise.   We don't want to fund religious exercise.   And I understand that you might think that's out of bounds, too.   But what I'm trying to figure out is, is there a distinction between these two things. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I don't think it's a broader argument that we're making.   What I'm -- what I'm trying to communicate is, is that when you look at what you're funding -- so this program says that you can't use this money for any religious activities and it has to go toward the playground resurfacing.   So it's actually a reimbursement grant whereas the church already lays out the finances.   Once it proves that it's put down the surfacing, then it puts its information in and gets reimbursed for it.   So the money has to be used for that. My only point is, is can the State then say, for example, in Everson and Allen, now that we've given you this bus transportation or these books, you can't engage in any religious activity once we've given you that separate benefit.   Not that you can't use the money for religious activity, which you cannot, and we don't -- we don't disagree with that.   The question is -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   So you don't disagree with that. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But the State is entitled to say you can't use this money for religious activity, and maybe I'll bring you a little bit further, we're entitled to take certain prophylactic measures to make sure that you don't use the money for religious activity. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Yes.   But -- I absolutely agree.   But once you take that benefit, I think it goes too far to say, like in Allen, for example, we're providing you with these textbooks, so you have to stop all religion in your school.   And that's all my point of -- that I was trying to -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, then how about the -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What does the record show about non-daycare or playground activities on this surface? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " There's -- there's nothing in the record that occurs except for children playing on the playground. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Excuse me, but you were talking about Locke -- "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- and how this is dissimilar from Locke. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, there is a tradition.   There are 39 States with constitutional amendments like the one Missouri has.   That's a history that's even longer than the Locke history.   And the essence of that history is, basically, we don't want to, as a country -- well, the vast majority of States, to fund houses of worship.   One would think that if there's play in the joints, that that would include the concept that States are free to say we don't want to spend money from the public FIs on houses of worship. Now, you say this affects free exercise.   We seem to be confusing money with religious practice.   I don't think the two are tied.   This church is not going to close its religious practices or its doors because its playground doesn't have these tires.   So I'm not sure how this is a free-exercise question, because there is no effect on the religious beliefs.   No one is asking the church to change its beliefs.   In fact, no one is asking the church as a condition of saying don't use what we give you for religious purposes; they're not even doing that.   They're just saying we don't want to be involved with the church. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Sure.   But there's -- there's government coercion when you say there's a public benefit, and the only way you could receive that public benefit is if you do not exercise your religion. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But why is that coercion with respect to your beliefs? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Because it's -- it's a choice, just like with McDaniel v. Paty.   He could not do both things simultaneously.   He could not -- Mr. McDaniel could not both be a minister and be a constitutional delegate, and what the court said forcing that choice -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But you can have a playground here. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " But you can't be -- you can't be a religious organization and have a playground. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You have a playground. No one is taking the playground away from you. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " No.   But you're -- you're being penalized by not receiving the public benefit -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " No.   The priest was being penalized.   The priest was being told you can't be a priest or a congressman.   So you can't do one or the other. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Here, there's nothing being taken away from. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Sure.   It's the same public benefit.   You can't be both, run this -- operate this daycare as a religious organization and receive the public benefit. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What do we do with discrimination for religion under your theory? Because the way you're going in your theory is an expansion of McDaniel; but putting aside that it's an expansion of McDaniel, what are we going to end up with when secular people say religious people are being discriminated in favor of and against us? If status should not be an effect on free exercise, what are we going to do with tax benefits? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What are we going to do with all the exemptions that churches receive? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Those are benefits. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Sure.   And I would say that the -- the clauses take care of that.   So, for example, if it goes too far and the government benefit is solely favoring religion, it's likely a violation of the Establishment Clause.   But we also have a -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, there's plenty of people who would think tax exemption goes too far. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But I don't.   I'm just saying there are people who make that claim. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Sure.   And the Court's already ruled on that.   And so on one side you have the Establishment Clause.   If you're going too far to favor religion, there's an Establishment Clause problem; but if you go the other side on the Free Exercise Clause, this Court has said for decades, sometimes we may and even must accommodate religion, and I think is the favorable treatment that Your Honor is talking about. But I think all the clauses work together in that route. If you take it too far, you do have an Establishment Clause problem. In this -- this case, it's considered there is no Establishment Clause problem, and -- and there is a point where you can accommodate religion, this other benefit, under the Free Exercise Clause, but I think they all balance out each other.   And in this particular case, it's not only McDaniel v. Paty, but McCauley specifically said that if you target religion on its -- on its face, which this policy does, then it's -- it's unconstitutional. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And Mr. Cortman, I don't know whether we -- excuse me.   I don't know whether we need to get into the history of this particular amendment here.   I tend to think we don't need to, but at the beginning of the line of questioning that Justice Sotomayor just finished, she began with the suggestion that perhaps this amendment reflects an admirable historical tradition that should be respected. Do you think that that is the proper way to analyze this question? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " I don't.   And -- and this -- this particular provision that we're discussing, they are -- and this has been briefed by several amicus briefs and -- and briefly by us, is a product of what we would consider to be one of the Blaine Amendments that was not found in Locke v. Davey.   And the reason for that is, is it has that same language in the Blaine Amendment.   It was adopted the same exact year, and there is much history showing about the anti-Catholic bigotry that's behind this specific provision, and several members of this Court have opined on that before.   So I think it doesn't carry the same history as -- as this general Establishment Clause, not -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " There is a serious debate about that, isn't there? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " There is.   And that's why our argument is, is we believe it is one, but it -- it doesn't matter to the deciding of this case. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Has the -- has the -- the State courts, have they ever said the amendment prevents the State from giving grants or from spending money on police protection for churches? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " They -- they have not, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Have they ever said that it prevents the State from, say, having a -- a border guard, you know, crossing guards or fire protection? Or, let's say, health inspections?

He said he's going to give you the grants.   He said that we know for four years this is going to recur anyway.   There's certainly -- of course, it could happen, somebody brings the case in the Supreme Court and they decide it differently in -- in -- in the State.

But I think that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " There's two -- there's two questions, isn't there? One is we're talking about is the case moot, and I think, technically, it's not moot.   But if we think -- suppose Missouri had a policy that it has today, very recently, and we were asked to grant cert in this case.   That would be a factor in our decision whether we thought this was an appropriate case to review, wouldn't it? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " This case would have to be here, I guess, in a different posture, maybe coming from the other side, if that was already the policy.   I think one of the problems is, is that the original policy was based on the Missouri Supreme Court's interpretation. So what's interesting here is there's already talk that the new policy is immediately going to be go challenged, and likely struck down by the Missouri Supreme Court.   So absent a ruling here, the -- the old policy will be back in place.   And that's why it's important for the Court to rule because it's not -- this isn't a permanent change by any means.   It's a temporary change.   In fact, the government is -- is actually defending both the old policy and the new policy, which I think shows why this Court needs to issue a ruling. And -- but I think what's likely to happen under the Voluntary Cessation Doctrine, especially as this Court has said, we look at this with a -- a critical eye because of the 11th hour change, is the State free to return to its old ways? It clearly is, not only in this administration, but in the new lawsuit being brought to challenge the new policy, because it violates why we're here in the first place, is the Missouri State constitutional provision. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " May I take you back to the substance, Mr. Cortman, unless anybody -- it's -- let's talk a little bit about federalism, and here's what I would like to know.   You know, usually when we see these funding cases, it comes in a different context.   It comes where the State wants to give money and somebody is objecting.   And this case comes in the converse way, where a State says we just don't want to fund -- "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- this institution.   And these -- these church/States divide, it's a -- it's a fraught issue.   It's a hard issue.   It's a -- it's an issue in which States have their own very longstanding law.   It's an issue on which I -- I guess I'm going to say nobody is completely sure that they have it right. And -- and so I guess there's something attractive about having some play in the joints where States can go their own way and make their own choices.   And why shouldn't this be one of those cases? "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Because I don't think this is one of the difficult cases.   In fact, I would say, with all the Court's jurisprudence under Free Exercise and Establishment Clause, this is actually one of the easier cases.   And the reason for that is if you look at the play in joints, the first conclusion was there was no Free Exercise violation there.   Here, there clearly is. If you look at the Court's case law under Sherbert and McDaniel and McCauley and Smith, this is clearly singling out a religious organization with no justification to do so.   So just having a Free Exercise violation takes it out of the play in the joints where there wasn't one there.

And here's what I would say, which I think is an easy solution.   Number one, the State doesn't have to set up the program in the first place.   Number two, it could set it up in a way that said, we're only going to do government schools' playgrounds and not any private schools. But once it sets up the program to include all not-for-profits and all not-for-profit preschools, it sets out 16 different criteria, neutral criteria, that everyone has to comply with.   Then the question is, is -- when you have a -- a religious organization that meets those criteria; in fact, does better on them than almost everybody else, and then you look at the application and say, well, we just found out you're operated by a religious organization, we're going to take you back out of that, even though you meet the State's criteria and further our interest better than almost everybody else, that seems to be not a difficult -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But one last -- I know your white light is on.   But might the State think that here's the problem.   The problem is this church has come in with a very competitive application.   We want to give money to this church.   Let's say, you know, a Protestant church.   There's a Catholic church across the street. Catholic church applies, doesn't get money, this happens five years running.   And people start thinking, well, why is the Protestant church keeping on getting the money and the Catholic church never gets the money? And the State says, we just won't -- don't want to sow that kind of division, that kind of mistrust, that kind of -- well, that -- "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Sure.   It sounds like a -- a reasonable observer question, but put that aside for a second.   If you know the history and context of the program, you would know that this is a competitive grant, and they actually should be religion blind. So if you're not looking at who is applying, you can grade this just like this application was graded highly, based on secular and neutral criteria.   So anyone knows that the program is purely religion blind, not looking at who's applying, they'll know that it's not favoring any religious organization or secular. But what you do when you favor -- when you remove the religious organizations, even though you've scored them high under your own competition, you're actually singling out for -- for a benefit they should otherwise get under Free Exercise.

In 1820, Missouri's first constitutional convention adopted from Jefferson's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom the language that, \"No man can be compelled to erect, support, or attend any place of worship.\" We modified that, made it more specific in the 1865 and 1875 constitutions.   And in 1945, it was reenacted in our latest constitution with reference back to the founding era. The -- the question, then, is whether that fits within this Court's jurisprudence under the First Amendment.

So one of them is a Federal nonprofit security grant program providing grants through the Department of Homeland Security to harden -- harden nonprofit organization facilities that are deemed to be at high risk for terrorist attacks.   So if you have a -- a synagogue that is at high risk for an attack by an anti-Semitic group or a mosque that is considered to be at high risk for attack by an anti-Muslim group, would the Missouri constitution permit the erection of bollards like we have around the court here?

As long as you're using the money for playground services, you're not disentitled from that program because you're a religious institution doing religious things.

We have a church that, in order to participate, has to agree to curriculum requirements in their preschool.

If she does, then under Missouri's liberal taxpayer standing rules, someone can then sue and say you are violating the State constitution.

It's not a perfect fit compared to some of the precedents, but -- but certainly there is no assurance that four years from now, with a change of administration, or at some point in the interim through a taxpayer standing suit, that there wouldn't be a -- a change back to the prior practice. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Mr. Layton, I'm struggling still to understand Justice Kagan's question, the answer to it. How is it that discrimination on the basis of religious exercise is better in selective government programs than general programs, first? And second, how do we tell the difference between the two, if that's the line we're going to draw? The tours, isn't it selective based on who can show up at the Capitol and afford to do that? Public benefit programs, aren't they often selective if you meet criteria? Copyright laws? You have to have an original work, things like that.   What do we do about those problems? "}, {"speaker": "James R. Layton", "text": " Well, I -- I still maintain my position that when we have a -- a -- a case where it is a selective program that is publicly announced, publicly visible, that that is different from these other kind of programs. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But how do we draw the line between selective and general? One -- one could seem to play with that line forever. "}, {"speaker": "James R. Layton", "text": " Well, one could, just like the rest of the lines in this case.   We don't get a -- a fine line -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, discrimination on the basis of status of religion, there's no -- no line-drawing problem there.   We know that's happened in this case, right? "}, {"speaker": "James R. Layton", "text": " We do know that the decision here was made because it was a church.   And assuming that's what \"status\" means, then I -- I suppose we -- we know that.   I mean, that's true. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If you -- if you make that the line, selective versus universal, if you like, you can reproduce the same problems.   Volunteer fire departments, most places that the State give grants to upgrade -- upgrade.   We don't have enough money, so we have a selection. Same with police.   You have crossing guards. You know, you have dangerous intersections.   There are crossing guards.   We have grants to help the schools pay for the children. Do the same thing with health of children. You know, I can do that.   That's what I see as a difficulty, we choose your line there, and we proliferate litigation forever. "}, {"speaker": "James R.

I can reproduce programs in the State that seem absolutely necessary for police protection, fire protection, health of children.

And you want to make that line the -- "}, {"speaker": "James R. Layton", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- constitutional line on Free Exercise? I'm afraid of that one.   Now, I put that out, so you can reply. "}, {"speaker": "James R. Layton", "text": " Well, the -- and -- and the answer would be that the line is some combination.   And I -- I can't give you a bright line, because you're rejecting the bright line that we have.   Some kind of combination of the endorsement problems with selectivity, and the entanglement problems that come when we're dealing with grant programs that actually affect the physical plant of a church and how that plant is used in a preschool or otherwise. There is no way for the State to comply with the -- its determination, maybe the requirement, that we police the use of the funds and what the funds here put on there without becoming involved with the church. There's a statement in the -- the Appellant's brief that says that the church is told that it can't participate in the life of the community, but what Trinity wants is to have the community participate in the life of the church.   And that is anathema to the kind of basic doctrines that we get out of the founding era that provided for a division -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Imagine, why would it be on the basis of a physical plant, as opposed to, say, personnel or nonphysical grant money? "}, {"speaker": "James R. Layton", "text": " Why -- why wouldn't what be? "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Now the line is moving. Now it's apparently on the basis of whether we're granting the money to physical plant or to some other purpose.   What is that -- "}, {"speaker": "James R. Layton", "text": " Well, no, I -- I'm saying that the physical plant is our case, because the physical plant is a -- a -- an improvement to the church property that the church will use and may use for actually proselytizing and not just use it for religious activities. And wherever the line is, that ought to be on the other side of the line, just like wherever the line is, writing a check that says payable to Trinity Lutheran Church ought to be on the other side of the line. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Layton. Mr. Cortman, you have three minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "David A Cortman", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just three points in rebuttal. First of all, as to the endorsement problem, I think the neutral government criteria here take care of the endorsement problem.   So when you have this competitive grant that you have to fill out this -- this pretty complicated application, 16 neutral criteria, there is no endorsement of religion.   I think the free speech cases give a good analogue to that. Number 2, as far as the selective or universal government benefit program, I don't think that is really the test here.   And the reason, as Your Honors mention, if this was open to all schools, and it was universal, they still would be prohibited from giving a grant to a religious organization.   So whether it's a narrow class of all non-for-profits, or a broader class of all schools, they would still not be able to fund based on their constitution. And lastly, as we talk about entanglement, this is not an entanglement issue.   Entanglement generally is an ongoing, intrusive surveillance.   It's not a one-time grant where you have to show a receipt for the expense to receive the reimbursement. If there are no other questions, I yield my time. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
