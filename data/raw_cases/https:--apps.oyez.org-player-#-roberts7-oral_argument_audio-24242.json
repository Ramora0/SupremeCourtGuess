[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-1256, Nelson v. Colorado. Mr. Banner. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a judgment is reversed, a person who has paid money pursuant to the judgment is entitled to get the money back.   That's common sense, and that has, unsurprisingly, been normal practice for centuries. As far as we can tell, Colorado is the first State ever to adopt a rule to the contrary.   In Colorado now, when a judgment of conviction is reversed, the State keeps the defendant's money unless the defendant files a separate civil action and can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that she's actually innocent. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What is the basis of -- of the right? You said the person whose conviction is overturned has a right to get the money back.   Is it a constitutional right? What kind of right is it? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " It's -- it's a right under the common law of property that's existed for centuries; that it has always been the case that a successful appellant gets her money back. In this case, the money was taken from Shannon Nelson and Lewis Madden pursuant to criminal convictions, but -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It has to be -- it -- it has to be constitutional if Colorado says we don't want to follow the common law.   This is not the law here. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Well, but -- but here -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " So -- so if it's not constitutional, then -- then what's the -- what's the basis for -- for your case? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No.   So here, the Colorado supreme court did not say that this money belongs to the State of Colorado.   Rather, the Colorado supreme court said the Exoneration Act is a good enough remedy for returning the money to Nelson and Madden. You're absolutely right, though, to say that if the Colorado supreme court had said it doesn't matter what process we use because it's not their property, it's the State's property.   If the Colorado supreme court had said that, then you're right.   Then we would be having to say -- making an argument that the Constitution itself gives the money -- gives a right to the money to Nelson and -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Make that argument. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Excuse me? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Make that argument. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Okay.   So if -- if Colorado -- if the Colorado supreme court had said that this money belongs to the State rather than to Nelson and Madden -- Madden, that would be tantamount to charging people money for the privilege of trying them unlawfully. Right? It would be the State taking money as a result of a trial that has been reversed, a trial that was conducted unlawfully.   That would -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The dissent here said something quite simple, which was the only entitlement to the money was the conviction. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If the conviction has been voided, then what legal right does the State have to retain the money? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " We agree with that exactly. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The Colorado supreme court, on the other hand, said when you paid the money, we were entitled to it.   So where -- there's a disconnect there. If they were entitled to it initially, we're still back to the operative question of why are they entitled? What is the constitutional right for you to get it back? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " The State was entitled to the money initially because there were judgments of conviction in place, judgments of conviction that required the payment of the money.   Those judgments of conviction no longer exist.   They were reversed on appeal.   Shannon Nelson was retried and was acquitted of all charges.   Lewis Madden convictions were reversed and the prosecutor declined to -- to retry the case.   And so while it was the State's money while the convictions existed, once those judgments of conviction cease to exist, at that point it's no longer the State's money. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I thought your argument was -- was this, but what you're saying now and a lot of your brief is much more complicated, but the simple argument I thought was this: This was your client's money.   It's a certain amount of dollars.   Okay.   It was taken away from them as a result of a trial that was flawed and therefore they were deprived of that property without due process of law.   I thought that was the argument. Am I right or not? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " You're right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Okay.   Now, if that is the argument, there are two complications that I see in your briefing.   One is that you concede that they could be denied restitution for equitable reasons.   Let's just take that. Where -- where else in the law of due process would something like that come up? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " We -- we -- the reason why we said that is that in several of -- of this Court's older cases, the Court describes these refunds as equitable. Now, in a -- in a garden variety -- in garden variety criminal cases like this one, there would be no equitable considerations that would interfere with a refund of the money. But there -- there are -- it's possible to imagine other sorts of cases where it would.   And so, for example, the Court -- as this Court mentioned, as we say in the -- in the reply brief, this Court mentioned an example in which an insurance case in which a refund -- a full refund would provide overcompensation for some reason to -- to the successful appellant, and in such a case, the refund for equitable reasons would have to be scaled back. In an ordinary criminal case like -- like ours, there's nothing like that.   Those -- those sorts of equitable considerations are very, very far from -- from -- from a case like this one.   And, you know, Colorado talks -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If that's right, and this is the basic argument, it's our money by virtue of State law, and once the conviction disappears, why doesn't the State have to proactively return the money? In other words, why is it even required for the person to bring any kind of refund action against the State? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No.   The State does proactively have to refund the money.   There -- there is no requirement for the successful appellant to bring -- to bring an action.   Rather, the -- what the -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So your complaint is not to the nature of this action and to exactly what you have to prove.   You're saying that as soon as the conviction is vacated, the State has to put a check in the mail. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Well, okay.   That may be a little too -- a little too simple.   So that the -- in our view the -- the -- a proper procedure would be the procedure that was followed in these cases, where, after -- in Shannon Nelson's case, after she was acquited, she filed a motion back in the original trial court saying, look, I've been acquited, please give me my money back. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " No.   I guess I'm asking, if your theory is right, why is even that necessary? If your theory is right, it seems -- I mean, you know -- you know, you might file a motion because the State hasn't done what it's supposed to do, but it seems as though the obligation on the State's part is immediately to put a check in the mail. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No, that's right.   That's right.   That's right.   And so when that hadn't happened after several months we filed the motions in both cases. Well, the -- the other -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I was just -- I -- I understood you in responding to Justice Alito to say that the State had to give the money back because they'd acquired it as a result of a flawed prosecution.   Is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, that's not true for some of the payments.   You know, there's a $30 docket fee.   In other words, that's not something that depends upon whether the conviction is valid or not in the normal case. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Well, yes.   Well, in -- in -- under the -- all of these payments under Colorado law are collected only from defendants who are convicted. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Including the docket fee? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Including the docket fee, right.   None of these -- none of these -- none of these fees, charges, et cetera, are the sorts of -- sort of filing fees that are collected from any litigant, win or lose.   There's nothing like that in this case.   This is all money that is contingent upon the existence of a conviction. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " The other complication that I see in this make-whole argument, in other words, the State took things away from you, they took property away from you, and when the conviction is reversed, they have to restore you to the position you were in before the prosecution.   Is this, the -- the restitution and all of these fees are small in comparison with the main thing that was taken away, and that was -- that was liberty. So if your argument is correct, why shouldn't this -- what -- did -- didn't the State -- the State took away your clients' liberty without due process of law, so would they be automatically entitled to be made whole in that respect? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No.   And the reason -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why not? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " The reason -- I'm -- I'm getting -- the reason for that is that while there's a long historical tradition of providing refunds of monetary payments upon the reversal of the conviction, there is no comparable tradition of providing compensation for periods of lost liberty. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " That's why Colorado passed the Exoneration Act. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Exactly.   Exactly.   If there -- if there already was a tradition of providing compensation for lost liberty, there'd be no need for statutes of exoneration -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if tradition -- I mean, if tradition like that can defeat the argument for compensation for time wrongfully spent in prison, then can tradition defeat the argument that you make with respect to the fees and the restitution? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No, because the tradition is -- is the -- the normal practice for centuries has been to refund monetary payments that are contingent upon a judgment when that judgment -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Oh, okay.   So the argument is tradition could do it if there were such a thing. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " If there were such a thing, if the opposite -- right.   And so it's a -- it's a -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But we have to look at the tradition. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Can we look at the tradition again? It seems to me for constitutional reasons, not for State law reasons, that's where I'm somewhat confused. I mean, who -- who cares about tradition if the State says X and the tradition is Y, unless there's a constitutional -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No, no, that's right.   That's right.   That's right.   And so -- and so tradition -- tradition comes in, you know, in -- in determining what process is due, courts always -- always look to tradition.   Tradition is -- is always a factor in considering what would -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Getting back to the State law for a moment. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Are -- are you saying that if a State creates a right under State law, it cannot unduly complicate that right by flawed procedures, under our procedural due process jurisprudence? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Well, I'd say it even more simply than that.   I would say that when a State is holding onto property that belongs to one of its citizens, the State has an obligation to have a procedure that is adequate for returning the property. I mean, that's the -- that's the error that we're complaining about in the Colorado supreme court. Below, the supreme court said the -- the Colorado supreme court analyzed this as a procedural due process case.   The court said the question is: Is the Exoneration Act a good enough procedure for returning this money to Nelson and Madden? The Colorado supreme court applied Mathews v. Eldridge and the State cases following Mathews v. Eldridge, and the Colorado supreme court determined yes, this is a good enough process for returning the money to Nelson and Madden. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, then your -- I think your argument has moved from the simple one I started out with, which is that you're absolutely entitled to be made whole, to the argument that they have to provide -- that we look to tradition and we have -- we have to see what sort of tradition is adequate. So what would be an adequate procedure here? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " They -- they have to be made whole -- I guess I don't think I'm saying anything different from what you're saying.   I'm saying that what the Due Process Clause requires is for Colorado to provide a process adequate to make defendants whole when their convictions -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So what is that process after the conviction is reversed? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Well, I'm simply -- simply to refund the money.   It's their money.   Colorado can't make defendants have to prove that they're actually innocent in order to get their own money back. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I thought -- let's -- let's take the act.   What parts of the procedure of the act are you saying violate due process? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Well, the -- the requirement of proving one's innocence in order to get one's own money back.   That's -- that's the most -- that's the most obvious one. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It would seem to me that if the State had an equitable reason, it should prove it, not you. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Oh, exactly.   Exactly.   And as I've said, the State talks a lot in very general terms about equitable principles, but the State has yet to identify what equitable principle entitles to not refund the money. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Do you think the requirement to start a separate civil action comports with due process? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " That's -- that's a harder question.   So let's imagine a requirement that you have to file a separate civil action, but all you have to prove is that your conviction was reversed, right? If it was -- if it was something that -- that ministerial, maybe.   Maybe that would satisfy due process.   Although even there, I suppose, it would be hard to see what purpose would be served by such an action when you -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You'd have to get -- pay a filing fee -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You would have to engage a lawyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And we're talking about hundreds of dollars, not even a thousand in one case. So -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- if any -- it seems to me any requirement that you sue to get the money back. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " I agree.   I agree.   As I was saying, it would have to be a very streamlined -- some very streamlined, very easy sort of civil action.   But you -- that would be pointless.   I mean, it would be hard to see what purpose would be served by requiring such an action.   I'm agreeing with you.   What purpose would be served by that when you can just do what appellants have been doing -- successful appellants have been doing for centuries, which is going back to the trial court and saying, okay.   Judgment reversed. Please give us our money back. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I assume you apply the Mathews framework.   Do you agree that the court got it right, or do you think even under Mathews the court below got it wrong? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Oh, no.   Under Mathews, the Court got it terribly wrong.   I mean, the -- the Colorado supreme court's application of Mathews was basically to say due process requires some kind of a hearing.   Well, the Exoneration Act, that gives you some kind of a hearing, so good enough. If you look at the -- the Mathews factors one by one, they all point very, very strongly in -- in favor of finding the Exoneration Act an inadequate remedy. It's -- first of all, this is -- this is the defendants' property, not the State's property. Second of all, this is a terrible procedure for returning property to -- to successful appellants. The Exoneration Act act was not really intended to serve that purpose.   It doesn't serve that purpose at all. It's -- it's -- virtually ensures that successful appellants aren't going to get their money back when their convictions are reversed. And, finally, it's -- it's impossible to see what interest the State has in holding onto this money; right? Nelson -- Shannon Nelson's -- she was acquitted. Lewis Madden, his convictions were reversed.   There -- there -- there's no chance that either of these defendants will ever be re-prosecuted.   This money will never belong to Colorado.   Colorado has yet to explain what interest it has in preventing this money -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " If we're writing -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " -- from being returned. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " If we're writing this opinion and we begin, \"Tradition is very important here,\" because? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Well, in the Court's due process cases, the Court has often said that tradition -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " That's -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " -- is very important.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " That's if we're trying to define the substantive right. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Yeah.   Right.   And -- and also in determining what -- what process is due.   And so -- so the -- the fact that successful appellants have always gotten their money back, I mean, that's -- that is -- that -- that is the tradition that -- that we're invoking. And tradition is important in -- in due process cases because, you know, in -- in determining what -- what process is due in determining what's the law of the land, well, what -- what better place to look than what the law of the land has always been. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, so that's a different analysis than the Mathews analysis, though. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Correct. You know, the thing about this case is that what Colorado is doing here has never been done before. So there is no precedent directly on point at a very high level of specificity.   So we have to look to other lines of the Court's due process precedent.   That's what we've done. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, it -- it seems, Mr. Banner, that you could be approaching this in two ways.   I mean, one is you could be claiming a substantive due-process right along the lines that Colorado said you were doing, and then you came back and said no.   Now, if you were suggesting that you had a substantive due-process right, then surely tradition would be important. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But in -- if you're looking at procedural due process, I would have thought that your argument is the simple one of: This is property under State law; it's -- it's my property, it's your client's property.   And then we apply the Mathews test to determine what kind of procedure is due -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- to get that property back.   And tradition -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- wouldn't be any part of that. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No, that's right.   And so if -- looking just at the Mathews test, you're absolutely right.   Tradition would not be part of that.   But the Mathews test is not the only way the Court has looked at this general class of issues.   And as I said, because -- because no State has ever done what Colorado is doing, they're -- we're -- we're trying to draw from various strands of due process precedent.   One strand is the Mathews test. But there -- another strand is the -- you know, the cases like Honda Motor and so on that say if a State takes away a procedure that has traditionally been present, traditionally been afforded, that's a pretty good sign that the State is violating due process. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What did Colorado do before the Exoneration Act with respect to returning -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Just -- just gave back the money just like every other jurisdiction.   That's right. And so the -- the novelty here is that this case got to the Colorado supreme court immediately after the Exoneration Act was enacted, and the Colorado supreme court said, oh, now we have a statute that tells how money is supposed to be refunded to exonerated defendants.   Under State law, that must be now the exclusive remedy for defendants to recover the money. But before -- before the Exoneration Act, there -- there was no statute governing this -- this topic, just like in many jurisdictions.   And in -- just as a matter of routine practice, successful appellants got their money back. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, is that true? I mean, I still don't understand the difference between the simple argument that you're required to be made whole and the argument that a court could deny restitution based on equitable considerations as this court has said. So which is your argument? You automatically get it back; that's the end of it.   You don't -- no procedure is necessary -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- or that you could be denied receiving the money back for equitable reasons? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " You automatically get it back unless there is some equitable reason that you shouldn't get it back.   But what I'm trying to say is in an ordinary criminal case like this one, there is no equitable reason why you shouldn't get it back and it's impossible almost to conceive of an equitable reason. The reason why -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, what if the State says that you -- that the defendant has the obligation to move for a stay of the judgment of restitution when the defendant takes an appeal, and if the defendant doesn't do that, then the money is not refunded? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Yeah.   That's -- that is impossible under State law for indigent defendants to seek a stay of monetary payments pending appeal for two reasons. One is that you have to -- to get a stay pending appeal, you have to post a bond in the full amount of the payment.   That's way out of reach for any indigent defendant.   In fact, we talked to experienced Colorado defense lawyers who say they have never heard ever of any indigent defendant seeking a stay of monetary payments pending appeal.   Our clients, indigent defendants, they couldn't -- they couldn't have done that. Second, by statute, stays appear to be unavailable where the money is being taken from the -- appellant's inmate accounts, which is the case here.   So even -- even if they had some sort of money outside of their inmate accounts -- excuse me.   I'm sorry.   The money had been taken from the inmate account, so -- so that's the second reason why a stay would be unavailable. I should add -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Should we be -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Should we be differentiating between some jurisdictions that don't collect the money until the conviction is final and a conviction that's overturned on collateral review where the possibility of money having been collected may exist? Should there be a difference in how we think about those two situations? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No, because -- because whatever the reason for the disappearance of the judgment of conviction, the key thing is that these are -- these are -- the State's only right to this money is in the judgments of conviction.   And so regardless -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, I have a problem because there are some cases in our jurisprudence -- not in English jurisprudence, but certainly in American jurisprudence where the payment of restitution to a third party would have been good reason, an equitable reason for the State not to have to return that money. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Yeah.   Let me -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what do we do -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Let me -- let me say -- let me say a word about -- about restitution in -- restitution in the -- in the modern sense of restitution.   I mean, restitution -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Paying the victim. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " -- to victims.   Right.   Right, right, right. Restitution in -- in Colorado is -- you can only have restitution pursuant to a criminal conviction. Without a criminal conviction, there can be no restitution.   There's no separate proceeding.   There's no separate proof apart from the amount of restitution; otherwise, it's just -- it's just part of the sentence. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " What do States generally do if they've collected this money, they've paid it out to the victim, and then the conviction is overturned? Do they usually leave the money with the victim and just take it out of their general treasury, or do States try to take it back from the victim? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " That -- that, I do not know. And the thing is there -- there are very few reported cases raising the issue of refunds of restitution after the reversal of a conviction.   And I think the reason it must be that restitution, although -- restitution to victims, although quite old in principle, really has only been applied in significant amounts recently. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But your argument is that if -- let's say there's a very substantial judgment of restitution and the money is paid to the victims.   Let's say they're victims like the ones in this case, so it's -- it's therapy -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- for abuse. And then even after the judgment has become final, if there is -- if -- if the defendant is given relief on collateral review, the State would have to -- would have to compensate the defendant for all the money that was paid to the victims.   That's your argument? "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " I -- well, I agree with all of that except for the word \"compensate.\" The State would have to refund the amount of money it had taken from the defendant. Remember that -- that -- I mean -- and then as between the State and the victims, that's between -- that's -- that's between the State and the victims. That's no -- there's no bearing on the -- the property rights or the due process rights of the defendant. Bear in mind that all the money the State collects from convicted defendants, whether denominated restitution or denominated anything else, all of that money the State is spending on something.   The State -- the State isn't hiding that money under a mattress.   All of that money, even -- even fines paid into a State's general fund, the State is spending that money on something. And so it's -- it's no excuse when -- to -- when you -- when you owe a debt to say, oh, gees, I'm sorry, I already spent the money on something else. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, you don't have to make that argument to prevail in this case, do you? I think there's -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " -- some severe equitable problems with -- with the -- with the hypothetical of the State having paid the -- the victim and the victim having spent the money. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " No, no.   You -- you misunderstand me.   The State is saying -- I'm not talking about the victim spending the money.   I'm -- I meant to be talking about the State saying, well, I'm sorry, we can't -- we can't -- upon the reversal of a conviction, the State saying we -- we can't refund the money, sorry, we already disbursed it as restitution to the victims. And what I'm saying is the State disburses all the money it collects for one purpose or another. That doesn't set restitution apart from anything else. If I could reserve the balance of my time.

Then they could sue for a constitutional tort.   In fact, a significant case from Colorado had exactly that.   A criminal defendant sued for a Brady violation and received millions of dollars in compensation.

There would be a claim for compensation due to a wrongful defect in the due process in the procedures that led to that deprivation.

The court hadn't really encountered this situation before, and so it looked and it found only the Exoneration Act.   So what it concluded is that as a matter of substance, compensation like the kind of compensation that Petitioners are seeking in this case is available only on a claim of actual innocence. So I'm -- I'm agreeing with you because, yes, the -- the statute is that narrow, but the Colorado supreme court determined that as a matter of law, this is -- this is public property and there must be a -- a proper claim for compensation against state funds and there wasn't one in this case.

Yarger", "text": " Chief Justice Roberts -- or, excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, if this is their property, if they have a present entitlement to it, it is their property, then due process requires them some procedure to get it back, and that's the question. Is this, as a matter of substantive law, their property or public funds as the Colorado supreme court held, and, therefore, there's -- there can only be a mechanism for compensation from public fund for those losses? And so that is the key question in this case. If there are no further questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Yarger. Mr. Banner, you have four minutes. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Okay.   Just a couple of -- a couple of quick things. First of all, this -- I believe that this argument is the first time in this litigation that the State has come out and said, \"This is -- this money belongs to the State.\" The Colorado supreme court did not say that.   The Colorado -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It doesn't say the opposite either.

"}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " But -- but -- but the -- what the Colorado supreme court did was to skip over that question and proceed straight to the next logical question that would occur if it was -- the money was our property, which is, is the Exoneration Act an adequate procedure for returning it? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Because that could be consistent with the money's their property, but they have an obligation to give it back. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Not really, because -- because if it was -- if the -- if the -- if the money is the State's property, then it doesn't matter.   They don't have to provide any procedure to give it back; right? So the -- the question with the -- that the Colorado supreme court actually decided, the one thing -- the issue -- I mean, the part of the decision that we're attacking is that this is an adequate procedure for the return of the property.   Okay.   That's my first point.   The -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " They use the word \"return\"?

Breyer", "text": " I'm looking for something here in the opinion that will -- that I could just say, \"Okay.   See? They concede that it is this man's property.   They concede it.\" But I haven't found that sentence.   That's my -- "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " Well, unfortunately, they don't explicitly concede it.   They assume it, is what -- is what we would say. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " I know that's not helpful to you. All right.   The other -- the other -- the other -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Stuart Banner", "text": " The other quick point I want to make is, I just want to explain very briefly why sovereign immunity has never been thought to be -- provide any bar to these refunds.   And that is, we're not asking for the right to bring a new lawsuit against the State.   The State already brought these suits against us when it charged Nelson and Madden with crimes; right? We're not -- we're not seeking a new judgment against the State.   We already have judgments in these cases, judgments in our favor.   We won.   And yet the State is holding on to our money as if we lost. We're not seeking compensation.   We're just seeking a refund of the money that we paid pursuant to judgments that no longer exist.
