[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 21-806, Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County versus Talevski. Mr. Robbins. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The key to Spending Clause statutes, this Court said in Arlington Central School District, \"is what the states are clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the acceptance of federal funds.\" Among the most costly conditions that may go along with the acceptance of federal funds is exposure to private litigation under Section 1983.   This Court made that precise point in Barnes against Gorman, in which it said with respect to a school that \"without doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the most significant factors a school\" -- or, as in this case, a nursing facility -- \"would consider in deciding whether to receive federal funds.\" States are therefore entitled, in our view, to clear notice that they will be subject to such private lawsuits if they expect -- if they accept Spending Clause money.   Such a clear notice rule comports with the federalism and separation-of-powers principles at stake in these cases, and it accords as well with the common law treatment of third-party beneficiary claims at the time Section 1983 was enacted. At common law, third parties generally could not sue to enforce government contract rights unless the contract clearly specified that the breaching party would be liable to injured third parties.   Because the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act contains no such clear statement, it should not give rise to Section 1983 liability.   But, even if a clear notice rule is not required, the two purported rights that Respondent invokes under FNHRA do not give rise to Section 1983 claims. First, FNHRA and its implementing regulations provide a comprehensive suite of remedies, including a more restrictive private remedy that forecloses Section 1983 relief under Rancho Palos Verdes.   And on this dispositive point, the U.S. Solicitor General agrees with us. Second, the two rights Respondent invokes are not unambiguously phrased in terms of the persons benefited.   Instead, the two rights invoked here today are but a small piece of an overarching set of requirements addressed to nursing facilities that receive federal money.   And the command to protect and promote those rights are, as in Blessing, system-wide commands, not an unambiguous assurance of individual entitlement. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " What do you mean -- what do you mean by \"system commands\"? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " In the -- that, as in Blessing, the language of the statute, Mr. Chief Justice, is directed to the rights of -- the -- the -- the obligation of the nursing facility to take care of the entire system and not focus on any particular individual. The language, \"protect and promote,\" to promote something, it seems to me, evokes the notion that you are looking out at the whole system in which you promote and protect a certain right. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " No, I -- I -- I -- I think you have a stronger argument on \"promote,\" though, than you have on \"protect.\" "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " And -- and the -- the -- the statute uses both and then, you know, lists a variety of rights.   And it seems to me that if you're supposed to protect those rights and you're the person who's responsible for conferring -- living up to those rights, that -- that seems to me that it ought to be sufficiently direct under -- under Blessing or Gonzaga or any of the others. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well -- well, I -- I -- I'm not inclined to think so, though, to be sure, I think our -- the stronger of our two Gonzaga arguments is the middle -- is the Sea Clammers preclusion argument.   That's our -- that's our first submission with respect to the Question 2. What I would say with respect to the Chief -- Your Honor's question, it is a mistake, I think, to pick out the particular clauses that embody these two rights and divorce them from the rest of the statute.   Pennhurst, after all, enjoins the Court to look at the whole statute. And when you do that, when you look at the whole statute, the entirety of the FNHRA amendments, what you're going to see is that the core of it, contained in subsections (b), (c), and (d), are a series of commands to the nursing home to regulate and manage its facility in a particular way. (c) refers to the nursing home's ability -- responsibility to protect and promote certain rights.   That's true. (b), on the other hand, talks about administrative obligations, as does (d), whereas (e) and (f) are directed, respectively, to the states and to the federal government, to the Secretary. That is to say, each one of the substantive sections of these amendments is directed to the particular office or officer that has the duty to promote the underlying obligations.   And so I would say that even though it's true -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Except -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, that's true -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess I'm just not sure, Mr. Robbins, what that -- what that gets you.   It's a big statute.   It does a lot of things.   But one of the things it does is to say every nursing facility has to ensure that individual rights are respected and lays out in considerable detail what those rights are and say it's your job to see that those rights are fulfilled. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yeah.   Well, again, it is our view that, taken as a whole, this -- these are directions to the nursing facilities. Even subsection (c), which is the -- the one in which these rights can be found, begins with the command: the nursing home shall. And -- and so, you know, if you're asking the question -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, it's true that the nursing home is involved in this because the nursing home is the entity that's supposed to respect the individual rights that are laid out. I mean, you have to think that any individual right imposes a correlative duty on somebody. And, here, it's the nursing home that is supposed to make sure that those rights are not violated. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " I -- I don't disagree with that at all, Justice Kagan.   What I do think, however, is that -- and, again, this is on the assumption now that we're talking about the Gonzaga inquiry. My threshold argument is based on the common law at the time Section 1983 was enacted and on federalism and separation-of-powers principles.   But, if we are now in the guts of Question 2, I would suggest that the individual patient is not the unambiguous focus of this statute. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " It says rights.   I mean, it says rights.   It's very uncomfortable fact for you is that -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

It did in Pennhurst itself with a long section of bill -- called Bill of Rights in Section 6010 of the Rehab Act of '73. That wasn't enough.   The Chief -- then Chief Justice Rehnquist said for the Court that we don't pick out little words like \"rights,\" a point repeated by this Court in 2002 in Footnote 7 of Gonzaga. The mere fact that the word \"right\" is sprinkled through the statute -- obviously, I don't dispute that -- is not enough to get you over the unambiguous focus hurdle. But let me be clear.   Of the three arguments I'm making today, I promote two ahead of that, and on -- on those points, I think there is not a -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What's your -- what's your first argument then? That we should overrule the precedent, right? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, the first argument is that it should extend the principle in Gonzaga to take account of the sate -- the state of third-party beneficiary law at the time 1983 was enacted.   That is our answer on Question 1. On Question 2, we have two answers, but the first of those is that this is a case of Sea Clammers preclusion, that the set of remedies provided in subsection (h)(8) provides a comprehensive -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But, in Sea Clammers, there's a citizens suit provision, right? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Indeed.   But this Court has twice now taken account of the Sea Clammer and its progeny and twice, once in Rancho Palos Verdes and once in Fitzgerald, has said that the dividing line between what is preclusive and what is not is whether there is a private remedy, not a private judicial remedy, much less a private federal court remedy, a private judicial remedy. That's what this Court has twice said is the dividing line in that body of law.   There is no question, no even fair debating that there is a set of private remedies, which is -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Private judicial remedies or private administrative remedies? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Private administrative remedies. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Okay.   And we've said that the existence of a state administrative remedy does not ordinarily reclose -- foreclose resort to 1983.   The Solicitor General quotes that -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- portion as well.   And I just want you to respond to that. How do we -- how do we address that? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, first off, these are -- these are not simply state remedies. They are remedies that both the Secretary can enforce, including the right to bring a grievance to the Secretary and a grievance to state officials. But I would -- I -- I -- I would say, Justice Kavanaugh, that the -- you know, I really do insist on the dividing line that this Court has articulated more recently than the -- than the language that you've quoted. It seems to me Fitzgerald -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Can you get -- I'm sorry to interrupt.   I don't want to take too much time. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " No, that's fine. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But that's a key point for me on the comprehensive scheme argument, which is what exactly is the dividing line? I mean, I've got the cases.   I've read the cases.   What do you think is exact formulation of the dividing line? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " I think, if I'm reading the two cases I've just cited correctly, and I think I'm quoting -- citing the -- the language almost verbatim, in fact, I think it uses the phrase \"the dividing line\" if I'm not mistaken in both Fitzgerald and Rancho Palos Verdes. And what the Court has said is, if there is a private remedy -- in fact, in one of the cases, I can't now recall, it actually says judicial or administrative. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " You think any private remedy at all is -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " No, no, I -- I -- I -- I don't think so.   I mean -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Because I had thought that we looked for some understanding of incompatibility, that we looked for some ways in which the other private remedy was in conflict or in -- at least in tension with 1983. So, in those cases that you're citing, those cases all had remedial schemes which had various requirements.   They forced you to give notice, they required you to file at a certain time, things like that. And if you gave a 1983 suit, it would be of a -- a way of evading all those requirements so that you could see that there was some kind of tension between the remedial scheme and 1983. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " I -- I -- I -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But I don't see any of that here. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " But I -- respectfully, Justice Kagan, I don't think that's the way this Court has thought about the preclusiveness of remedies. I don't contend that 1983 is somehow flatly inconsistent with the exist -- with the comprehensive remedies provided under (h)(8) and -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Or even in tension with or even that -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " But -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- 1983 would pro -- would give you an out -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " No -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- and -- and -- and -- and so you could escape the requirements of a different remedial scheme. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, I think there are respects in which that's true here.   For example, there are provisions that require that that the Secretary -- as I recall, there are provisions that require -- that -- that give, for example, the states discretion as to whether they're going to exercise any of their remedies, including because, for example, they're -- they're managing the facility, they're looking it over and they -- they don't want to terminate a -- a funding or they want to take some more -- lesser step. I would contend that private litigation, which, of course, is not constrained in that way, is, in fact, antithetical to the discretion that states and the Secretary have. But I also quarrel with the premise, Your Honor.   I do not think I have to show that 1983 is -- and I -- is -- is at odds or even in tension with the -- with the elaborate administrative proceedings provisions given here. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, aren't we trying to figure out -- I mean, this is a matter of statutory interpretation -- we're trying to figure out whether Congress meant to preclude the 1983 suit. And it can't be the case that Congress would mean to preclude the 1983 suit by doing any old thing.   I mean, other administrative remedies can be perfectly complementary -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- with a 1983 suit. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " I -- I under -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So we have to be looking for something more than that Congress has provided some other remedial avenues. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I think in this case it's quite comprehensive.   And what's striking about this case, of course, is that Mr. Talevski availed himself of all of those provisions, got the relief he wanted, and then came back to court for money. So it -- this is a case where the -- where the actual regulations did a terrific job. But, again, let me just finish why I quarrel with Your Honor's premise. To me, if I -- when -- as I read the body of law that was started with Sea Clammers and goes through Robinson and then up to City of Palos Verdes, what the Court has said is we usually begin with the assumption that the provision of one remedy excludes the others. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I don't think that that's the presumption here.   I think, once there has been found to be a statute with the character of giving rights, the presumption actually is in favor of 1983 because that's what 1983 is supposed to address. And we're looking to see whether another statute negates that presumption by doing something particular, that suggests that Congress wouldn't have wanted nine -- the 1983 to go forward -- 1983 suit to go forward at the same time. So we need something more than another scheme that does something.   We need a sense that that other scheme was meant to be exclusive, that it was -- that -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- that it -- it -- it would have been thought to be incompatible with 1983. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I would take a page from the Solicitor General's argument, of course, that it would -- it is surpassingly odd to imagine that we would have more exacting obligations on the very thin slice of state nursing homes that get federal money under this program.   I'm going to leave that argument to them, and I hope they make it. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Mr. Robbins, can I just give you -- and are you finished with this? I'm sorry.

If the statute -- if there is an enforceable right, which -- with which, of course, I quarrel, but, if there is, it is true that there's a presumption that 1983 kicks in, unless, of course, you take my view of the first question presented, which is that, as a general matter, 1983 did not permit third-party beneficiaries to be -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " That -- that's what I wanted to talk about.

And it exists notwithstanding the fact that it becomes our burden to sustain -- that -- that -- to -- to -- our burden to show that 1983 is not available.   One -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

On the alternative remedy for grievances, does it matter that what you rely on the most is an administrative regulation rather than the statutory language? Because, obviously, the statutory language, you can analyze that as what the state had -- was on notice about or -- or not, but I don't know that that's true with respect to subsequent regulations. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, I -- I think our view is that if a regulation fairly interprets the statute, then that counts towards the same preclusive effect that the statute would. Nobody contests that proposition in front of the Court today.   Nobody says that a regulation can't have the same preclusive effect. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I would contest that proposition since the whole premise is that the state has to be on unambiguous, clear notice.   But how can that be with respect to a regulation that hasn't even been issued at the time of the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Well, I -- I'm not sure that the contract metaphor -- I mean, this Court has said in case after case that the contract metaphor is to -- is to limit the scope, not to expand the scope. I'm not sure why a state would need to know that a 1983 -- I'm not sure why the -- the state would need to know what the regulations are -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, because -- "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " -- all about. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " -- you're talking about contract.   The regulations can go two different ways.   One could be a -- a regulation that expands the obligations of the state, rather than the one at issue here. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes.   No, I -- I -- I -- I recognize that.   But, I guess, if what we're talking about is what the states clearly understood as a condition, I would then recur to my central argument on Question 1, which is that no state would have thought that a private party could enforce the contract that consists of FNHRA because it doesn't advert in any way to the right of a private party to bring a lawsuit.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, Respondent relies on the Savings Clause, and you -- you responded only very briefly to that in the reply brief, so I wanted to give you another chance to talk about it. The Savings Clause says \"the remedies provided under this subsection are in addition to those otherwise available under\" -- \"for federal law and shall not be construed as limiting such other remedies.\" Why doesn't that apply directly here? It doesn't say -- the provision does not say that the right that is asserted must arise from some source other than the law at issue.   It -- it supplements remedies. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It says that this does not take away remedies.   And 1983 provides a remedy. "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Yes.   I appreciate it, Justice Alito, and let me -- let me provide two -- two answers on that. The first is both in Rancho Palos Verdes and in I want to say at least one other of the -- this Court's cases, maybe it's -- it's Robinson, the Court has said that when we refer -- when a savings -- so-called Savings Clause refers to federal law or federal statute, it is referring to statutes other than the very one that contains the Savings Clause.   That's our first submission. But I'd like to follow on to that because I think, if it -- if that's correct, the Savings Clause is our friend, not theirs, and the reason is this: It says in essence the rights in this section, (h)(8), which I have invoked as preclusive, the rights contained in (h)(h) -- (h)(8) are in addition to those in statute -- in federal statutes. If \"federal statutes\" means all statutes other than FNHRA itself, then that seems to me pretty strong evidence that there are no other remedies except those found in, for example, the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act of '73. That is to say, the Savings Clause says are -- these rights are for any other federal -- are in addition to other federal statutes.   That seems to me to preclude the argument that they are relying on, which is an argument that 1983, married with FNHRA, gives them certain rights. I think the fair reading of the Savings Clause is against that combination, precisely because its reference to statutes is to statutes other than FNHRA, and without FNHRA, they've got no 1983 claim in this case.

But, if you look at Footnote 22 of the principal source they rely on, you will see that the author cut out from his sample all the so-called \"incidental beneficiary cases,\" which are the ones we say are most like a Spending Clause statute. In other words, the game was rigged. It -- the -- the -- the -- the denominator was gerrymandered to gin up very high numbers, but, if you go back and look at all of the government-to-government contract cases, and I've looked at a fair bit of them, you will find that unless the government contract called out the plaintiff, for example, Schnaier, the Schnaier case from 1918 in New York, or the Little -- the Little case that it cites from 1880, in those cases, they said -- you know, these were the water company and fire company cases of the 19th century -- generally speaking, if your house burned down because the water company didn't put enough water in the hydrants, you were out of luck.

And this Court has said in several cases that the reference to statutes is to statutes other than the very statute containing the Savings Clause. That means other than FNHRA.   And if it means other than FNHRA, which is the way I read it and the way this Court has read it more than once, then they have no claim because -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Okay, counsel, I understand.

The question about third-party beneficiaries and the scope of the cause of action I would have thought arose only when we're talking about implied causes of action, like Cummings last term, for example.

And what we're saying is that whether a right is secured by law depends, among other things, on whether or not, at the time 1983 was enacted, the -- what the common law principles were.

But I don't think that -- that, you know, it's going to help anybody just to address FNHRA in this case.

Snyder", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For half a century, this Court has recognized that Section 1983 means what it says, providing an express cause of action that by default applies to rights created by any federal statute. Petitioners provide no sound basis for revisiting that precedent. First, they offer no evidence that the Congress that enacted Section 1983 would have viewed breach-of-contract suits by third parties as remotely relevant to the new tort it was creating. Second, Petitioners can't show that their rule was the sort of well-settled background principle that Congress incorporates into a statute silently. And, finally, Congress has affirmatively confirmed that some rights created in the Social Security Act are enforceable through Section 1983.   Disregarding that ratification would unsettle decades of legitimate legislative reliance. This Court should accordingly reaffirm the framework that it applied in Gonzaga and Blessing.   Applying that framework here, however, we agree that Congress displaced Section 1983 in FNHRA, and we therefore ask the Court to reverse on that basis alone. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So you think -- the same question I posed to Mr. Robbins.   In terms of looking to see if there's a comprehensive remedy, do administrative remedies provided by the Secretary count? "}, {"speaker": "Benjamin W. Snyder", "text": " So I think we would articulate the standard, frankly, much like Justice Kagan did.   We think that they can count in some circumstances.   We certainly don't think that they count in all circumstances. This Court has said that ordinarily a state administrative remedy is not sufficient to displace Section 1983.   But, for two reasons, we think that the -- the remedy that Congress created here is -- is sufficient to displace 1983. The first is that it is an extensive system of remedies that include enforcement mechanisms by the Secretary himself.   So the states administer FNHRA in the sense that they provide surveyors who go -- go out to each facility each year to make sure that the -- the facilities are in compliance with FNHRA. But there is also an additional process by which the Secretary can impose sanctions on each facility.   They can impose civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day per violation.   They can cut off further Medicaid funding at the facility.   They can require the installation of new management at the facility. And they can even order the facility to close. So we think those administrative mechanisms by the Secretary are significant. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I understand how you -- how administrative remedies that lessen the burden on the -- on the -- on the recipient, the states, certainly could be taken into account. But, if the requirement is that the states know unambiguously what they're agreeing to, how can administrative remedies that expand their liability be taken into account? "}, {"speaker": "Benjamin W. Snyder", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Taken into account the other way. "}, {"speaker": "Benjamin W. Snyder", "text": " So, Mr. Chief Justice, when this Court has talked about the unambiguous requirements in its -- its 1983 cases, it's really focused on whether the right was set out unambiguously in the statute.   The Court hasn't talked about that unambiguous requirement in the second part of the Gonzaga inquiry.   So I think that's a partial answer. The other thing I would say is that these administrative enforcement mechanisms are laid out in the statute.   Now they're elaborated on in regulations, but the statute itself provides for all of the enforcement mechanisms that I just described, and so the state knows about those. I -- I -- I don't -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I mean, one of them is that voice grievances.   I mean, that certainly doesn't set out in the statute any -- any awareness of what type of remedies are going to be provided in that situation. "}, {"speaker": "Benjamin W. Snyder", "text": " No, that's true.   And so the -- the remedies that I described are not remedies for grievances.   Grievances tend to be resolved at the facility level, or a nursing home resident can also file grievances with the state long-term care ombudsman, who can help to bring about an amicable resolution of those problems. The remedies that I was describing come either from complaints, which are more formal filings with the state survey commission or State Survey Agency or through notice to HHS, which can then send out a federal survey team if it -- if it deems that appropriate to impose those remedies.

We think that ordinarily -- Justice Kagan, you were getting at this -- ordinarily, when you have a system in which all of the regulated parties are state actors, and Congress creates an administrative enforcement mechanism, it would be unclear whether Congress intended that administrative mechanism to be exclusive or if, instead, Congress just assumed that Section 1983 would provide a background default rule that would also allow private suits. What's different about this case is that Congress was acting in an area where a substantial number of the participants are private parties, and Congress contemplated providing a private cause of action against those private parties but left that out of the ultimate bill it enacted. And so we know that Congress believed that the administrative enforcement mechanism it was creating was sufficient for the 90 percent of nursing home residents who -- who live in privately operated -- operated facilities, and we think that's a very strong indication that it -- it didn't believe that a private cause of action -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

In each of those three cases, there was a private judicial remedy. Now, in cases where this Court has found that Section 1983 was not displaced, the Court has emphasized the lack of either a judicial or an administrative mechanism. And so we think the fact that the Court has asked about the availability of an administrative mechanism suggests that in some cases that could be sufficient, and we think that it's sufficient here.

The -- the thing that we are getting at is whether Congress would have assumed that Section 1983 was providing a -- a backstop in most of the cases. And, here, Congress wouldn't have done that because Congress knew that for a significant number of the cases where it was creating rights, there would be no private cause of action.   And so it must have concluded that the administrative mechanism it was establishing in FNHRA itself was comprehensive and sufficient at the federal level to protect those rights. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But why? In Indiana -- we have an amicus that tells us that Indiana, the majority of nursing homes are state-owned and that in Pennsylvania -- immunizes government officials from any recovery whatsoever.

And I take it at its word. And, secondly, those other remedies have benefits that are independent from the privately owned. "}, {"speaker": "Benjamin W. Snyder", "text": " So a couple of things on that.   One is that within the administrative enforcement mechanism that Congress created, it did address this concern about sort of -- I -- I think the negative characterization would be the state regulating state entities.   And in that context, Congress said that the Secretary would have responsibility for certifying state facilities and gave the Secretary the ability to impose enforcement remedies at state-operated facilities.   So we think that Congress accounted for it in that way. You mentioned that Congress said expressly no in the statute, and I think you were referring to (h)(8), so I wanted to wanted to address that provision.   We -- we understand that provision to operate in the same way as the provisions that this Court addressed in Sea Clammers and Rancho Palos Verdes.   Congress, in that provision, was attempting to ensure that rights that -- that residents already had independently of FNHRA would not somehow be eliminated through the adoption of FNHRA. It spoke specifically to -- sorry. I'm looking at the language.   The -- it shouldn't be construed as limiting -- sorry -- that the remedies it was creating were in addition to those otherwise available under state or federal law. We think that that \"otherwise available\" means rights that -- rights and remedies that the residents would have had without the adoption of FNHRA.   We don't think that was speaking one way or the other to whether Congress intended for FNHRA to allow residents to bring new Section 1983 suits they hadn't been able to bring before. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It seems to me that if Congress was explicitly looking to state regulation that it would want a cause of action that already existed to apply.   By mentioning the state and the obligation for the federal government to step in and regulate it more, one would think then that 1983 would have a greater attraction there. "}, {"speaker": "Benjamin W. Snyder", "text": " So, Justice Sotomayor, we -- we just draw a difference in -- a different inference from the way Congress structured the statute.   We also think, to -- to get to the point of the tension between the administrative enforcement mechanism that Congress created and Section 1983 remedies, that Congress specifically directed the ways in which money collected through civil penalties are be -- are to be spent, for example, and focused that on the -- the welfare of residents more broadly, as opposed to just going to an individual resident whose rights had been wronged. And so allowing Section 1983 suits that would sort of bypass that administrative enforcement mechanism and lead to funds being taken out of the nursing home system would be inconsistent with that congressional choice. I do want to take a moment -- I haven't gotten any questions on the first question presented, but I do want to bring up the 1994 statutes, which, to the extent that there is any doubt about whether Thiboutot was correctly decided, we think that the two legislative ratifications that Congress adopted in 1994 put that to rest.   In those statutes, Congress wrote that \"in an action brought to enforce a provision of the Social Security Act, such provision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of the Act requiring a state plan.\" I don't think there's any way to read that legislative text other than as embracing a -- a congressional expectation that at least some of the provisions of the Social Security Act would be enforceable under Section 1983. My friend's approach on the first question presented would say that no provisions of the Social Security Act can ever be enforced under Section 1983.   We think that was wrong as an original matter, but we also don't think that it can be reconciled with those 1994 statutes. With that, I'm happy to rest on our brief. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Tutt", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The difference between our position and the United States's position in this case is unbelievably narrow.   The United States agrees that this Court should not overrule decades of precedent holding that rights secured by Spending Clause laws are enforceable under Section 1983.   And the United States agrees that FNHRA creates two enforceable rights.   And we are obviously right about those points. The only point of departure is that the United States believes that Congress showed a clear intention to preclude access to 1983 by extending FNHRA rights to residents of private nursing homes, even though they're not able to use 1983 to enforce those rights because 1983 only permits suits against government actors. That gets the statute backwards. FNHRA's text and context show that when Congress enacted the statute in 1987, it wanted to preserve access to all available remedies for FNHRA violations to the greatest extent possible. Thus, as no one disputes, Congress expressly preserved the ability of nursing home residents to sue to enforce their FNHRA rights in private lawsuits under state tort law.   And, as the United States concedes, Congress expressly preserved the ability of the Attorney General to enforce these rights under CRIPA, which is just Section 1983 for the Attorney General. We think it is equally clear that Congress wanted to preserve access to Section 1983 for two reasons.   First, the statute says it.   The statute's Savings Clause, on Joint Appendix 123, means what it says.   The Savings Clause says that other remedies will also be available to enforce FNHRA.   The legislative history confirms that that is the correct reading of the text. Second, Congress had good reason to preserve 1983 specifically for residents of government nursing homes.   Congress knew that sovereign immunity often makes it more difficult or impossible to sue government nursing homes. Congress also understood that when states own the nursing homes, FNHRA's scheme, which depends on states to enforce FNHRA's requirements, falls apart. And Congress enacted FNHRA against a background of numerous laws, like CRIPA, RLUIPA, RFRA, and Section 1983 itself, that specifically hold governments to a higher standard to protect rights than private institutions. Finally, I would also like to reiterate that, even aside from all of the above, the actual standard in this Court's cases for finding implied preclusion is exceptionally high.   It requires incompatibility between the remedies in the statute and Section 1983.   There is no incompatibility here. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " You -- you said -- you -- you quoted the provision referenced in the Joint Appendix about other remedies.   Mr. Robbins told us that the \"other\" means other than the particular statute at issue.   What -- what is your response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew T. Tutt", "text": " I don't think it makes sense grammatically.   It says \"the remedies provided under this subsection shall be in addition to those otherwise available under\" -- \"under state and federal law. \"And so it's talking about the remedies in the statute that are for FNHRA violations.   So these are taking funds away or they're actual remedies as the word \"remedy\" is used.   It's not a -- it's not a sort of term of art. If you compare that with the Savings Clause in Sea Clammers, it said the right to pursue other relief.   And the Court found that provision ambiguous, then looked to the legislative history.

The -- well, it had -- the way it's structured grammatically, it actually says the right to pursue other relief, and so under other statutes. So it's that the -- when the Congress used that in the Savings Clause, the Court deemed that provision ambiguous.   But the statute also had strong indicia of true incompatibility with 1983. It had citizens suit provisions that limited the available relief under federal law. So, if you brought -- if you made 1983 available, that Savings Clause was going to be doing a lot of work in the Sea Clammers case because it was going to be basically eliminating the private citizens suit provision.   There was a true incompatibility because people would always use 1983. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " That's a respect in which you depart from the Solicitor General?

But I understood that Congress has a scheme now for allowing -- for requiring states to have plans that allow individual residents who have rights that they feel are being denied to have hearings, to have appeals, to cause the investigation of complaints.

So Pennsylvania actually has had it clearly the law that FNHRA is enforceable under 1983 for 10 years. There have been a total of 44 lawsuits over those 10 years.   So you're looking at four to five lawsuits per year.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But I'm not sure that's an answer.   You're just saying people don't use 1983.

I'm saying they don't use it in lieu of the administrative remedies because the administrative remedies are supposed to be lightweight, easy to use, fast remedies that ultimately restore the status quo.   That's the nature of many of the remedies in tension. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But I guess the question is, why isn't that what Congress intended rather than giving people the -- the opportunity to get damages? And I'm looking at the administrative remedies and I see that in some sections of them there are even civil penalties that can be extracted in the context of administration, and Congress doesn't say that money that you get goes to the victims of, you know, nursing home failures and -- and neglect, so it didn't seem as though Congress really was focused on making sure that individuals in the context of these nursing homes were getting paid or getting money in compensation. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew T. Tutt", "text": " Your Honor, I want to emphasize how the Savings Clause fits into this argument, because I think, even if you don't think it's an independent basis for ruling for us and gets us all the way there, it -- it tells us what Congress's intent was on this very question because it preserved state tort actions, state private damages actions for individuals against nursing homes that violate these rights. And this is in the actual legislative history even more clearly than in the text of the statute.   So it confirms the text. So that's -- that's how I understand. If they are -- if they are still permitting people to enforce these rights in private damages suits, just under state law, then why would they not also want to make available the remedy that very clearly applies in this exact situation, which is a remedy that permits you to sue for the deprivation of any rights secured by the laws? "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " And you don't think the answer is found in the fact that there's just -- you know, if they allow this federal right to go forward, it's really not going to be something that all of the people can avail themselves of or all of the people in nursing homes because of the idea that only a few of them are state-run? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew T. Tutt", "text": " Your Honor, we don't know, for instance, whether, even though 10 percent of nursing homes were public, whether the worst nursing homes were those 10 percent. We don't know anything about what Congress knew, in fact, about the state of play in the nursing home industry.   We don't know if Congress expected that in 10 years' time it would be flipped around and would be 10 percent private and 90 percent public. And it actually cashes out in this case because Indiana has made more than 90 percent of its nursing homes public.   So it is the exact flip reverse of the rest of the nation. And for the individuals in those nursing homes who confront very draconian limitations on their ability to actually enforce these rights under state law, against state-run nursing facilities, it is really Section 1983 that is filling the gap and making those rights real for those people. Congress doesn't create rights with the expectation that, generally, with the expectation that someone else will come in and enforce those rights on your behalf. The way that the Solicitor General thinks this scheme should work and -- and HHC is that you are given rights.   You are told of these rights orally and in writing on admission to the nursing home.   They say you have the right to be free from restraints.   And your family reads this and then, if you -- you don't actually have any rights to enforce.

So -- so the way I understand private remedies is it really means federal judicial remedies.   And that makes sense in the broader context of statutory interpretation, which is this Court doesn't want to get into the business of trying to mind read Congress about what did it know about the nursing home industry -- when it's not evident from the face of the statute -- what did it know about the policy considerations of should people in the public nursing homes have -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

The -- the -- the nursing home is required to then inform the state regulator, and then maybe the state regulator will take action. In this very case, HHC continues to say that -- that we got all the relief that we were seeking.   We got none of the relief that we were seeking.   We didn't even -- we didn't even use any kind of grievance process.   A private neurologist had to be hired to taper the drugs.

So, I mean, this family was crying out for help and using every possible lever at their disposal.   Section 1983 was the last resort.   They went to seven medical malpractice attorneys and were turned away because the claim wasn't worth enough money in Indiana.   It -- this is -- this is a life-saver for people who cannot actually make effective use of the administrative scheme, and that is how 1983 functions, and it is, as we understand it, how it has functioned in Pennsylvania. So, empirically, these suits are brought actually mostly as injunctive actions to remedy systemic, egregious policies of actually violating the federal rights in FNHRA.

Instead, a private neurologist was hired and worked with the nursing home to have the -- the drugs removed. With respect to the transfer, they won the administrative proceeding -- proceeding, and the nursing home still refused his readmission. And they pleaded with the state regulator -- and perhaps HHC can address this on rebuttal -- but it -- they were told you need to go to a state court and sue for a state injunction to force the nursing home to actually take action on the administrative order from the ALJ that you just won.   So that was the -- that was how this actually played out in practice. And, of course, in the Anderson case in the Ninth Circuit, this was so -- this was considered to be such a systematic problem in the state of California that a suit was actually brought against the State of California to order the State of California to actually force the ALJ orders to be presumptively enforceable because nursing homes would be told under the state-level administrative process that they needed to take someone back and then they wouldn't. And it is very difficult to think of this as a comprehensive remedial scheme when the remedy for being involuntarily evicted from your home by a nursing home is to go back to that place where you fear retaliation potentially, where if -- if you were involuntarily transferred in, for instance, the context of this case because you were being abused, you don't want to go back.

And the Court has never drawn this line that somehow, if the right also runs against a private actor, it's a second-class right, even when you're in a public facility. I mean, in the -- for any person who goes to a public nursing home, they don't go and research sort of whether or not the private nursing homes also have a bill of rights.   And so they read that bill of rights on a public nursing home's walls and they think: I've got these rights.   And, usually, when you have rights against the government, you think I must have some kind of remedy.   That -- that's one answer. The other answer I want to give is it's just an incredibly unadministrable test that they're asking the Court to adopt, which would require, again, the Court to weigh policy considerations that it doesn't undertake in ordinary statutory interpretation analysis. The Court actually has rules of statutory interpretation that resolve cases like this about implied repeal or implied preclusion. And those -- those are typically the way that the Court addresses this kind of situation because it doesn't want to get into empirical judgments about who is abusing -- you know, who is the worst actor, who -- who are these rights actually being created to protect, et cetera.

But Spending Clause legislation doesn't confer a right in and of itself.   It's dependent on the recipient of the money agreeing.

You know, Justice Scalia in Blessing talked about the fact that new rights created in new statutes would still be presumptively enforceable under Section 1983.   No one would dispute that.   And we take the statute for what the words meant at the time, not necessarily for the scope of rights that would be protected. But, even if you disagree with all of that, these are actually the kinds of rights that Section 1983 was enacted to protect, rights to bodily integrity and autonomy, fundamental rights, you know, if you map this onto the rights protected by the Constitution. So, if you're asking if this kind of tort would be the kind of right that you could enforce, I think the answer is an emphatic yes. If you're -- if you're asking about contract law, I don't think that the contract law analogy makes sense for numerous reasons.   Most obviously, Spending Clause legislation like this didn't exist, and the -- and the kind of analogy to Spending Clause legislation didn't emerge until the 20th Century.

"}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " If you don't use the contract analysis -- analogy, all these Spending Clause cases have been defended on that basis, so you would have to now create a new theory. That was a basis for saying they were constitutional.   If you eliminate that, what does that leave you with? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew T. Tutt", "text": " Well, Your Honor, we -- we don't -- I think there's two steps to the question that you're asking me.   The first is, if we don't use the Spending Clause -- the contract analogy, what test would we use to understand the constitutionality of Spending Clause legislation? But we don't actually dispute the -- the contract analogy for purposes of the constitutionality of these kinds of laws. We don't say that -- that this isn't the kind of law that the state has to enter into, the agreement, knowingly and voluntarily and have clear notice -- we -- and unambiguous notice.   We don't disagree with any of those things, which are, we think, the things that are key to the constitutionality of Spending Clause legislation. The HHC wants to take that analogy one step further and say that the Congress that enacted 1983 must have thought that that analogy that hadn't yet even really been explored by this Court would further extend to how 1983 would be interpreted.   And we don't -- we don't see -- I hope I'm being responsive. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, I think the problem is that it's one thing to have the contract analogy as a basis.   And then, as you play it out, you say: Well, if you -- if you continue that, you say, well, who is this contract between? And that's been the basis. It's the state is receiving the money, for example, under these conditions, so the national government can require them to do certain things.   Then the next step would be: Does it also give a right to a third-party beneficiary to vindicate some of those rights? That's the way we have done it.   Now you're saying it's okay to have the contract analogy at the formation stage, but you can drop it along the way if it becomes inconvenient on the back end, that is, on the rights vindication stage -- at the rights vindication stage. So I don't know if we've ever done that, and I don't know if you can -- you can do that and still have the constitutional justification for it. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew T. Tutt", "text": " Well, Your -- Your Honor, I would just go back to Pennhurst, which really started this -- this off, and it applied the contract analogy but said that the rights are part of the contract.   So, to the degree that you have individuals who are suing, it's because Section 1983 is part of the contract. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Okay.   I agree.   But is the beneficiary here a party to that contract? That's -- that's the rub. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew T. Tutt", "text": " Your Honor -- Your Honor, we -- we don't dispute that the -- the -- that Mr. Talevski was the beneficiary of this contract.   We don't -- we don't dispute that if you -- if you want to think of it that way, but it's not material for purposes of the -- the analysis because Section 1983 says that he has the right to sue and the state promised that he would have the right to sue by entering into the agreement with the federal government to take.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito? Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Barrett? "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Just really quickly, wouldn't we have to believe that how the right came into being mattered to Congress? I mean, in response to both Justices Thomas and Alito, in order to get to the position of saying Spending Clause legislation is sort of carved out of 1983 because it confers these sort of conditional rights and doesn't confer them directly, doesn't that reduce to saying: We understand that how a right came into being mattered to Congress in order to reach that result? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew T. Tutt", "text": " I think that -- I think that that would be one way to understand the -- the question and that -- that we don't -- we don't think that it did matter to Congress because there's nothing in the text of Section 1983 that -- that could be read to sort of care about the provenance of the rights you're trying to assert. Thank you, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Robbins, rebuttal? "}, {"speaker": "Lawrence S. Robbins", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- I'd like to open with Justice Thomas's question to Mr. Tutt just a moment ago. What is unique about the Spending Clause is that it allows Congress to do things it could not otherwise constitutionally do. I submit that, obviously, this question is not presented today but that the micromanaging of nursing care facilities in Marion, Indiana, is not something which Congress could have done under its Commerce Clause authority or under its Section 5 Fourteenth Amendment authority.   The reason it can do these things is because the state has consented to it. So the question of consent is crucial to the constitutionality of the statute itself, and that entails certain common law principles. You don't -- the -- the -- the 1871 Congress did not have to imagine that Pennhurst would someday come down. It's not as if Spending Clause statutes only became contractual by nature because the Court in 1981 in Pennhurst said that it was.   It was always -- those statutes were always contractual in nature.   And it therefore bears critically on the marriage of 1983 and FNHRA that we ask the question: What did 1983 mean when it was enacted? And the answer to that question is that the common law, generally speaking, prohibited individuals from bringing third-party beneficiary claims on government contract cases. By the way -- and this goes back, Justice Sotomayor's question, that you asked me -- you said, well, what about these legal history professors who say the law was different? I contend that they've misread the law by, as I say, gerrymandering the denominator, but, even if it were as murky as the law professors suggest that it was, the burden is not on us, I suggest, to show that the law was clear on our side. The burden is on the plaintiff, who's asking that a certain right be created and enforced to show that it was settled in their direction.   You have not heard any argument this morning that even remotely suggests that that's true. Now how about ratification? That is a red herring if there ever was one.   The language in the statute that overruled Suter, this Court's Suter decision, made, I thought, painfully clear that it was doing very little. All it said was we are -- we no longer will tolerate -- we no longer will -- you may no longer claim that a right is unenforceable because it is embedded in a provision that requires a state plan. But the statute goes on to say that all other arguments are preserved.   It doesn't expand or decrease any other basis for saying that a right is unenforceable.   And what's more, it preserves even the outcome in the decision in Suter. I see that my red light is on, and I appreciate the Court's indulgence. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
