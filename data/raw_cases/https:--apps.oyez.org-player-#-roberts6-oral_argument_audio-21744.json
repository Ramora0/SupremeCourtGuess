[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will now hear argument next this morning in case 137 on our original docket, Montana v. Wyoming and North Dakota.   General Bullock. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   The Tongue and Powder Rivers are the only significant water supply in a 10,000 square mile area in Montana and Wyoming, and this Court is being asked to decide whether the compact allows Wyoming to take the return flows that Montana farmers in that area have always relied on or, instead, affords protection to both States.   Our exception should be sustained for three reasons.   First, the plain language of the compact preserves the water supply each State was receiving as of 1950.   Second, contrary to the compact's purposes, the master's interpretation would allow individual water users to alter those amounts.   And third, the master's policy determinations about efficiency add ambiguity to the principles underlying a century of western water law.   On that-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " General Bullock, would you please point to the precise language of the compact that freezes consumption, as distinguished from the amount of water diverted, which freezes consumption as of January 1st, 1950? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --Yes, Your Honor.   In the compact it's at the appendix of the master's first interim report.   Two areas: first, the preamble provides for an equitable division/apportionment of the water; and then the operative provision, article V(A), states that the uses existing as of January 1st, 1950, in each signatory State shall continue to be enjoyed. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, the uses existing is irrigation. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Um-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I don't see where it says, and so I can understand, the amount of water diverted can't be increased. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --Your Honor, the whole of Article V(A) and V(B) -- I mean, no one contests that it's a full allocation of the water.   So V(B) is water after 1950.   V(A) is prior.   And in order for the status quo to be -- remain -- for the appropriative rights to beneficial uses existing in Montana as of 1950, there needs to be a water supply.   And also operative to that, it's within the definitions at article II(A) to the beneficial use.   And that's a derivation or departure from the general prior appropriation law, because it's that use by which a water supply is depleted when-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But why doesn't the language in Article V(A) -- and this is not too helpful -- simply restate the issue before us, what is a beneficial use by the upstream owner? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, it need not because in article II(H) it defines what a beneficial use is, and that's that use by which the water supply of a basin is depleted.   And it's that depletion that -- as of 1950, so it wasn't a full consumption of water in Wyoming, and that depletion is the return flow upon which Montanans rely. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's the essence of the argument before us.   The depletion was the amount of water that was taken from this water source to irrigate the crops.   The -- the issue now before us is whether beneficial use means consumption or it means use, isn't it?   I -- you're begging the question in my mind, because I don't -- what source do you have for the fact that a return flow is beneficial use? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Your Honor, the return flow is the basis of Montana's water right, so that the return flow under the compact isn't actually beneficial use. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's not actually true.   Their water right was the beneficial use that your pre-1950 consumers used, meaning you had consumers who were irrigating their own crops who were doing other things with the water.   The rights protected are their pre-1950 uses.   You're putting -- you're -- you're still equating consumption as -- as being their use, but I don't know where you get that equation from. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " The equation, Your Honor, that consumption is the same thing as-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " As use. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --as use? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Well, we could go actually to the special master, who himself had stated that when exploring -- I mean, the beneficial use reflects the historic consumptive use.   It's from his own textbook.   It's on page 82.   The Master says that a senior's right is limited to the amount he originally beneficially applied and consumptively used; that is, the amount received at the point of use minus the runoff. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could someone pre-1950 who irrigated crops change the crops? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " It's -- it's an open question, Your Honor.   Yes, they certainly could, but not if it impacted a downstream appropriator, as per this compact. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How in the world do any States monitor that?   The change in crops, the change in irrigation methods, the change in anything that would cause a difference in return flow?   Let's assume global warming in some form or another evaporated more water, and so some crop area did some solar heating that caused a greater evaporation.   Is that a breach of the compact?   So two questions embedded in there.   How does any State monitor that, the change in crops or change in irrigation methods?   And, second, how far does it go in terms of the pre-1950s right to use their water? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " To the first question, Your Honor, even as of 1950, the drafters recognized that this was a fully appropriated river; it had reached its maximum practical limit.   So each individual downstream knows how much water they should be getting.   I mean, we have 80 years of measurements on one of these rivers alone, and you could go online right now and find out what the flow is at the State line occurring as of this morning.   So a piece of it that this is something we have been doing for a long time in the West as far as knowing what water is in the river, where it is, and throughout, you know, downstream appropriation.   To the second question-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But all that shows is -- or might show in a particular case, is that the amount of water is reduced.   Now -- then the question is have the senior appropriators or the upstream appropriators reduced it in a way that's inconsistent or that's an overuse of their beneficial rights, and you're right -- again right where we started from.   And then you have to regulate exactly how each irrigator is using the appropriative rights. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --And, Your Honor, you don't-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " So the -- so the flows don't necessarily answer the question. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --Well, Your Honor, it's ultimately up to each State to administer their rights and their water intrastate.   But this is a compact among sovereigns.   So what we need, what Montana needs, is to get that supply of water that it was receiving as of 1950. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But if you've -- we've been talking about beneficial uses.   What the compact said -- says is, appropriative rights to beneficial uses.   And to me that suggests, which I always understood to be the way water law worked in the West, is you have a right to pull out water, and the appropriative right is you have the right to take out however much you were taking out, and the fact that less comes back, that's something different.   That doesn't affect your appropriation. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Your Honor, even at the time of the compact, Wyoming recognized their paper rights, that appropriative right, was much more than the actual use occurring.   So you can't read beneficial use out of -- especially under this compact, but in any.   Even under the general common law, you only have an appropriative right for the beneficial use, and all along-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, isn't that what's going on here?   The beneficial use is the irrigation of crops.   They have an appropriative right to take out so much flow for that.   That's all they're doing.   They're doing it now, just as they were back then.   They just use up more of it once they've taken it out. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --Mr. Chief Justice, two things, the first of which, the beneficial use is -- I mean, we can't read this definition of beneficial use out of the contract or out of the compact -- and it is a contract, actually, among States.   And also, though -- second of which, though, that it's also a fundamental tenet of prior appropriation law is the downstream irrigator takes, given the same conditions as when he first got his or her right. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Given the same conditions.   But is there any evidence, or can you say anything from the record or any other place, going back to 1950 -- I assume in 1950 people knew how much the different landowners were taking out of the stream of the river in Wyoming to use for irrigation and other such purposes.   They knew that.   Is there any indication they knew at that time how much each individual landowner was putting back?   I think the answer is no.   But I would be very interested if it's yes.   And I think it would help you a lot if it's yes, because I'm -- to tell you the truth, I'm pretty skeptical of the fact that they're writing an appropriation right into this about regulating something they don't even know about. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Effectively, Your Honor, it could be yes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, I didn't say it could be yes.   I would like you to tell me if the answer is yes, and then of course I'm going to ask you where in the record I find something that says that they knew how much each individual landowner is putting back into this river in Wyoming.   And I think you can't answer that question, can you? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " I certainly can't answer that, and they didn't need to know, from the perspective-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Oh, they didn't?   In other words, they didn't know how much is coming back, but you're coming in and saying what they were -- what they were regulating here is they're saying, not only you get -- you maintain a right to take out 100,000 units to do your irrigation, but you have to put back 80,000, but they didn't even know what the number was, whether it was 80, 70, or 60, and the appropriation law is ambiguous?   I think -- I think I can go that far with you to say it's ambiguous, but I don't see how I can go further.   I mean, that's my basic question.   Did you see what it was?   Was I clear?   I'm saying, how can you read this treaty to require landowners to put back amounts into the river that they didn't even know what they were? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --First, Your Honor, the individual landowner does not have to put water back in that they didn't even know what they were.   What they do need to do is make sure that the beneficial -- the appropriative rights to beneficial uses existing in both States.   The Solicitor General pointed out that we don't break up V A A and V(B) and put one group priority over the other, but existing as of 1950 in both States shall continue to be enjoyed.   So the only way that we can continue to enjoy the rights in Montana downstream is to ensure that we have the water supplies that we had-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So you say you get the same amount of water and it's up to -- it's up to Wyoming to figure out who they have to cut down for not putting back enough to meet that amount?   You don't care what private owner it comes from?   It's up to Wyoming to figure out who has to be cut back? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --Your Honor, I don't say we-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I'm trying to help you. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --Sorry? "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes, I think that is what -- the answer is yes, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Yes, but -- but, Your Honor, we don't say the exact same quantity of water.   We say under like water supplies. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Under like water supplies, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Yes.   Could you tell me the -- I didn't get the page of the special master's report which you asserted adopts your -- your definition of beneficial use.   What page was it? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I thought you referred us, just while you're going through your notes, to page 82, and there's an intriguing footnote where the special master talks about his own -- his own book.   But that doesn't seem to me to be conclusive on your point, because he's saying the area is confused.   And his point it seems he brings up what the special -- I'm taking over your answer to Justice Scalia's question.   It is page 282. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Footnote 15, yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " The footnote on that page, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " And there he's talking about-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " It seems to say what you say it says. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If your understanding is correct, would the result be that landowners in Wyoming would only be allowed to consume as much as they consumed in 1950, but landowners in Montana could take advantage of improved irrigation techniques and use much more of the -- they could divert the same amount of water, but they could use much more of it? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --No, Your Honor, that would not be the case. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why wouldn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " First, for the irrigators in Montana -- I mean, one of the things -- Montana sought to have a system of interstate administration.   Montana -- or Wyoming, through storage, through curtailing consumption by post-'50 users, or otherwise can administer its water rights in however it so deems.   So ultimately, that's a decision of the State of how it administers the water rights and the consumption of that amount that it has.   For Montana, we can't increase consumption any more than the water that we would have received at that point.   So to the extent that Montana allows an individual irrigator to go to 100 percent of consumption of its water right, then in our system in Montana, we have to deal with what's going to happen to the subsequent appropriator right downstream. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And what happens under Montana law? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Under Montana law, if there's an injury, and that's -- that's actually -- and the special master pointed this out in another one of his footnotes, that that still would be actionable.   Like a change from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation, to the extent that it deprives a downstream user of waters that they're relying on, that they could bring an action. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes, but your people can do that.   Your people can get more use out of the same amount of water diverted by going to sprinkler irrigation, whereas the people in Wyoming can't.   That's a little unfair, it seems to me.   Right? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Both can, Your Honor.   That -- that is -- I guess that presumption is that we would have the water to use it, and Wyoming is actually getting a lot more production by consuming a lot more of the water within its right. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Your people are entitled to take out the same amount they took out before, right?   Pre-1950? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Under like water supply conditions. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Whereas the people in Wyoming, you say, are not entitled to take out the same amount; they are entitled only net the same amount that they had before.   Whereas downstream your people can take out the same amount and whereas before 20 percent of it used to go back into the stream, they can now make use of that whole 20 percent through sprinkler irrigation, right?   It gives you a great advantage.   I mean, maybe that's the way it was written, but -- but don't tell me that this is even-handed, because I don't-- "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Your Honor, I don't think that it does give us a great advantage, because we still have to deal with the same amount of water supply that we would have had.   So at that point, if we switch to sprinkler irrigation, the first irrigator does that, there's going to be a shortage downriver unless we make it up through additional storage or other causes.   So-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Do you have ultimate liability to Montana -- pardon me, to North Dakota for overuse? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --We do a little bit, Your Honor.   There's the picture of the basin in the first appendix. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, I won't -- I won't get into that, but it does seem to me that the Chief Justice asked the question, if you're entitled to take the water, you can use it for any purpose.   I -- I -- I take it the answer to that is it has to be a beneficial use, it has to be for approximately the same crop, but that brings us to this -- to this gray area that the special master refers to on page 82 as confusing.   And I think, was it page 65 he talks about this is a confusing area of the law?   What is your best authority for your position?   What is the -- do you have a case or a -- a -- a paragraph in a treatise that's-- "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Sure.   Yes, Your Honor.   In 1992 the Utah Supreme Court framed the question: This court's called upon to determine the applicable law when the use of new technology-- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " --The Utah case is your best case? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --That's -- that's the only case that any of the parties cited that actually deals with the change from sprinkler -- or flood to sprinkler irrigation.   And what that said is if the return flow goes to the same river which it came from, that subsequent irrigators or downstream appropriators have the right to rely on that.   And I guess I would say that my second best case is the special master's own footnote.   It's 6912, where he says that, you know, even though State change procedures don't typically apply to crop or -- changes in crop irrigation techniques, this does not mean there's no way to challenge increases in efficiency.   Downstream water users, for example, could sue to enjoin an upstream appropriator from increasing consumption or to force the upstream appropriator to replace lost runoff. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " --I would think your best point is not all of that stuff, but simply the definition section, which very clearly makes a distinction between beneficial use and diversion.   And your point is that what is guaranteed is not the diversion right that existed pre-1950, but the beneficial use right, which is the net use of the water, not -- not the total amount diverted.   If -- if there were not both of those definitions, it seems to me it would be a little -- your case would be a little harder.   But with the two of those definitions there and with V(A) using beneficial use rather than -- it could have said diversion, appropriative right to diversion, but it didn't say that.   It said to beneficial use.   Well, why -- why define beneficial use that way if you don't mean it?   That's your best point, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " I -- I -- I agree, Your Honor.   [Laughter]   I was trying to -- I believe Justice Kennedy asked for a case or a treatise, so that's-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Well, all right. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --But I agree that the plain language -- and especially in an area where there's so much ambiguities the special master acknowledges, why change the status quo of what was occurring?   And that's-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I don't understand why that's a good -- good answer.   I mean, the beneficial use is that use by which the water supply is depleted.   Well, the use here is irrigation.   It doesn't say irrigation up to the technological development in 1950.   They're still taking out the same amount of water for that beneficial use.   They're using it to irrigate.   And if they get better at it so they use more, well, that's just too bad for you. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --Your Honor, but they're depleting more from the basin, and that's -- you can have beneficial use for non-consumptive purposes. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's back where -- that's where I was here.   See, I can't get too far.   I mean, you have the word \"depletion\" in that definition.   I -- I -- that might help you.   But I'm thinking in accordance with the doctrine of appropriation, what does that doctrine, that legal doctrine, say about use and return?   That's why we're -- we're -- why I was thinking it seems totally unclear.   It talks about seepage, the cases, which I gather is different from return.   Okay.   So could they have really meant net?   And what struck me is that they couldn't, which -- which you were beginning to address, too, is that they couldn't have meant net because the water law at that time is unlikely to have meant net for the reason that they didn't -- you don't know what's coming back.   Do you see?   It's not just -- I see your point.   Your point is, well, Wyoming knew how much was going into Wyoming.   But that's not my point.   My point is what -- what's the water law?   What's the law of appropriation at that time in respect to return flows?   And if people didn't measure return flows in general, I suspect in an ambiguous area they would have analogized it to seepage, which is what the -- what the special master thought. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Your Honor, the seepage cases, though, deal with adjoining landowners-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yes, they-- "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " --not the same river flow, and the special master acknowledged that. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " --Uh-huh. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " That -- and I guess what I was earlier trying to explain is certainly each appropriator knows how much water it would -- would be receiving, what the flows typically are, and they all basically judge on it.   But I guess if there is any ambiguity -- and the law wasn't necessarily clear as of 1950 on conversions from flood to sprinkler irrigation, but what we were trying to do is preserve those uses in both States existing as of January 1st, 1950, and we can't do that without a water supply.   Other than the text, I think that the next place that one would look in interpreting the compact would be the legislative history.   And I think that the report to the Senate was real good in saying that -- and this is part of -- it's appended to motion -- Montana's brief in response to the motion to dismiss the bill of complaint.   At 3a it says:   \"It's clear then that the demand of one State upon another for a supply different from that now obtaining under present conditions of supply and diversion is not contemplated, nor would such a demand have a legal standing. \"   So what they were trying to do in 1950 was protect what each State was doing. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Where was that again, where at? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " That's at 3a of the appendix, Montana's motion -- or the response to Wyoming's motion to dismiss the bill of complaint. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " General, assume that you're right, that what was guaranteed was the same amount of water flowing into Montana as in 1950, and I -- I take it you don't care how Wyoming deals with this, but what -- if you're right, what could Wyoming do?   It can't tell the -- the farmers, go back to the old way of irrigating or go back to a different crop? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " No -- I mean, no, Justice Ginsburg.   Wyoming could choose to reduce groundwater pumping.   They could choose to curtail irrigation on post-1950.   They could choose to release storage.   I mean, they've -- they've built, I think, 15 new reservoirs in Wyoming since the date of the compact.   They could choose to release water from that to fulfill those rights. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " So, you say it doesn't -- they don't -- Wyoming doesn't have to know whether farmer A or farmer B is taking more than they took in 1950 -- I mean, is using more than they used in 1950; they just have to know what the total amount is, and Wyoming can make that up? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So really -- I'm sorry.   The issue is, are both of you -- both of you have pre and post-1950 users? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   And I -- I guess this goes to the second question, which was sort of not really addressed.   The special master said, well, you could cut back your post-1950 users and satisfy all of the needs of your pre-1950 users.   Why isn't that the answer?   Why isn't that an answer that should be respected, because you can satisfy all of the pre-1950 needs that you have potentially? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " No, Your Honor, we can't necessarily satisfy all the needs.   The drafters did say even as of 1950 that this basin reached its maximum practicable limit for irrigation, and that's from the October -- the last of the drafters meetings.   So -- so, the water supply as of then, without additional storage, had already hit that limit.   And ultimately what we need, though, is each State will administer intrastate, but we still should be able to rely on the ability to get a supply of water to meet those needs as of 1950 under like water supply conditions. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Before any 1950 use, post-1950 users are permitted? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " We're still at the stage of discovery, but, yes, likely that's how it would occur, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So why isn't this a premature lawsuit?   Because I think really the essence of your claim is we need the pre-1950 water flow.   We don't care who it comes from.   And what -- all the special master said, in my mind, was the difference -- you can't look to what the pre-1950s were doing in this situation, but I haven't addressed what the posts are going to do or have been doing and whether that's right, and that's depriving you of the water flow.   I don't know if he answered that question: Are you in fact entitled to a minimum amount of water flow?   That's really what should be the point of the issue, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " It is, or that quantity under like water supply conditions.   I don't think it's premature.   We have tried to administer this compact, actually made calls in 2004 and 2006; and as a result of not getting the water, knowing -- believing we're in a water-short time, that's when we filed this action.   I would like to reserve my time if I may. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Michael. "}, {"speaker": "Peter Kenneth Michael", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   This Court has identified in previous questioning, this case at this point in this issue involves whether a Wyoming or a Montana diverter may change cropping patterns, may change various technologies in irrigated agriculture, and change up and down depending on the year and the fouling of the land and that sort of thing, the amount of water that is actually consumed by crops; and I think the Court has identified the critical fact that a water right, a classic western water right, appropriate right as in article V(A), is made up of the right to divert water at a head gate in an irrigation situation, put it on a defined quantity of land and use it for a purpose, irrigation, that's defined by the State.   Wyoming has had such a -- a system in place for many years, and controls those issues but does not and has not attempted to measure consumptive. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But what is the controlling principle in answering the question that I think you properly put?   Could these irrigators switch to something like rice which absorbs a tremendous amount of water, or are they -- when they switch crops it must be reasonably close to the earlier beneficial use?   What is -- what is the standard that we look to, to answer that question? "}, {"speaker": "Peter Kenneth Michael", "text": " The standard is the standard of waste of practical irrigation.

The irrigation right is a general right, and if rice were to double the amount of consumptive use by the crop, that would be permissible if the previous use had not been affected by an abandonment action, because the amount of water was being reasonably used for the former crop and the crop has changed.

So it's not -- it's not the same -- the mill -- a mill race is not a depletion, even though some water, some water comes out because it then -- because it then comes back. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, I mean, that -- that's the key to this case, I take it.   Wyoming is telling us that what goes back is irrelevant so long as what is taken is for a recognized beneficial use? "}, {"speaker": "William M. Jay", "text": " The reason it's irrelevant, Justice Kennedy, is that -- for two reasons.   Depletion is not the measure of beneficial use.   It's a -- it is a criterion for beneficial use.   The use has to be a depletive one; but it's not the measure of the beneficial use.   And the second point, Montana seeks to equate consumption with depletion, and that's just -- that's not correct, either.   We urge the Court to overrule the exception.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Jay.   General, you have two minutes left. "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:   Briefly, as Justice Scalia pointed out this is a compact, and it's a compact between two different States, and Montana gave up things, a right of priority administration across State lines as a result of that.   Justice Breyer, as an issue of fairness, we don't get all the water.   We only get water supply under like conditions.   We are now the downstream appropriator, so -- but one example, if half the water is flowing now that it was, as of 1950, Montana may not get anything at that point, because just by the virtue of some say it's \"highology\", whoever is higher on the river gets to take first.   So we -- we don't get to fulfill our rights.   All we get is to ensure that given a like supply of water, that our rights shall continue to be enjoyed as it existed as of 1950. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How many years has there been not enough water to fill all pre-19 -- forget about whether there was post-1950 use.   How many years are we talking about in which there has been not enough water to fill everybody's? "}, {"speaker": "Steve Bullock", "text": " And -- Your Honor, we have done no discovery at all.   This is still at the motion to dismiss the complaint.   That's what the hydraulics and the engineers will ultimately determine.   We made calls in 2004 and 2006.   We said, wait a minute, we're not getting enough water here, and we believe it's the -- the pre-1950 uses that are depleting that.   Will you give us water?   Ultimately why we're here is to sort this out.   I guess, I would also point out that there was some discussion about an appropriative right is the right to use a quantity of water.   That makes sense other than if you're in a compact, and Montana gets no water.   The Solicitor General even pointed out then in his brief at a footnote; he said well, what we might do, then, is that Montana could bring an equitable apportionment action for the pre-1950 water.   That highlights the, I think to me, the illogic of just focusing on the rights and not looking at the uses and how much each State was consuming, because at that point I'll be right back here saying we want the same water under like conditions that we had in 1950.   Thank you, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, General, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
