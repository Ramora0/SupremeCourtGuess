[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 17-9560, Rehaif versus United States. Ms. Cakmis. "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To knowingly violate 922(g), one must know the crucial fact that transforms his otherwise innocent firearm possession into a 10-year felony.   That fact is his status. Applying a knowledge requirement to that fact makes sense because, ordinarily, firearm possession is lawful and, in fact, in most cases, constitutionally protected. So it only makes sense that a person should be required to know he fits within that status before his firearm possession becomes illegal. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " What do you do with this -- in this very same statute, there are crimes where the legislature has said explicitly -- well, let's take 922(g), says selling firearms to one that the defendant knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a felon, so that makes -- there's a case where the status, felon, has to be known to the defendant, but in the, what is it, 922(g), we don't have that knowing requirement. So why should we insert it when it's not there? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Because 924(a)(2) states that the person must knowingly violate 922(g). \"Knowingly\" modifies the verb \"violate\" and the direct object, \"922(g).\" Several of the provisions that are listed in 924(a)(2) do have other types of knowledge requirements, but the \"knowingly\" still forms the default or the baseline knowledge if there is not an otherwise inserted knowledge. Additionally, this Court's precedent -- and that makes sense in light of this Court's precedent, which attaches a mens rea to every element that criminalizes otherwise innocent conduct.   In fact, this Court does so even when \"knowingly\" is not in the statute. The Court reads it in. Here, Congress wasn't silent.   It put \"knowingly\" in the statute for a purpose. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Ms. Cakmis, do -- do you agree that there is no mens rea element attached to the jurisdictional element? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T.

"}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

"}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   We do infer that a mental element would attach to it if it's not simply jurisdictional, if it's not solely concerning Congress's power to legislate but has a substantive hook.

So what is the -- what reason would there be to infer that Congress wanted the mental requirement to apply to the -- the defendant's own status? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " First of all, there is the language and structure of the statute. They put \"knowingly\" directly into 922 -- 924(a)(2) in front of \"violate 922(g).\" If they had only wanted it to skip and to apply to the jurisdictional element -- excuse me -- to the possession element, they logically would have put it immediately in front of the possession element, after the nine categories of people. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What if there were no mental -- what if the statute itself made no mention of any mens rea? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Even when the statute is silent, this Court has inferred a mens rea for each substantive element, each element that relates to blameworthiness and to the -- it criminalizes otherwise innocent conduct. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So then your argument really doesn't depend on the text of the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Correct, Your Honor.   The text supports us, but, also, this Court's inferences applying a mens rea to each substantive element supports us.   Also, the purpose of FOPA in inserting \"knowingly\" in the first place, in order to ensure gun owners are not caught up in a broad net for honest or innocent mistakes. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " I thought your argument did depend on the text of the statute, but you were saying in the alternative, even if there were no mens rea element, our cases require us to still require mens rea. "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Our argument is -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Right? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " -- supported by the statute's text and structure, and we would respectfully submit the text and structure are plain, and so we don't need to go to the presumptions or legislative history. But, in the event that the Court feels it's not plain, the next step is to look at the presumptions.   And this Court's presumptions, even if \"knowingly\" is not there, is -- this Court presumes \"knowingly\" is read in. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Would this be -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I have a -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- different -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- question about the consequences of -- of your position, and the constitutional -- answer the -- to the constitutional question shouldn't turn on it, but, as a practical matter, I think I'm right that most of these possession cases are felon-in-possession cases. "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And if that's right and you prevail, then how many people who have been convicted under felon-in-possession charges could now say, well, the Supreme Court has said what has happened to me, I can't be convicted of a crime I was convicted of, so I want -- I want to get out.   I want habeas. If we say that the -- read the requirement to go to the status, as well as the conduct, the possession, then wouldn't people who have been convicted have a habeas avenue to pursue? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " There would be a habeas avenue to pursue, Your Honor.   However, habeas is not nearly as simple to navigate as a criminal proceeding.   And once you reach the land of habeas, you have cause and prejudice that have to be shown for procedural default. It's even harsher than harmless error when you get into the habeas world.   And so the number of people who might want to ask for relief might be more, but there is only a small but significant number of people out there who actually had a genuine dispute -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " -- about their knowledge of their status. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, I suppose it would get to whether or not a jury was instructed on the element of the offense that had to be -- that it had to be knowing. So it may be broader than -- than that. And, in my experience, felon-in-possession is almost always what people are charged with in -- at this level because it's the easiest thing to prove.   You can prove whether they're a felon or not and you can prove whether they had a gun.   You don't have to get into all the messy stuff about what they were up to. So I would think it would be a very, very substantial number of convictions. "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " But then there's the practical and the legal answer.   The practical answer, in all honesty, is that not that many people are going to be able to overcome all the huge procedural hurdles that are placed in front of habeas relief. And unless they had a genuine issue of fact or a genuine issue regarding their knowledge of their status, the chances of prevailing in habeas are slim to no, if that helps. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " What percentage of those guilty verdicts are by way of plea versus trial? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " There -- for a Section 922(g), approximately 95 percent are guilty pleas.   And there's no reason to believe that that's going to change significantly one way or another. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could -- could you tell me exactly what do you think the -- what are the facts he would need to know to be guilty? Because you can't have a mistake of law. "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And you can't -- and you can't be ignorant of the law.   So what are the facts the government would have to prove? That he knew his visa was conditioned -- "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- on -- on his being a student? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T.

Did I read that wrong? Did I -- "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " No, Your Honor.   In the trial court, that was another defense that was posited, that he wasn't lawfully and illegally in the country until an immigration judge had adjudged him to be so.   But that's not the issue now before the Court. It's the second aspect that the government -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So your -- the condition is that he knew he came in on a -- on a student visa that said he had to remain a student? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Yes, ma'am, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And if they show that he was told that at the time of admission and he stopped being a student, that's enough? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T.

Cakmis", "text": " In our situation, we only have one side of the story because, before trial, the government moved in limine to keep out the defense, and the court agreed with the government on the jury instruction that the jury was specifically instructed the government does not have to prove Mr. Rehaif knew his status. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That doesn't answer my question.   What could be -- otherwise be his defense? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T.

"}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " He also had a hunting license, for example, that the defense wanted to introduce into evidence.   And that's -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " But, I mean, does the evidence suggest that there was a lot of confusion about his status as a student? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " The government's evidence is all that we have because the defense didn't introduce it.   But, if the defense had been allowed to introduce the hunting license, there -- the court said there would be confusion because he didn't have to have knowledge. But a hunting license was relevant because, if he thought he was a student still, if you're on an F1 visa, you're allowed to possess a firearm anywhere at any time if you have a hunting license. So the fact that he went out and got one and then went to the firing range and shot the firearms indicated -- would have indicated or supported his defense. Additionally, he was stopped for a traffic infraction, and no one told him at that point that he had a warrant out for him or that he was illegally here, which the court kept that out of evidence because it would have caused confusion as to knowledge and as to status. But, again, it would have been relevant to his knowledge if that was allowed to be a defense. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Suppose someone who is admitted on a student visa doesn't go to school, has every reason to know, understands that he has to continue in school if -- for his visa to be valid, and he has every reason to know that he's not any longer considered to be a student by the school, hasn't been there for months and months and months, hasn't done one single thing, but doesn't actually know for sure that they have expelled him. Your position is that that person would not fall within the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Our position is that that would be a jury question. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Intent and knowledge are -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " All right.   What if the jury or the judge, whoever is the fact-finder, comes to the conclusion he didn't really know, but he had every reason to know? Is that person guilty or not guilty?

Alito, Jr.", "text": " And do you -- do you think that's really what Congress meant here? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, but I don't think that will happen in that type of a situation.   I think that -- take, for example, the dreamers, children who come into this country with their parents illegally, live here all their lives and think they're law-abiding citizens, only to find out later in adulthood that they never were law-abiding citizens. They're not citizens at all. But, if that person who had no idea he was here illegally or unlawfully possessed a gun, he would be subject to 10 years in prison under the way the case -- the law has been interpreted by the court below. We're asking the Court to apply its mens rea presumptions, as the Court has done in the past, in every case when confronted by them, and to look at the -- and to apply mens rea to the knowledge -- to the status element. That way, at least -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It does seem fairly easy for the government to prove status like you're a felon-in-possession because there's a whole series of ways you should know you're a felon, a transcript of you pleading guilty could be one of them, or a judgment of conviction, you have to be there to get that. "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Exactly.

"}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " And if the person knew the facts underlying the legal definition of \"addicted,\" they knew that they were dependent on those drugs, they knew that when they weren't taking them, they started having withdrawals or whatever the legal definition, the facts -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But how would the government be able to prove that? Meaning -- "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " In the bulk of the cases, practically speaking, it's going to be proved by the same evidence that the government uses to show the person was addicted. And in -- as in all the other statutes that require knowledge, the jury will have to infer knowledge through reasonable inferences or find that those reasonable inferences don't support the knowledge. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What about subparagraph 8, which applies to a very -- to -- to a set of individuals who are defined in a very complicated way? So there has to be a restraining order that includes a finding that the person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner or a child, and then the order by its terms must explicitly prohibit the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury. So it has to be proven that the defendant knew all of those things? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " The defendant knew the fact that he had been to court or he had been given notice of court because of a restraining order that was related to his violent conduct. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And he -- but he has to know all the -- all those characteristics of the restraining order? "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Yes, Your Honor, which would be demonstrated by the restraining order that he received a copy of in the bulk of the cases.   That hasn't been prosecuted nearly as much as, of course, the felon-in-possession, but the felon-in-possession is illustrative because it shows, if you have a judgment, for the most part, you're going to know why this judgment came about that you were facing 10 years in prison or 50 years in prison.   It's -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " If someone is charged with being a felon-in-possession, and it -- the prosecution has to prove that the person knew that this offense was a felony, can the prosecution be prohibited from -- can the defendant, by offering to stipulate, prohibit the prosecution from proving the nature of the felony? Because, if all the jury knows is that there was a conviction for a felony, then, you know, the jury doesn't know how serious this crime was.   The more serious it is, the more likely it is the person was aware of it. Normally, you can't force a party to agree to stipulate a fact that the party is entitled to prove. "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Which would make Old Chief an even stronger tool in the prosecutor's hands because the prosecutor would not have to stipulate if the defendant is challenging his knowledge of status.   He cannot force the prosecutor to stipulate because it would then become probative.   The nature of the offense would be probative to a fact, and the probative value would outweigh the prejudice. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, if that's true, then you -- you are perhaps not going to win a great victory for people charged with being a felon-in-possession.

What this Court said is that requires knowledge of the \"specific acts or omissions\" that underlie the separate regulatory offense. \"Specific acts or omissions\" is a direct quote.

"}, {"speaker": "Allon Kedem", "text": " That is.   And let me give you another example, a textual clue that Congress didn't want to require knowledge of status here. There are two instances, only two that we're aware of, where someone actually might not reasonably know or Congress might worry that they wouldn't reasonably know their own status, and Congress was explicit for both of them in its treatment. The first one is subsection (g)(8), which applies to someone who's subject to a restraining order, which you might not know because some restraining orders are issued ex parte.   And so Congress specified in (g)(8) that the restraining order has to have been issued \"after a hearing of which such person received actual notice and at which such person had an opportunity to participate.\" The other example is someone who's subject to an indictment.   One court pointed out that a lot of indictments are under seal, and so you wouldn't necessarily know that. So Congress took the indictment language, put it into its own subsection, subsection (n), and imposed a willfulness requirement. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

A person who is brought to this country by two years old by his parents, and now he's 21 years old, and they've never told him anything about being brought here when he was two years old, he's lived in Austin, Texas.   He knows that.   Now do you see? "}, {"speaker": "Allon Kedem", "text": " I understand, but by the same -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

Presumably, if Congress wanted to revolutionize the way that the -- one of the most frequently prosecuted federal crimes worked, it would have been a whole lot clearer.

If we could turn briefly to the practical consequences of this decision, the -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Kedem, before you do that, sorry, do you think that there's a difference between a jurisdictional element and a status element like this one? "}, {"speaker": "Allon Kedem", "text": " I think it's not a difference in kind.   I think it goes to the point that Justice Alito was making, namely, that there are some things that we presume people either are aware of or are on notice of or it's just not the type of thing that Congress would want to have to prove to a jury. And there are other things that Congress would assume that we would prove to a jury.   We -- our argument is that legal status is the type of thing, especially the defendant's own legal status, that Congress would not have wanted to require. And that becomes even clearer when you see that every time in 922 that Congress wants to require proof of some mental state with respect to the legal status, it is explicit about it.   We've mentioned subsections (d), subsections (h), (a)(6).   We've talked about subsection (n).   We talked about (g)(8).   Those are all instances where Congress might have worried that someone wouldn't know, for instance, the status of the person you're selling the gun to. And that's why Congress included an explicit mental state.   It did not include the same in subsection (g). "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " The inference -- the -- the rule about so-called jurisdictional elements seems to me must rest on an inference about congressional intent.   And the argument against reaching a similar inference with respect to a defendant's status is that, in a case like this one, the -- the conduct in question would often not be criminal were it not for the person's status.   And I think it's an overstatement to say that it's -- it's always lawful activity.   That depends on the jurisdiction. But, in any event, so can that -- can it be distinguished on that ground, or would we run into problems in the situation where the conduct in question is subject to prosecution under state law and federal law, but what the jurisdictional element does is to make it much more serious, to impose a much more serious penalty? "}, {"speaker": "Allon Kedem", "text": " So I'm -- I'm not sure it can be distinguished on those grounds.   I'm glad that you brought up state law, because we've been talking about federal law here, but nearly every state has its own possession law. And as far as we're aware, not a single one of them requires proof that the defendant had any mental state with respect to their status, which I think is relevant in two ways. First of all, it shows that this is unlikely -- it is unlikely that states would have structured all of their laws this way if it invited abuse or routinely ensnared the innocent.   But I think it also goes to, what is the general expectation of what someone is on notice of? And I think it shows that if all states are making the same assumption, that a defendant is on notice of his own status, it's not unreasonable to think that Congress was resting on the same assumption. Going now to the practical problem, Justice Gorsuch, you are 100 percent correct that, in the vast majority of cases, people plead guilty.   On the other hand, we're talking about -- about 10,000 felon-in-possession offenses.   And what happens is, although it will be extraordinarily rare that a defendant, in fact, will not know that he is -- of his own status, it is something that will have to be proven at every trial, which means that the focus of the trial -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well, in practice -- practically, that won't be so because the last thing in the world that the defendant will want is for the jury to know that he committed some heinous crime. "}, {"speaker": "Allon Kedem", "text": " So that will often be the case.   It won't always be the case.   It's the easiest thing in the world for a defendant to say, I just didn't know, or even if I did know at one point that my crime was punishable by more than one year, I forgot.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " All -- all right. So -- so we're dealing with two classes of cases then if I understand your argument.   One is it's going to be easy to prove in the mine run of cases.   It's not going to a big deal.

"}, {"speaker": "Allon Kedem", "text": " Because here we're talking not just about a legal status, but the defendant's own legal status, something of which he presumably is aware or at least is charged with being aware. What a defendant can't do is say: I don't remember when my visa was going to expire and, you know what, I'm not going to bother to figure out, because as long as I remain ignorant, even recklessly ignorant about my own status, that means that I can't face liability. If I could just tie together the various strands of our textual argument.   It is first that you are separating out knowingly violates from the regulatory prohibition, which this Court has read to mean that it's a reference to the specific acts or omissions that violate the prohibition. Two, the fact that you're dealing with the defendant's own legal status. Three, the fact that knowingly violates, if you import the knowing requirement, produces all sorts of double mental states or incompatible mental states under subsections (d), (h), and (a)(6). Four, the fact that Congress was always explicit in 922 when it wanted to require a particular mental state with respect to background circumstances. And, five, in the two instances where Congress thought that maybe someone reasonably wouldn't be on notice of their status, it made specific provision of those. All of that, combined with the 50-year history that Congress had at its fingertips when it enacted FOPA in 1986, moreover the fact that if Congress had a problem with the way every court of appeals in the country has interpreted FOPA, presumably it would have done something about that in the last 30 years. And yet even though 922 and 924 have been modified more than a dozen times, Congress has not done so. If there are no further questions.

"}, {"speaker": "Allon Kedem", "text": " Sure.   So the government's view is that under Bousley, the defendant would have to show on collateral review that he was actually innocent, meaning he actually did not know about his status. But, of course, any defendant could raise that argument and would have every incentive to try and raise that argument. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Six minutes, Ms. Cakmis. "}, {"speaker": "Rosemary T. Cakmis", "text": " Thank you, Your Honor. First, I'd just like to point out I think that 10,000 a year prosecutions under this statute is somewhat overstated in that the sentencing commission has indicated in the past 15 years there's only been 65,000. But, regardless, the bulk of them are under the felon-in-possession.   And we acknowledge that the bulk of the time there's not going to be a problem. But that small but significant number of cases there is a problem in, where there is honest miss-advice by a judge, and the defendant believes the judge, is he supposed to inquire further and say: Judge, you're wrong? We would respectfully submit that's not practical or fair. In essence, the government says it's not adding or complaining of its burden, but, rather, is concerned about the added burden on the jury and the jury confusion, but virtually every statute has knowledge and the jury sorts it out.   That's what they do. The government is, in effect, asking this Court to create a whole new rule, a rule that relieves it of its burden to prove the only critical fact that makes firearm possession in this country illegal, and that fact is status. Our reading, applying it to the status, is consistent with the plain language of the statutes, with this Court's canons of statutory construction, and with the purpose of FOPA in inserting knowledge in the first place. Congress did something different. Prior to FOPA, knowledge was not in the statute.   It's there now. The fact that other Congresses afterwards have not changed it adds very little weight in this very weak canon this Court has described. And for all those reasons, we'd ask the Court to reverse.
