And that is precisely what occurred here.   My clients were required, in violation of Regulation B in ECOA as spousal guarantors, to become jointly and severally liable to repay the debts of their husbands' business, which clearly qualifies them as applicants both under the straightforward language of ECOA, as well as the Regulation B that was adopted by the regulators. In this particular instance, as in many credit transactions, the real applicants in this transaction are not a to-be formed limited liability company or corporation, but the persons that will stand as guarantors behind that company.

First of all, spouses who are required to sign jointly and severally with their husbands' businesses and their husbands are going to undertake potential adverse credit consequences in the future. Let me give you an example.   Divorce or death of the primary operator of the business.   If the wife has become jointly and severally liable to repay the husband's debt, she then is going to be strapped with his credit profile in a business that she never had any operational authority, that she never was involved in, and she wasn't an investor on.   She was simply required to sign because she was the spouse of the husband.   And what's important to understand in these cases -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Wait, wait, wait.   You say she was required to sign.   She wasn't required to sign. Somebody put a gun to her head? She wanted the husband to get the loan, and this was the deal. "}, {"speaker": "John M.

"}, {"speaker": "John M. Duggan", "text": " I'd agree.   She signed the guaranty by virtue of a condition being placed upon the extension of credit to her husband and the lend -- and the borrowing entity.   And what's important to understand is that in these cases, these borrowing entities, and in this very case, which typifies these small business organizations, that, in fact, it's never really the \"to-be formed limited liability company\" that's the borrower, it's always the guarantors. We need to look no farther than Doc 79-7, Page 1 to 3, which is the bank's actual approval of this credit application.   In that document, which was a part of the trial court record, the bank, in responding to its own internal write-up on the operating history and the potential for the entity to pay back the debt, it said \"nonapplicable.\" Financial projections of the borrowing entity? \"Nonapplicable.\" The precise reason to approve the loan, \"I recommend approval of this loan request based on the financial strength of the guarantors and our collateral position.\" The only collateral that was ever taken in that transaction was the collateral of the guarantors. To suggest that guarantors are not the real applicants in these loan transactions is to be divorced from reality.   They are the true applicants.

And in this particular case, I believe that anybody who signs a written contract that says, I have independent obligations to perform under my guaranty that make me jointly and severally liable to repay the debt in full, and if I fail to perform, I agree to repay the applied-for debt in totality, I don't know how in the world that person is not somebody who is appealing to and requesting that credit be extended by putting their own financial wherewithal and capacity to repay the loan on the line based on their own independent requirement to perform. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Under your -- under your view -- let me understand the theory of the case.   Let's say that you prevail, that a guarantor is an applicant and that there is a violation of the duty to the guarantor and that there are five guarantors.

Duggan", "text": " No, the loan cannot be declared unenforceable under the laws that exist today.   The only thing that could be declared unenforceable would be the spousal guaranties which are deemed illegal under Regulation B.   Not all of the guarantors can bring a claim.   The husbands can only bring a claim to the extent they suffer damage as a result of their wives being required to be guarantors on the case. Mr. Chief Justice, I see that my time is limited.   I may like to reserve the remainder for rebuttal, if there are no further questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Counsel. "}, {"speaker": "John M.

"}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 30 years, Regulation B has provided that guarantors, cosigners, and other similar parties to credit transactions, qualify as applicants, are entitled to protection from discrimination under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Additional Parties rule.   That longstanding regulation is reasonable, and it reflects a reasonable interpretation of the Act's broad definition of the term \"applicant.\" "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, we've been talking about applicants -- is it -- is the person an applicant in the abstract? But one of the important things about context here is there are two terms, \"applicant\" and \"guarantor.\" And that's the way it's always worked in the industry.   Somebody in the industry would not call a guarantor an applicant.   The person is a guarantor.   So I just wonder how we can pluck \"applicant\" out.   Obviously, in some sense, anybody who is supporting the loan, you know, you can describe, well, they're applying for it.   But there's a separate term, \"guarantor.\" And if you ask somebody, well, what is this person? Is this person an applicant? They would say, no, it's a guarantor. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the term \"guarantor\" doesn't appear in the statute.   And I don't think it's true that the term \"applicant\" and \"guarantor\" have fixed meanings in the industry and that you could never construe a guarantor to be an applicant. I think, in fact, often, as we explain in our brief, guarantors and cosigners might fill out the same application and join together in the same application that they submit to the borrower in seeking the loan. And so I -- I don't think there's an industry understanding that you can't reasonably regard a guarantor or a cosigner or another secondary obligor who's playing that sort of -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Wait.   Do you think there's an industry understanding that there are guarantors and there are applicants?

"}, {"speaker": "", "text": " I think certainly after the loan had been extended, you would -- you would use the term \"borrower.\" But I think if you look at the -- the context in which Congress used the term, it wrote a very broad statute.   It said, \"It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction.\" And then it defined an applicant to be any person who applies to a creditor directly for an extension, renewal, or continuation of credit. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Would you disagree that in ordinary speech, an applicant is understood, as Judge Colloton said, to be someone who is asking for something for himself or herself? And if you don't agree with that, could you give me your best example of the situation in ordinary speech in which the term \"applicant\" is used to refer to someone who is not asking for something personally? "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Justice Alito, I agree that very often, applicant refers to the person who's going to receive the thing that's being sought.   I don't think, though -- and this is what the other side has to convince you of -- that it unambiguously excludes any other meaning.   And in terms of my best examples in terms of ordinary speech, I think the one that Justice Breyer gave earlier was a good one. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, let me come back to that.   Suppose that this child is rejected for kindergarten, and then the parent is glum the next day at work.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Fletcher, in -- in some ways, the Agency itself has admitted that this is not the most natural reading of the term.   When the Agency explained why it was articulating this rule, it said, well, the problem is that Section 706 of the Act confers standing to sue only upon an aggrieved applicant.   And so we have to come in and kind of fix that. And -- and so, too, the regulation itself talks about applicants and additional parties as though the two are different.   And then the regulation, as I think Justice Scalia said, says, well, this -- this is our definition of applicant, but it's really only for this purpose, not throughout the statute.   And all of those, it seems to me, are quasi-admissions that this is not the most natural way to read the word \"applicant.\" "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Justice Kagan, I'm glad you brought that up because I very much disagree that that's how the Agency has viewed this.   I think, in particular, you referred to the way that the Agency described the change it was making in 1985, when it amended the regulation to expressly include guarantors for certain purposes.   And you're right.   They said, we're doing this because courts have ruled guarantors out of court. But the reason that it said that was not that it believed that guarantors were unambiguously excluded by the statute or that it was rewriting the statute.   It did that because between 1977 and 1985, the Agency's own regulation had expressly said that applicants do not include guarantors, cosigners, and other similar parties.   And so the courts that had said that guarantors didn't get to bring a suit were pointing to the Agency's regulation and says this statute only protects applicants.   And the Agency is telling us expressly that you as a guarantor aren't an applicant. And so the Agency came in in 1985, and it said, our own regulation, our previous version of our regulation, which excluded guarantors, is creating this problem, and we want to fix it by defining them to be applicants. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " But you -- you don't -- you don't solve a problem by -- by fixing a definition.   I mean, why was it a problem? It -- it was not a problem if applicant meant what the prior regulation said it meant.   Why was that a problem? "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Well, I think -- I think it was a problem because it left guarantors who had been improperly required to sign loan documents without a remedy. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yeah.   But that's what the law read.   I mean, if that's a problem, it was a problem with the law. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Well, that was a problem with the Agency's own prior regulation, which expressly excluded guarantors.   When the Agency -- and let me step back. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Can I just start? Why did you have to pass the first regulation at all? What caused you -- if it was as clear as Justice Scalia believes, why did you need the regulation at all saying it doesn't include? "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " So if I could just give you a little bit of the history of how the regulation developed.   The Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed in 1974.   When the Agency, the Federal Reserve Board, first passed regulations in 1975, it just incorporated the statutory definition of applicant in relevant part. It didn't speak to the guarantor question one way or another. But in 1976, just a year later, it added a substantive provision that made clear that at that time in 1976, it regarded guarantors as applicants.   It said that for purposes of a provision of the regulation -- and this is something we cite at Page 7 of our brief -- for purposes of a provision of the regulation, it required creditors to give notice of their credit decisions to applicants.   If you have multiple applicants, creditor, you can just give notice to one of them.   But then the regulation provided you may not give that notice to an applicant who is a secondary obligor, such as a surety or a guarantor. So the Agency's first interpretation was actually that the -- the plain language of the statute, which had been incorporated into the regulation, included guarantors. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Isn't it correct that this issue matters only where there are adverse -- where the -- the borrower and the guarantor have adverse interests? And if that's correct, how often does that arise? "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " So Justice Alito, I think it's particularly important where the borrower and the guarantor have adverse interests for the -- for instance, if there's been a divorce.   And so the spouses' interests are no longer aligned.   Then I think it's very, very important.   But I don't think it matters only in those cases.   And this goes to -- to the question that Justice Kagan raised earlier, which is why does this matter? And the reason that it matters is that a guarantor who's improperly required to provide a guaranty suffers a unique economic injury that is not suffered by the applicant.   So in -- in a common case, the lender says, I won't extend this loan without a signature from your spouse.   And everyone agrees that that's a violation of Regulation B, and everyone agrees that that's not permitted. And if, in that case, the spouse provides the signature, as often happens, then the primary applicant, the borrower, hasn't suffered any harm at all.   They've gotten the loan that they wanted.   So they have suffered discrimination in some sense, and they would have a claim in some sense.   But in many cases, they're not going to have economic damages to assert in court. The guarantor, on the other hand, oftentimes will have that obligation on her credit report immediately.   It could adversely affect her credit scores immediately.   And as we explain in our brief, if there's a default on the underlying loan, then that's going to be a black mark that's going to tarnish the guarantor or the cosigner's credit going forward even if she ultimately pays the debt. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " One of the things that Judge Posner said against your interpretation is that this actually creates liability on a scale that Congress wouldn't have expected because if you are right, the guarantor can come in and -- and declare the entire loan invalid, and -- and the damages would be much higher than it is for the borrower himself.   I mean, what's -- what's the answer to that? "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " So I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Is there an answer? It's just like, well, that's what it is. "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " Well, I think the -- the first answer is that that -- the availability of that remedy of allowing a guarantor to assert and actually invalidate the guaranty that's been illegally required, that won't be resolved one way or the other by the way you answered this question today, which is just are guarantors reasonably regarded as applicants as they've been defined for 30 years? But -- but I understand, though, why you would be interested because it is a related question of what remedies might guarantors have available.   And we think the answer to Judge Posner's question in that case is that there's nothing at all unreasonable about requiring a lender that has improperly demanded a guaranty to not be able to enjoy the benefit of that guaranty.   As we explained at the end of our brief, that's been the enforcing agency's longstanding policy when the FDIC or the Federal Reserve Board or other agencies conduct examinations of the books of banks and when they find violations of the additional party's rule like this. The remedy that they apply is to require the bank to release the improper guaranty, or in cases -- and I think this is another important point -- Regulation B doesn't prohibit spousal signatures under all circumstances.   To the extent that what the bank wants to do is ensure that in the event of a default, it's going to be able to reach specific property that the primary applicant is relying on, it can require a signature from the spouse, not for personal liability, but just to allow it to reach the property that is being relied upon to support the loan. And so if -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "", "text": " I was just going to say, so in that case, I think the proper remedy wouldn't be to void the loan altogether.   It would be to give the lender what it had the right to demand, which was a more limited instrument. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Can -- can you explain quickly -- I know -- uncertain.   I accept the point that I could be a rejected application for kindergarten on behalf of my -- I've said -- I've got that.   But what is this actually about? The law says you cannot discriminate against a borrower, for example -- for example -- by saying that you, the borrower, has to -- have to have a guarantor from someone you're married to.

"}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   So that's where we start.   Now, if the applicant were just the applicant for the credit himself, what would be wrong with that?

Any example at all from a magazine having to do with finance, from anything you can find where, in fact, in the context of financial transactions, there are references to a surety, a guarantor, or a mortgage insurance, there is a reference to such a person with the word \"applicant\"?

And they don't use the word \"applicant,\" but they talk about who's regarded as receiving an extension of credit.   And this is our secondary argument, Justice Alito. Even if you think that an applicant is only someone who seeks something for themselves, we think a guarantor is reasonably regarded as seeking an extension of credit for themselves.   As we explain on page 24 of our brief, for purposes of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, lenders and other banks rely every day on reading the Fair Credit Reporting Act to mean that the same definition of credit -- of credit, which refers to the extension of credit, includes a guaranty. The authority in the Fair Credit Reporting Act that allows a lender, who has a prospective guarantor before him, to look at that guarantor's credit report is a provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that says you can pull the credit report of someone who's going to receive an extension of credit in connection with the transaction. And we cite there a 2001 letter from all of the banking regulators that explains in detail why it is reasonable to regard guarantors and other secondary obligors as receiving an extension of credit, and why, in fact, that's essential to the effective administration of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

The question is simply: Is the statute ambiguous with respect to whom it covers?

But the statute's definition of credit, that is defined explicitly just like applicant.   And it's part of the applicant definition.   And credit means a right to defer payment of debt.   A cosigner and a guarantor never have a right to defer payment of debt.   If they become responsible, they were responsible then.   So what that is contemplating, in our view, is the borrower.   It's the person who's making the regular payments.   That's what's encompassed in the statutory definition. I would refer the Court also to comparable civil rights statutes of this era.   In particular, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the AIDS Discrimination and Employment Act.   All of them use the word \"person\" to describe who can bring a claim.   In the ECOA, Congress very deliberately chose something narrower, and not only did it choose it, but it expressly defined it in the statute. And we describe this as a gateway provision. We don't argue that the Fed doesn't have broad authority in many respects in implementing the ECOA.

The son or daughter is actually ultimately going to be the applicant.   The parent may well be a cosigner.

The language we think, but if you look at the legislative history, the point was to get the credit in the hands of people who were being denied, in particular, women. That is the applicant.   So the way the statute is intended to work, and works just fine with the definition of applicant we use, is to say when that person shows up, and the bank says, oh, no credit for you unless a spouse signs, the violation has occurred then.   And the discrimination is against the person who wanted to borrow the money.   The government may wish that the discriminatory provisions were broader than that, but that's the way the statute works. So the applicant has a claim, the borrower who is told you need more signatures -- otherwise, you could imagine scenarios -- I think one of the amicus briefs spins out one where, say, the person comes in and the bank says, I need -- because you're of a certain religion or a certain race, I need 15 guarantors for your -- well, all 15 guarantors can simply say no, but under their view, all 15 guarantors actually have a claim under the ECOA.

Usually, this is focused on the application itself.   So again, if you have the case of multiple guarantors, the bank turns down the borrower, then they're under obligation, if you take that view of the statute, to notify everyone who had any connection to the transaction.   But the Agency has long said that is not required.   The Agency's commenter -- if you look at -- if you look at supplement one, the interpretations of the regs and other commentary by the agencies, except for this purpose, the Agency always talks about guarantors as different than joint applicants, co-borrowers.   No one in the industry would think of these two things as the same. To come back to the Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice's point, a bank would not say a borrower is equivalent to a guarantor.   Not even close.   They're two very different things. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " No.   They certainly wouldn't say a borrower is equivalent to a guarantor.

Is it there is consideration, and the consideration has to do with the fact that credit is going to a third-party, right? And so the guarantor is stepping in and saying, I'm asking for something and I'm getting something when I enter into this contract, and that's the credit will go not to me, but to a third party. So the question I think is, like, why should that be, you know -- just because it's to a third party, the appeal, the request to the application is as to a third party rather than to yourself, why that should make any difference if the question is just what does applicant mean? Applicant doesn't have to be for yourself. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen R. McAllister", "text": " Well, I -- I agree that's the consideration for the guaranty.   But what that opens the door to, Your Honor, is there have been 60 or 70 reported ECOA decisions since the change in 1985.   More than half of those are within the last five years. After the 2008 crash, massive defaults, this is coming up more and more for banks as a defense. And if I can just have one minute, I'll tell you where this leads for banks.   So if the rule is a spousal guaranty can be voided -- and that's what -- the relief sought.   They're not asking for damages.   They want to invalidate, void the entire guaranty.   That was Judge Posner's point.   So if that is the rule, what is a bank to do when a married person comes in and seeks credit? Well, one thing the bank may do is say only secured credit because I cannot rely on any guaranty.   I can't even rely on a spousal guaranty if the spouse says I want to give the guaranty, because when this goes in a bad direction and it's time to collect, then years later, that spouse may do what these spouses have done and say I was required to do this, this was a violation of the statute.   And at a minimum, the lender is then engaged, as this lender has been, in extensive litigation costs just to even try to resolve the situation. All of that leads to lenders are going to be less likely to want to -- to lend to married couples except if they are secure in their loans.   And that may mean you have to put up assets, a guaranty no longer suffices, and it may mean you have to get more guarantors because they can't rely on the spouse.   None of that furthers the purpose of the ECOA, which was to get the credit in the hands of people who were at that time being discriminated against. So the fundamental problem with Reg B is it opens the door.   And now that the lawyers have discovered this provision and are bringing it up regularly, it will have a dramatic impact on the credit industry. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " On the -- on the question of the guarantor entering a contract just as the borrower enters a contract, the two contracts are quite different.   The borrower enters a bilateral contract, I promise to pay back the money if you -- with interest if you promise to lend me the money.   The guarantor is -- is asking for a unilateral contract.   The guarantor is just saying, I make no promises, but if you lend money to this person that I'm guarantying and that person defaults, I'll make good.   That's -- that's a unilateral contract, which doesn't bind the -- the lender at all.   It's if the lender chooses to do that, I'll stand good for the -- for the default.

The guarantor must provide financial statements to the lender.   The guarantor must fulfill all other obligations and any other agreement that the guarantor has with the lender.

Number one, husbands and wives can come under the regulation safe harbors as joint applicants contemporaneously and say we want joint credit.   It's only a violation of the Act if the lender, once an independent spouse comes forward and says I want credit, says as a condition to me extending you the credit you want, you must bring your spouse along. The second thing is I think this regulation has got to be the easiest regulation to comply with.   A, B, C, 1, 2, 3.   There's safe harbors under the regulation.   If a lender is relying upon jointly owned assets of a husband and wife, the regulation and the statute, 1691(d), create a specific safe harbor that says get a security interest in the asset and don't get a guaranty, or simply ask the spouse to waive her marital interest in the jointly-owned property so that if in fact you have to execute on that jointly-owned property to collect the debt, you're permitted to do that.   Two very simple safe harbors to comply with. What they don't want you to do is to strap the spouse with the potential adverse credit in the future where she has to use her income or her earnings or her ability to get future credit to pay off either a divorced or deceased spouse.   One of the rationales. Makes a ton of sense. Back to the other points that were made. The application here, the dictionary definitions run the gamut, but they all have two specific statements. Appeal or request.   And the statute here says they repeal -- applies for an extension renewal of credit. Doesn't say of credit to the borrower.   Doesn't say of a loan to the borrower.   It says of credit generically. And back to Justice Breyer's comments, in fact, why in the world that somebody who becomes contractually, jointly and severally liable to repay the debt in full and says, I have my independent obligations under my guaranty, and if I don't perform, you can collect the entire debt from me, how is that person in that context not saying to the lender, I am appealing to you and requesting an extension of credit? I'll go so far as to say I'll stand behind the loan, and I have my independent obligations to perform under the guaranty. And if I don't perform, I'll pay.   That, to me, can be nothing but an applicant. Thank you so much for your time.   I'm happy to answer any questions if there are any. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
