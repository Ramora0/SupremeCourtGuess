[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We will hear argument this morning in Case 21-376, Haaland versus Brackeen, and the consolidated cases. Mr. McGill. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: According to the federal government, in 2020, there were over 11,000 Native American children in state foster care.   The Indian Child Welfare Act deprives Native -- deprives Indian children of the best interests of the child test.   It replaces that test with a hierarchy of placement preferences that puts Native -- non-Indian families at the bottom of the list. As this Court explained in Holyfield, this effectuates a federal policy of sending Indian children to the Indian community.   The problem is -- is that there are fewer than 2,000 Native American foster homes.   That means each year hundreds, if not thousands, of Indian children are placed in non-Indian foster homes, and sometimes there they bond with those families.   Yet, when those families try to adopt those children, ICWA rears its head for a second time, allowing tribes to play the proverbial ICWA trump card at the eleventh hour. This is happening now for a second time to the Brackeens as they try to adopt YRJ, who is now four-and-a-half years old.   For a second time, the Brackeens are asked to show good cause to overcome the placement preferences under a new regulatory standard that, in the agency's words, is narrow, limited, and not a best interests test.   Not even YRJ's deep attachment to the Brackeens after being part of their family for four years is sufficient.   For both that child and her family, this flouts the promise of equal justice under the law. I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Would you spend a minute on what the good cause standard is? I think -- of course, you understand that there's already a placement, there's already adoption in process, but how does that work? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Justice Thomas, the -- after the 2016 rule, what the -- what at 25 C.F.R. 23.132, you now -- there are now five enumerated ways in which good cause can be shown.   The government says that it mere -- that the regulation merely says that it should be one of these five factors.   But, you know, a remarkable thing happens when a family court judge in the states picks up a copy of the Code of Federal Regulations.   He treats it as binding federal law.   And that is how it happens on the ground.   It is treated as enumerated things that must be shown. Further, it excludes any consideration of socioeconomic circumstances of the -- of the competing families.   And, finally, it says that what the regulation describes as ordinary bonding and attachment that arises from a placement that's in violation of ICWA's placement preferences shall not be a sufficient or sole basis for showing good cause. And, of course, the child at issue in these proceedings has no stake in whether she or he was placed in supposed violation of ICWA's preferences at the foster care -- at the foster care process. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, you haven't challenged the regulation? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Yes, we have, Your Honor. We have a challenge to -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But not in the cert granted question? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your Honor, we challenged the -- we raised a challenge in our complaint to the -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm not asking about the complaint.   The cert granted question does not include challenges to the regulation? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " It -- it challenges the -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " It opposes the statute? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " We challenged the regulation as an unconstitutional -- as an implementation of a -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, answer the question.   Is it part of the question presented or not? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " I believe it is, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Did you seek cert on that question? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " We did not seek cert on the question of the -- whether it is a permissible construction of the statute.   We sought cert on whether the statute -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So, if it -- if you don't seek cert on that, there's nothing on that good cause standard? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " I don't -- I don't think so, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Counsel, can I turn to something you said, which was it displaces the best interests of the child standard.   In most state custody proceedings, the best interests of the child is what guides those decisions. Yet, we have the Hague Convention on the abduction of children that basically says to the court you can't make that determination, you have to send the child back, and it gives a session -- section of exceptions, et cetera, and it even says standards of proof, et cetera. Why is this case any different than the Hague Convention? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " For, I think, a couple of reasons, Your Honor.   First, the Hague Convention, as I understand it, would send the child back to their place of their habitual residence. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But that's not necessarily in the best interests of the child. There's no best interests standard there. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " What I was -- if I might just finish my thought, Your Honor.   That is -- that habitual residence standard is -- is essentially duplicated in Section 1911(a), which provides for tribes -- tribal courts to have exclusive jurisdiction concerning children who are domiciled on -- on tribal lands. So I think that -- that that parallels the Hague Convention.   The other -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, how? Meaning these children are in the U.S., they have a relationship with an Indian tribe over which we have recognized for over two centuries Congress has plenary -- plenary authority. If Congress in one enumerated power can supersede a state standard, why can't it in another? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Well, Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They can say the best interests of the child shouldn't be the top test or only test, either good cause or something else, as ICWA does. Why is that beyond Congress's power? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " I'm not aware that an equal protection challenge has ever been presented to the Hague Convention.   If you -- if you're referring -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You -- you -- you think that Congress's foreign affairs powers don't permit it to legislate with respect to the relationships of a foreign country and its competing custody issues? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your Honor, I think the foreign affairs power is subject to the Fifth Amendment.   I think the question of whether citizenship is a -- would be -- would rise to the level -- a classification based on citizenship would amount to race discrimination would, you know, essentially be the question of whether citizenship is being used as a proxy for race.   The government -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, to what extent is the best interests of the child or the same considerations that are taken into account under the best interests of the child incorporated in the good cause showing that could be made under ICWA? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " I would say that they are not, Your Honor.   I mean, the -- the good cause standard is -- is a holistic standard that takes all of the child's circumstances and needs into account. What the good cause standard does is sharply limit that under the 2016 rule to enumerated factors.   In the 2013, when the adoptive couple case was before this Court, the government described the good cause standard as a safety valve.   That's Footnote 2 of its brief. It is no longer a safety valve.   The Interior Department has promulgated these regulations with the specific purpose of making it limited, narrow, and, in its own words, not a best interest test.   So it differs very much from the -- what would be the traditional best interest test. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So how do you understand this to work? I mean, if you have, for example, an Indian couple, non-tribal members of the -- the tribe of the child, exactly how does the state court adoption authority take into account -- how -- how -- how do they weigh the interests of the non-family tribe member against -- you say you don't take into account the best interests of the child? What are you weighing on the other side? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Well, I think you could look to the Texas Court of Appeals decision in the YRJ case as just an example of this.   So the question is whether -- whether the -- the person challenging the placement preference has shown one of the enumerated factors by, at that time, clear and convincing evidence. The that -- that standard of proof has since fallen by the wayside.   So that's how it -- it plays out on the ground.   Is one of those five factors demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence? It doesn't -- you know, it -- it does not -- those five factors don't take into account the bonding or attachment of the child, which would be the most obvious and most compelling part of the best interest standard. It only says if there's, you know, a showing of extraordinary needs that -- that -- that is, you know, not just something that is from what the regulation describes as ordinary bonding and attachment that good cause can be shown. I mean, the -- the -- after the 2016 regulation, the -- the placement preferences are effectively dispositive in many cases. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Counsel, can I take you to the scope of the Indian power? We've described it as plenary.   It's quite broad. And, in area after area, we've -- well, the -- we've allowed Congress to far exceed anything that we would think of as just commerce in the sense of trade, you know, which is something that you floated. Are you asking us to overrule all of those precedents? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " No, Your Honor.   I -- I am not going to speak for my colleagues on the -- from the State of Texas, but, for our -- for our part, no, we're not -- we don't think you need to overrule any of the precedents. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Because you'd have us just focus on the equal protection? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " No, Your Honor.   I mean, on -- on the Article I piece, the -- this cannot be understood as within the -- the Court's Indian Commerce Clause precedents.   It's not commerce in any -- in any normal sense of that word. The question is then whether it is part of the plenary power that otherwise has been described in this Court's precedents.   And our submission is that that plenary power is, if -- if you -- in the Court's cases, as elaborated in this Court's cases, that plenary power applies to the tribe's areas of its sovereign interests, tribal lands, treaty powers, its internal affairs, its ability to self-govern. It's not a power to regulate Indians everywhere, wherever they might be in the jurisdiction of the United States. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what do you do with that line of cases, like the Act of 1888, setting the evidentiary standard for proving a marriage in cases involving an Indian woman and a white man? That wasn't limited territorially. That set an evidentiary standard. Or the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1834 set burdens of proof in all trials, whether on reservations or outside of reservations, about property rights between Indians and non-Indians. The Act of 19 -- 1799, state courts must take proper bail when federal officers detain offenders who trespassed into Indian territory. So that one arguably had something to do with that, but there's a legion of cases, as Justice Barrett alluded to, where Congress has gone off of Indian lands, had nothing to do with sovereignty, had to do -- nothing to do with trade or commerce -- or commerce, but with intercourse, with the relationship with Indians, whether on or off reservations. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I -- I guess my -- I would have two parts to my response. The first is that the -- the Constitution confers a -- an authority to regulate commerce, and that power, as understood, as Justice Thomas's separate opinion in Adoptive Couple, I think, would elaborate -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But that was a separate opinion.   We've described the power as more plenary than that. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Well, I -- and I think this is just the -- the fundamental portion of my submission, and I respect the fact that we might not agree on this, but that there is a commerce power that -- that allows the government to regulate commerce wherever it happens within the United States. And then there is, in addition to that, a plenary power that allows the tribes -- allows the government, the federal government, to regulate the tribes, and that arises from the federal government's, you know, role as the subjugating sovereign of the tribes and its role as the, now under Kagama, the protector of those tribes.   But that power is not unlimited.   It doesn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Well, why -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- is it limited by geography? You -- you're suggesting that the power, the plenary power that you describe is limited by the tribal land demarcation, and I don't understand where that comes from. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Well, I -- I don't think it's just tribal land, Your Honor, although, as this Court's decision in Plains Commerce Bank says, that is the -- the core of tribes' sovereign interests, but it also would extend to treaty rights, the internal affairs of the tribe, and the laws that -- that address the scope and form of tribe self-government. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All right.   So you concede that Congress has plenary power over tribal sovereignty and self-government then? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Tribe -- I believe that Congress absolutely has the power to -- to adjust and change the scope of tribes' power to govern themselves. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All right.   So what do we do with the legislative history in regard to this Act in which Congress repeatedly referred to the kinds of -- of restrictions and regulations in this area in ICWA as a matter of tribal governance and self -- you know, self-government and sovereignty? I mean, Congress said things like there's no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children.   They constantly cast regulations regarding children, Indian children, as a matter of tribal integrity, self-governance, existence.   So why isn't that enough to bring it within the -- the -- the scope of their plenary power? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Addressing the tribal existence point, I have four responses to that. The first is that the third placement preference doesn't even rationally advance that objective.   Placing a Seminole child with a Cherokee family doesn't rationally advance the existence of either tribe. The second point is that placement does not dictate membership.   You need only look as far as YRJ to show that.   Tribes -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Right.   I feel like you're in the weeds of the actual regulation. What I'm asking you is the broader question about whether or not Congress has the ability to regulate in this area. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " So -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " I understood your response to Justice Barrett to be not anything outside of commerce or the plenary power expanding to or extending to self-governance and self-regulation.   So I'm just asking as a matter of categorization why aren't regulations that concern whether or not Indian children are going to remain in the tribes fitting within that plenary power? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your Honor, in Williams versus Lee, this Court described the power of self-government as the power of reservation Indians to make their own laws and to be ruled by them.   ICWA has nothing to do with that. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " What -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- counsel, I'm struggling to understand your argument.   For the first half of it, I heard policy complaints.   It took a while for me to even hear the words \"equal protection\" or \"Article I.\" And I guess I'm -- I'm curious, first of all, which do you think is your better argument -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " We're -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- legally? Not -- not -- the policy arguments might be better addressed across the street. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Justice Gorsuch, as you -- we are here to advance both arguments, but I'd like to talk about the equal protection argument. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   So, if equal protection is your better argument, what do we do about your standing problem? You've sued federal officials, not the state courts who actually are tasked with operating. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " I -- I think my answer to that, Justice Gorsuch, starts with the traceability standard, which is de facto causation.   And then I would say -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " No federal official can dictate to a state family court what to do, can he? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " I'm sorry, I did not hear the question. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Can any federal official that you sued tell a state court what to do? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " No, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   I would think that might be the end of it.   What am I missing? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Two things, Your Honor. First is the fact that the traceability standard is de facto causation.   And, as shown in the Court's decision in Bennett versus Spear, the -- the agency that issues the regulation is the de facto cause of a separate party that implements it.   That is what's going on here. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " We have a statute here.   You're asking us to enjoin somebody from operating a statute. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " We also are -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And the only people who operate this statute are state court judges -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " We're -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- and tribal judges. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " We also are asking the Court to affirm the judgment vacating the 2016 rule on the grounds that it implements an unconstitutional statute.

Let's say you've got standing.   I'm -- I'm -- I'll spot you that for the purposes of this question.   How is this an invidious racial classification rather than a political classification? Tribes are -- are mentioned in the Constitution, and, in fact, we have the treaty power which mentions tribes as separate, indicates that they're separate sovereigns. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your Honor, the Court explained in Rice versus Cayetano that tribal classifications cannot be used in regulation of state affairs.   It drew a line between the regulation -- the use of tribal classifications in regulating tribal internal affairs and regulating the affairs of the state.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Of course.   And, in Mancari, we held this was a political classification, right? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " With respect to the hiring preference there at issue. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Yeah.   Okay.   So let's turn to your Article I.   And I'm struggling to understand what it is because you seem to -- I'm sorry.   I'll -- I'll -- I'll carry on later, Chief. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Sure. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Yeah. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Thomas? "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Briefly, counsel, is there a difference between regulating a tribe or tribal affairs and regulating someone who happens to be Indian? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your Honor, I think it depends on the context.   Somebody who -- if you, by the word \"Indian\" -- "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Well, in this case, what -- I mean, I -- I don't want to get the whole range.   We're talking about children who do not reside on a reservation, right? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " They are covered by the statute, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " Who are not necessarily members of a tribe? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Correct, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " And that's what I'm interested in.   Is there a difference between regulating a tribe or a reservation and regulating someone who happens to be -- have some Indian blood? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your Honor, I -- I would submit certainly not in this case.   Congress here told us what it was doing.   It was identifying a class of persons who had blood in common.   That's at page 20 of the House report. It wanted to put the -- that class of people in the Indian community writ large. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " I don't think that's what I'm asking.   And I'll stop with this.   What I'm asking is, assuming there is plenary authority for the national government to treat with or regulate tribal affairs and affairs on reservations or related to reservations, is there a difference when someone happens to be an Indian not on a reservation, not a part of a tribe, not associated with a tribe? Do we consider them the same, or do we consider them differently? Because that someone is also a citizen of the United States.   And I'm asking you, are we to just put them all in one ball simply because you can regulate tribal affairs? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " No, Your Honor, because, you know, at least in Mancari itself, it recognized that the -- that the hiring preference there was limited to tribal Indians. And, there, the Court recognized that Mancari -- that the hiring preference was a -- in a sui generis agency that had a special relationship in the governance of tribes qua tribes. And this, I think, is perhaps the -- you know, addresses the point of your question. There is a difference between regulating tribes as a polity and regulating persons who happen to have tribal blood as persons. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor, anything further? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You're not suggesting, but I think you may be, that Congress's power is only with respect to tribes and not Indians? They can't regulate the relationship between Indians and others, whether they're on the tribe or not? So all those laws I read about previously at the founding, they were unconstitutional to start with? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your Honor, I -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Because they had nothing to do with reservations.   They had to do with individuals. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your -- I think, you know, some of the laws you cited, I think, have, you know, serious equal protection problems, including, for instance, there's a law that's still on the books that provides for the federal government to forcibly enroll Indians in boarding schools.   That's 25 U.S.C. 302.   So there are some serious equal protection problems in some of the cases that you cited -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That might be -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " -- the statutes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- but that has nothing -- that doesn't talk to us about what you're suggesting in answer to Justice Thomas, which is that the plenary power is limited to dealing with tribes and not in -- not the treatment of individual members. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " What I was talking about with Justice Thomas, Your Honor, is how -- the -- the difference of a political classification and a racial classification.   And I -- the -- the -- our submission is that a classification is political when it -- when it regulates the tribe's, you know, sovereign interests, which is to say regulating the tribe as a polity.   When it regulates Indian land, its treaty rights -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So you're saying yes, they can't do only -- only individuals if it has to do with the limited sovereignty question? Is that what you're saying? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " As an equal protection matter -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " -- whether it -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I understand your argument. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kagan? "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I'm not sure I do, so I'm going to continue on the same vein. We have a long history of cases where we've understood legislation relating to the tribes as -- as political in nature and not as racial.   I think you have one case, which is Rice. And so I want to, on the one hand, say what do you do with this long line of cases which has consistently said, when you regulate the tribes, you're regulating political entities? And then, on Rice, you know, a very different situation.   Number one, a Fifteenth Amendment case not involved here, right to vote, but even more important than that, really, the classification did not relate to a tribe; it related to some centuries-old affiliation with Native Hawaiians, which was much harder to understand as a current-day political entity. So -- so I guess I think Rice doesn't do much for you, and then all these other cases really knock the legs out from this argument, and I'm wondering whether you would comment on that thought. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Sure.   Let me start with Rice.   I think Rice does explain those -- that long line of cases that you refer to.   It cites them, you know, I think, at page 519.   It cites Moe, Fisher, Antelope.   This is the line of cases that I think you're referring to, and these are cases that deal with tribes' sovereign interests in Indian lands, treaty rights -- that's the fishing vessel case -- the ability of Indians to govern themselves -- that's Fisher -- and its internal affairs. That is the -- that is the line that -- that Rice drew and how Rice understood Mancari and the line that Mancari itself drew. This -- this distinction that I'm drawing is rooted in Mancari itself because Mancari says that it would be a much more difficult question if the hiring preference there extended to the whole of the federal government. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, Mancari is such a different sort of case, right? Mancari is Indians are -- are -- are -- on -- in a long list of other racial classifications.   It was quite clear that -- that was the BIA one, is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Yes, that's correct. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I was -- you -- I was mistaken. But I -- I guess, again, I'm sort of struggling with how different the classification in Rice was to the classifications here. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " So I -- I understand the question, Your Honor.   Rice, this -- this was, you know, the -- at the core of the Rice decision.   Rice starts by assuming what it calls your premises not established in our case law, both that Native Hawaiians should be treated as an Indian tribe and, further, that Congress delegated to the State of the -- Hawaii the power to regulate them. That -- that -- the Court assumed that, assumed that they are an Indian tribe, that Hawaii had the power to regulate, and then it held that the tribe -- that Hawaii or Congress could not regulate a tribe in this way because it was regulating the affair of a state, not the tribe's own self-government. And I think, you know, the -- the point I -- further point I would make about Rice is that Rice -- the -- the -- the statute there had a much closer tie to self-government.   It was the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.   It had a much closer tie to self-government than the Indian Child Welfare Act. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, the first thing you need for self-government is, you know, a -- a functioning polity.   And Congress is very clear in this statute that it thinks that this statute is critical to the continuing existence of the tribe as a political entity. And that's, in fact, one of the reasons it passes this statute, is the political entity is itself being threatened because of the way decisions on the placement of children are being made. So I -- I guess I can't imagine a -- a -- a -- a statute that's more wrapped up, given -- given the terms and given what we know about what Congress was doing, is more wrapped up in the continued flourishment of political communities. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Your Honor, the placement preferences do not affect tribal membership. You can be a member of the tribe wherever you are placed.   And it is, you know, the fact that tribes often do unilaterally enroll children regardless of where they are placed. The further point I would make, Your Honor, is that embedded in -- in the -- the question is -- is a premise that tribes have a proprietary interest in these children.   And I have to reject that premise.   Tribes -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, this is Congress's understanding of what it was doing, you know, and, again, this goes back to Justice Gorsuch's view of you can question the policy, you cannot question the policy, but the policy is for Congress's to make. And Congress understood these children's placement decisions as integral to the continued thriving of Indian communities, and Congress had a different view of the costs and benefits of how these decisions were being made.   And that's not something that we can second-guess, is it? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " It is under the Constitution, Your Honor.   I -- they -- the -- the -- the -- the Congress does not have the power to treat these children as property of the tribes -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " We -- we can second -- "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " -- because of their ancestry.

The third point is that the -- that the placement -- to the extent we're talking about tribal self-government, which is to say the ability of tribes to make their own laws, the ability under Williams, reservation Indians, to make their own laws and be ruled by them, the placement preferences do not even suggest that any Indian child has to live on or near a reservation. And the fourth point, which is the most fundamental point, which is that embedded in this argument is that tribes have a proprietary interest in these -- in these children.   And they are human beings.   They are citizens of the United States and the states in which they reside.   They are persons within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.

Rice draws this line between regulation of the tribes' internal affairs and the use of tribal classifications there and the use of tribal classifications in the affairs of the state.

And I think that, you know, the important point about Rice is that there -- there -- in that case, there was a -- not just a plausible, a fairly direct tie to self-government of the indigenous people. But the Court said Mancari could not be extended to that new context because Mancari was a limited exception based on the \"sui generis\" role of the BIA in regulating Indian tribes.

I want to get a grip on how this works, you know. So that provision requires the parties seeking to effect a foster care placement or termination of parental rights to satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. And the government says, well, this applies to both private parties and state agencies.   And so it's not directed at the state agencies in compelling government action, in compelling the state to take steps. How does this work? Do private agencies in the Brackeens' case -- I mean, do private agencies initiate these proceedings, or, really, is this something that falls on the states? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D.

So I -- I think there's an aspect of your Article I argument that really boils down to a fundamental question that comes up in the law a lot, which is who decides.   Who decides whether regulation in this area counts for Indian self-government, promotes Indian self-government, has a sufficient tether? I keep hearing you say in response to many of my colleagues' questions that you think that regulation related to family affairs does not have a sufficient connection to Indian self-government.   But, in the actual legislative history of this -- of ICWA -- and I'm reading from the Federal Register -- Congress says that -- it -- it indicates that ICWA reflects its \"concern about preserving the integrity of Tribes as self-governing sovereign entities and ensuring that Tribes could survive both culturally and politically.\" That's 81 Fed. Reg. -- Federal Register 38781. So it seems to me that Congress has made a decision that regulating in this area is important for preserving the integrity of tribes as self-governing, sovereign entities, and, therefore, I don't think it's sufficient for you to say to us that you think that that's not true. So tell me how we're supposed to decide based on your view of whether or not this is a sufficient tether, as opposed to what Congress has said about it. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " I would -- first, I -- I guess I have two responses to that, Justice Jackson. First is I would look to this Court's cases that define the interest in self-government, and I would start with Williams versus Lee, which defines it as the right or the ability of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them. That -- that case has never been, you know, to my knowledge, limited or abrogated. And that is my understanding of how this Court defines the interest in self-government. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But why would that be our decision then? I'm still worried that that would be this Court displacing Congress's policy judgment around what counts. "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Because the text of the statute and its -- you know, and its operative effect does not advance the objective there. The -- if the objective is preserving the existence of tribes, the third placement preference does nothing to effectuate that. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All right.   Let me ask you another question.   You have seemed to be very upset about Congress's exercise of plenary authority over Indian affairs.   You say we need to look at it in a more narrow lens, I guess consistent with the sort of general understanding that Congress has limited authority. What I'm a little bit confused about and concerned about is whether it's really correct that we have to look at it so narrowly, that is, the scope of Congress's authority as it concerns Indian affairs, when we have said over and over again that Congress has plenary and exclusive authority, and when the history of our Constitution indicates that the constitutional design was about ensuring, in a way, that the federal government had the authority over the tribal relations, tribal affairs, and not the states. It seemed to me that baked into the Constitution's structure related to this, outside of just the Indian Commerce Clause provision, is the notion that the federal government, you know, vis-\u00e0-vis the states was going to be taking charge of this, especially in light of the Articles of Confederation precedent. So, if that's the case, then what -- what would you say about the thought that rather than, you know, searching for, you know, what additional limits there are on Congress's authority, we start with the premise that, with respect to Indian affairs, Congress has plenary authority and, therefore, as we've said in all of these prior cases, as long as it involves Indian affairs and Congress is making policy judgments, they have a constitutional basis for doing so? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Justice Jackson, if -- if the -- if this arises from the constitutional structure, as you suggested, then it has to be the United States Govern -- the -- the United States Government's regulation of tribes as on a government-to-government basis.   That's the constitutional structure point. And if we're talking about regulating tribes as government -- governments, we are talking about regulating their residual sovereign interests, which are, as I described, in Indian lands, it -- their treaty rights. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Yeah, but do you dispute that there's a trust relationship? My understanding was that, yes, we're talking sovereign to sovereign but that as a part of that was the understanding that the United States was the greater sovereign, that it was taking over the Indian sovereignty and, therefore, had a trust relationship that arose in that context and they were responsible for Indian affairs as a result. Do you dispute that? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " We don't -- of course, we do not dispute the existence of the trust relationship.   All we're saying is that the power that Congress exercises that has been described as plenary is limited in some way by the -- by the sovereign interests that -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " So you're saying that Congress -- Congress can carry out and effectuate its trust relationship but only in the limited ways that you are now articulating? "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " No, Your Honor.   I think what we're saying is that there -- you don't have to do anything with respect to -- the federal government's trust relationship with Indian tribes to recognize that that power does not extend to regulating the placement of Indian children in state courts.

With respect to commandeering, where Justice Barrett took you, do you have a case that is older than the early 1990s related to the commandeering principle? Is that the first time -- I tried to look back to figure out where anti-commandeering came from as a constitutional concept. And I'll tell you why I'm concerned about it, because I think it's relatively recent and I'm just trying to understand whether it even conceivably applies to an area in which we have already or long recognized that the federal government has this sort of plenary authority because states were interfering with Indian affairs. And so it seems to me odd that we would suddenly say in this area using a relatively new anti-commandeering principle that the federal government can't do what it has long done in terms of taking control of this area away from the states related to Indian affairs.

Stone, II", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress cannot require states to administer a nationwide child custody regime. As far as the state is aware, this Court has upheld only three kinds of laws even under a plenary congressional power over Indian tribes: first, those regulating trade or implementing treaties with tribes in the ordinary, original understandings of those clauses; second, those applying to Indians within U.S. territories or on Indian lands; and, third, those regulating tribal governments as such. ICWA far exceeds this plenary power, applying only to child custody proceedings in state courts off reservations. Even if Congress could establish such a scheme, however, it cannot order states to enforce it.   ICWA issues a dozen commands to states or their officials.   Each obscures federal accountability for ICWA, and each foists uncompensated costs on to states.   Each is, therefore, prohibited under Murphy. And I welcome the Court's questions. "}, {"speaker": "Clarence Thomas", "text": " General Stone, it would profit us that if you would address your standing in this case, particularly since it seems that, to the extent that you're representing parents or potential parents, they can represent themselves, and I think it would be good to get an explanation of your standing. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Certainly, Your Honor. First and foremost, consistent with West Virginia versus EPA from last term, Texas is, in fact, the regulated party, the party obligated to implement ICWA from beginning to end. As this Court put it in West Virginia, the fact that West Virginia and similar states were the ones who were required to cut emissions and otherwise alter their energy distribution, that was enough to leave \"little doubt\" as to their standing for the entirety of the Clean Power Plan. Second, Texas's -- Texas stands to lose substantial amounts of Medicare -- or, rather, Social Security Part IV-B and Part IV-E money.   In 2018, Texas received $410 million underneath those parts.   Those parts are expressly conditioned on Texas taking affirmative steps to comply with ICWA.   And the regulations implementing those sections, 45 C.F.R. 1355.34 and 36, make clear in mandatory language that if Texas does not, in fact, do so, if any state does not do so, in mandatory language, the -- the relevant administrative entity shall withhold through a complex formula up to 42 percent of that -- of that $410 million.   For Texas, that comes out to about $172 million for an agency with a $2.4 billion budget, so a very significant amount. And then, finally, speaking as to their specific equal protection injury, aside from the fact that it costs us money to implement the equal protection violating provisions, for example, we have to determine whether or not an individual is an Indian child pursuant to the regulations and the statute. Aside from that, there's a unique conjunction of constitutional obligations here that because this Court has held in Adarand that the federal equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause essentially have the same commands, any command by the federal government that violates the Fifth Amendment, that imposes a mandatory requirement on states to essentially carry out that equal protection violative component, requires the states to violate equal protection. And that is a unique constitutional injury that Texas as a state, as an actor, suffers. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " This is quite a theory you have.   Every time that a state has to interpret a federal law that might be unconstitutional, the state has standing even if that law hurts somebody else.

Stone, II", "text": " Well, the final rules preamble helps solve this question as specifically to -- to the active efforts provision, where the final rule states that the active efforts provision in ICWA was intended to make states provide substantive services to Indian families.   It comes out in -- in express language to make states, in fact, incur that cost to provide social services. That's the heart of what Murphy was cautioning about, is that specifically a command best understood as requiring a state to do a thing, especially when it either hides political accountability or foists uncompensated costs on the states, is in the heartland of the anti-commandeering doctrine.   This, under that second branch, is an easy case for purposes -- for purposes specifically of active efforts. We have other provisions we're challenging with other bases I'd be happy to discuss if -- if you're curious, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Amy Coney Barrett", "text": " Well, recordkeeping seems to go a bit farther than some of our other cases.   We reserved that in Printz. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " This Court reserved it in Printz with some very specific caveats, I agree, Your Honor.   Specifically, the Court said it might, in fact, be permissible, given that -- and as Justice Scalia noted, it was unclear in that case -- given that those courts regarding the naturalization oaths may well have volunteered essentially to that jurisdiction. And then it becomes a case of, if the courts are willingly serving for purposes of doing this federal thing, that then it's a much smaller intrusion, commandeering or not, for them to have an ancillary paperwork burden. Of course, states aren't volunteering for ICWA in the first place.   And I think the thinness of the historical evidence specifically on this point comes from the seven laws that Respondents cite.   Of those, two of them are patently unconstitutional on other grounds.   One is one of the Alien and Sedition Acts.   Another is essentially a law that required a court make a determination on pension eligibility that was reviewable by an executive branch.   So those tell us nothing about the Constitution because they're riven with a plain constitutional violation. Two more essentially have nothing to do with states at all, or one more has nothing to do with states at all, which is the Homesteading Act of 1862.   Does not mention state courts or state governments in any way. Cannot possibly tell us anything about anti-commandeering. Two more past that make it permissible but not mandatory for states to accept bail regarding certain federal fugitives or federal prisoners.   And the only two left are the same two that are mentioned in Printz regarding recordkeeping for naturalizations, with -- which this Court looked at as essentially not enough to determine the question even there. So the laws they give as historical evidence are far from something to demonstrate even what Printz showed, let alone enough generalized no courts component. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " But, Mr. Stone -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel, before you -- "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- that assumes that anti-commandeering applies in this entire area. And can you speak to my concern about that? I understood from New York versus United States that anti-commandeering rests on the premise that Congress has the power to regulate individuals and not states, which may well be true as a general matter, but, in terms of Indian affairs, we have long interpreted the Constitution to give Congress plenary authority precisely because the Constitution seems to be structured to give Congress, the federal government, power at the expense of the states with respect to Indian affairs. It's sort of like the -- the -- the -- the background principle of all of this was that states were getting involved in Indian affairs, and the Constitution says no, Congress can -- is the one that gets to direct it. I don't understand why wrapped up in that authority isn't Congress's authority to -- to direct the states to stay out of the way or to do whatever it is that's necessary to ensure that, you know, Indian affairs, Indian sovereignty is protected? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Two answers, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " One coming from this Court's case law and then one from the original materials.   One -- and this is the nearest analogue of which I'm aware -- of course, this Court was brought an argument that under the Indian Commerce Clause was a sufficiently plenary power to breach state sovereign immunity.   That's Seminole Tribe, and this Court rejected that.   It not only rejected that argument, it overturned Union Gas in the process. So this Court has recognized -- it actually made this explicit in Delaware versus Weeks -- there may be a plenary power, but it is not absolute.   And the -- the lack of that absolute component has been used -- has been sort of applied for specifically preserving the sovereign prerogatives of the states before. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel -- "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " That's the -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " -- if I might interrupt, I'm sorry, but just -- I want to understand your commandeering argument.   It seems like it's centrally related to two rather modest aspects of ICWA.   One is the recordkeeping requirement, which you discussed with Justice Barrett, is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " That is one of them, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " And the other major one that you -- you cite is -- is -- is -- is the active efforts provision. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " There are others we also challenged.   Those are two of the most major, we agree. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   And -- and -- those are the major ones.   All right.   And with respect to active efforts, I'm not sure I heard an answer to Justice Barrett's question, and her question was, does it apply equally to whomever is bringing the -- the action in state court, whether it's the state as it is sometimes or private parties as it is sometimes? That active efforts requirement, does it apply to both equally? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " To both, yes; equally, no. And so, to both, yes, it is under some circumstances that private parties have to make these efforts.   Typically, that is the state, as, again, was acknowledged in the -- in the final rule.

But also, later in the active efforts provision, recall, again, in this -- in Murphy, the Court said the -- the way that the Court looks at it is, is this better looked at as a regulation of the sovereign or instead as something regulating private. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   I got it. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " The active efforts provision specifically speaks to what a state court may do with its official power. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " May I come back to the question whether the anti-commandeering doctrine applies at all when Congress is exercising its power over Indians? Excuse me. Suppose Congress enacted a law ordering the states to enact legislation relating to Indians.   Would that be a violation of the anti-commandeering doctrine? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " I think it'd be -- I think it would be about the most direct one conceivable, Justice Alito. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel, if we could turn to Article I, we've had many variations of this -- this argument.   We've heard that it has to relate strictly to commerce.   We've heard, no, later today we heard, no, it can be off-reservation.   It can be family law sometimes.   It just can't be this combination here. What -- what is -- what exactly are you asking us to adopt here? What is beyond the Article I power? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Certainly, Your Honor. So, to clear up a -- a few things that you first mentioned, we are not claiming that there is a domestic relations exception generally.   We're not saying that the powers that Congress enjoys must only be exercised on reservations or similarly. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   So -- so Congress can act off-reservation sometimes? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   And it can do domestic relations sometimes? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Yes, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Okay.   So what -- what's -- what's the magic broth that makes this somehow a problem having conceded both those points? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Certainly, Your Honor. It's because of the three components of what this Court has recognized as plenary power. The first, again, is, for example, the implementation of treaties or acts of -- that would be ordinarily understood in commerce. This Court has described, for example, Congress as having a plenary power when Congress has prohibited alcohol sales to tribes.   Of course, forbidding the sale of alcohol or forbidding any other sale of good would just be an ordinary regulation of commerce. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But you -- we disavowed that argument, that it's strictly related to commerce.   So, again, what -- what is the rule you would have us write? I'm just -- I'm just trying to figure out, how do I write the opinion? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Certainly, Your Honor. There's three components to the plenary power. One are the ordinary applications of the various powers in the Constitution -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Right. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " -- which encompass more than just -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But this goes beyond that, so let's -- where is the limit? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " The limits come from several of these Court's cases.   One, this Court has emphasized that Congress has special power. This comes from Tiger versus Western Investment Co. and Kagama itself, that the -- the -- the government has a power, specifically speaking, on regulating Indian members or, rather, Indian tribes on Indian lands themselves. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Well, but we've -- we've -- we've said that's not the limit here either.   So, again, counsel, you've said it doesn't have to be on reservation and it can be domestic relations.   So what's -- how do you write this? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Respectfully, Your Honor, Congress may act if it -- if it is in one of three essentially parcels of power. One of them isn't related to geography at all, for example, the exercise of the treaty power, the exercise of -- of the commerce power. Of course, the exercise of the territory clause would be geographically related.   But, in this first bucket, there is not a geographic component. The second, there is one, because, as this Court recognized, the power goes specifically to the soil and the people within these limits speaking of Indian country. The third is the power that Congress has essentially to act on Indian governments as governments.   So, for example, expanding or investing them with tribal immunity, extending or foreclosing their ability to prosecute crimes or for other sovereigns to prosecute crimes on their land. If Congress is acting pursuant to one of those three components, then it falls comfortably either within the Congress's enumerated powers as originally understood or the plenary power, which we are not asking this Court even to contract, let alone to overturn. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " General, I'm -- I'm curious as to where you get those three categories? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " They're a normative description of what this Court has, in fact, done or -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I mean, there's no place -- "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " -- a description, rather, of what this Court -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- there's no place where we've said these are the three categories that define what the plenary power means, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " There are two places where Congress has specifically stated that there is a special power that track the second and third categories that I'm describing.   One, for example, being for the third category regarding governments, being that the -- the tribal power -- the U.S. Government enjoys essentially a complete power that the -- that tribal immunity or tribal sovereignty exists at Congress's sufferance. Of course, to say something exists at Congress's sufferance is to say they have something like an absolute power. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yeah, I guess the only point I was making, that I'm sure that we can find places where the Court has said that Congress has power over each of these areas, but I don't think you'll be able to find a place where the Court has said what the plenary power means is these three things and these three things alone and the plenary power doesn't extend further, because, after all, the Court has said -- I mean, I -- I don't really believe in -- in reading our opinions like statutes. But, when the Court uses the phrase \"plenary power\" tens and tens of times over decades and decades, I mean, plenary means unqualified.   It means all-encompassing. Now I don't doubt what you said earlier, that it might have an occasional exception here or there, but it strikes me as a very odd way to think about plenary power to just start, like, constructing categories and -- and saying everything else is left out when we've said over and over everything, except really rare things, are in. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Two points, Your Honor. First, we agree that we are describing a power that has already left Article I constitutional bounds.   Our core exhortation is, because it is already beyond the original understanding of the powers Congress has, that this Court shouldn't extend it further. This Court has not come out and said these are the three categories and there shall be no more. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Original meaning we have Justices Marshall and Story basically using very broad language saying plenary powers means all powers in every intercourse with Indians.   And we have a series of laws that were not limited in the way that you talked about. And we've had series of laws for 200 years not limited. You are excluding from that list all of the trust obligations that include all of the things that Justice Kavanaugh asked about you, health clinics, education, marital relations, Indian women who are married to white men. These are all outside the three areas you've talked about, but Congress has legislated in them, and, certainly, as far back as the founding of our Constitution, everyone understood plenary meant anything that had to do with the intercourse with Indians, and then, clearly, with the trust obligation, the United States took, as your colleague said at the beginning, took over this dependent sovereign nation and its members. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Your Honor, I'd like to begin with your observations regarding the trust relationship and then go backwards to Story and those uses of intercourse, if you will. The -- regarding the trust obligation in Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin, or Menominee Band of Wisconsin Indians, and Jicarilla Apache Nation, this Court made clear that, of course, the Court has sometimes described a guardianship and ward relationship, a trust relationship.   It has used a number of essentially metaphors to describe the relationship between the United States and the tribes. But the obligations underneath that trust -- this is a -- this is a core component of Jicarilla -- come from positive law.   They come from statutes which dictate obligations by the United States. We certainly don't doubt that. However, they do not have a common law component where because there is, in fact, a trust, a trust relationship, that, therefore, the United States has plenary power to do as it wishes to Indians wherever. So regarding the historical understanding of intercourse, speaking specifically about Justice Story's commentaries, which my friends on the other side cite, he speaks about commerce and then speaks about trade and intercourse and compares intercourse with navigation, just as this Court did in Gibbons v. Ogden, which is to say, in Story's example, a rule, for example, about how foreign vessels are to dock in the United States, control over channels of commerce. At no point did Story comment on there being a general Indian affairs power. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this -- this new rule would -- would, I think, take a huge bite out of Title 25 of the U.S. Code, which regulates the federal government's relationship with -- with tribal members. There are healthcare provisions that Congress promises to Native Americans off reservation.   That doesn't seem to fall in any of your buckets.   Congress has permitted tribes to exercise power over environmental regulations that have indirect effects off reservation. That would -- that would seem to go too. We have laws that promise Native Americans access to sacred sites off reservation and religious liberties off reservation.   That -- that would seem to go.   And I'm not even sure maybe the liquor sale, those old precedents, but maybe that's commerce.   I don't know. But there would be a lot that would be bitten out of Title 25.   We'd be busy for the next many years striking things down. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " I don't think that's the case, Your Honor, and I'd like to start with Morton, which I think provides the first clue that that's not the case.

I'm talking about Article I. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E.

"}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But that's not -- that's simply not true.   I mean, you can state that at the podium, but, if I look through Title 25, there are healthcare promises to individual Native Americans who live in urban areas. "}, {"speaker": "Judd E.

I could go on.   I haven't really even touched the surface. Now this may be Texas's view.   It's -- it's not a view that any other state has told us its -- it shares.

One is the federal government often plays a role in mediating disputes between sovereigns in the family law area, whether it's the Hague Convention internationally or whether the Parent Kidnapping Act domestically.

So that's on the one hand. On the other hand, the fundamental principle we don't treat people differently on account of their race or ethnicity or ancestry, equal justice under law, I don't think we would ever allow, as the Court suggested in Palmore in 1984, Congress to say that white parents should get a preference for white children in adoption or that Latino parents should get a preference for Latino children in adoption proceedings.

One, that the preference or the discriminatory rule or set-aside always reached only -- and this is in Rice -- only members of a federally recognized Indian tribe because that was the component that made it clear that you were dealing actually with the Indian tribe as a body and the people who constituted that body and not on the basis of race. And then, second, Mancari saw as significant that each of the preferences that it otherwise understood operated on or at least near an Indian reservation because the political preference related to self-government and analogizes -- analogized to a couple of things to individuals who sought to serve a municipal government, to be able to promote the efficient delivery of services, to the territorial requirements of serving an office in the United States Constitution. And so those are the two components Mancari looked at as vital.   ICWA includes neither.   It operates only off of tribal reservations.   It does not require a child who will be subjected to ICWA to be a member of the tribe.

One response that the government has is that the state could just choose not -- could walk away, essentially, and, certainly, private parties have the option to participate or not in termination-of-rights proceedings or seeking foster care placement. How would that work? Could Texas walk away? You know, if you had a child who was a member of a tribe and was in a situation in which the child was in danger or, you know, like the Brackeens' children here, like, you know, YRJ, could Texas choose -- could the Texas agency choose not to intervene or seek a foster care placement for the child?

So I think the fact that that is the -- the sort of component they're offering, aside from I have no idea how as a practical matter Texas could do that, the fact they're saying do it our way or else, I think, is a more in the nature of a confession than an explanation.

Justice Alito says they couldn't -- could they legislate? I don't know that I can see that they couldn't given the plenary power. And I'm also worried about the -- the sort of ahistorical gloss of this because it seems to me that there is ample evidence historically that the design of the Constitution gave the federal government that very power at the expense of the states, that we had had a previous set of circumstances in which the federal government and the state government shared power related to Indian affairs and that the Constitution came along and gave it to the federal government.

"}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " Again, on this two points, the first being Federalist 42 I think holds part of the answer, which my friends on the other side rely on.   Federalist 42 specifically cites the two limitations regarding what was then Article IX of the Articles of Confederation. And then later, when it describes how it's -- it removed itself of I think these -- these \"embarrassments,\" it says, and then, therefore, this whole power will allow regulation of trade.   It uses specifically the word \"trade\" to describe the power that has been unshackled by these two things.   Not even commerce more broadly but trade. So the idea that Federalist 42's understanding of the changes to -- to Article IX of the -- of the Articles of Confederation would have expanded to an -- to an all-encompassing Indian affairs power I think is just in the teeth of that historical evidence. "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " All right.   But, in the actual Constitution, we have commerce and we have historians that have said that at the time commerce meant more than trade.   It included intercourse.   Justice Sotomayor has brought that up several times.   So what do you say in response to that? "}, {"speaker": "Judd E. Stone, II", "text": " The problem is here is the syllogism they're relying on, which is that commerce mean -- can -- can mean trade and intercourse.   Intercourse can mean all relationships in between men and groups of men. Therefore, commerce means all relationships between groups of men. In Gibbons, in Story, in other original sources, intercourse is paired up with -- specifically in Gibbons, with the word \"navigation\" so as to describe what we now would refer to as the channels of commerce, the ability to set rules as to what foreign boats may dock in places. So \"intercourse\" doesn't get Respondents the way to ICWA.   It doesn't even get them beyond what we would ordinarily think of as the Commerce Clause now. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler. "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this Court recognized in Holyfield and Adoptive Couple, ICWA was enacted in response to serious harms caused by widespread child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of Indian families, often unwarranted, through adoption or foster placement, usually in non-Indian homes. Over the more than 40 years since its enactment, ICWA has furnished vital protections against those practices and has become integrated in state child welfare practices. There's no basis for uprooting those practices or for overturning Congress's considered judgment in enacting ICWA. ICWA, in fact, is a valid exercise of Congress's power over Indian affairs in several respects.   That power is grounded in the text of the Constitution, including the Indian Commerce Clause.   It is grounded as well in the constitutional structure in which Indian tribes occupy a unique status as dependent sovereigns to which the United States owes a duty of protection, and that duty of protection, as this Court observed in Kagama, derives in large measure from the fact that the national government and the states aiding it, acting through treaty and war powers, diminished the tribes' ability, put them in a position of dependency, and, as this Court said in Kagama, Seber, and other cases, with -- gave rise to a duty of protection, which in turn encompassed a power of protection. Congress's efforts to address the problems in ICWA, protecting family integrity, kinship, unity, and the integrity and long-term existence of tribes, lie at the core of Congress's power under the plenary powers.   It does so by -- not by displacing state authority but simply imposing minimum standards on states' exercise of that authority by seeing foster care and adoption in -- in state courts. Petitioners' plea to this Court to set aside ICWA on its face would undermine those vital protections that have worked well, as the amicus brief by 23 states shows, since its enactment.   It would also gravely undermine this Court's Indian jurisprudence by carving up Congress's plenary power into discrete categories, which this Court has never recognized.   And it would undermine the reliance of Congress, of tribes, of individual members, and, here, states on Congress's exercise of power. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Congress's power -- and -- and the Holliday decision that was referred to previously, I think, is very instructive on this point in a number of reasons.

It rejected the proposition that just because the Indians there were citizens, that that was beyond what -- what Congress could do.   And it -- and it said that that could be upheld because it was an appropriate exercise of -- of Congress's power. But it also specifically rejected the argument that the -- that Congress can only deal with tribes.   It said tribes are made up of their members, of their constituents. And that's an important thing to understand about the way ICWA operates.   It operates on the basis of citizenship, that the definition of Indian child is that the child must be a member of the tribe or, if not, it has to -- the -- the child has to be eligible for -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And they have that in common.   They -- tribes -- tribes have aligned over the years in common interests.   They have -- Congress certainly thought this was true -- some common cultural ties or practices or spiritual practices.   They -- they may not be dispositive, but it's a recognition that that could be true. The -- the third preference doesn't come up.   In -- in fact, the Petitioners in this case have not identified any case that -- that fits the paradigm that -- that -- that I think Justice Kavanaugh might have been talking about, where you have somebody -- another tribe with no other sort of connection to the child. A tribe is not just going to arbitrarily reach out and grab -- grab a child. They will do it because they have some interest. And it's not a property interest.

The -- the children don't voluntarily join the tribe.   And in my hypothetical where the -- the parents don't want the child to be treated as a member of the -- a member of the tribe, this child is treated as an Indian under ICWA solely based on the child's status as a -- based on ancestry.

It is not an unheard of proposition. And the parallels between Congress's dealing with tribes and Congress's dealing with foreign countries and foreign affairs is -- is very direct for these purposes.   It's dealing with another sovereign. In fact, that parallel is present in the Indian Commerce Clause, which -- which is written in terms of commerce with foreign governments and with states. So there's -- there is -- there is that parallel.   And it's also common where, if the -- if the parents once enrolled the child but didn't want them to be treated as -- as a tribal member, children follow -- children don't make their own decisions.   Someone else does.

The idea that -- that in all of its operations, under Salerno, it would be necessary to say in all of its operations it either exceeds Congress's Article I powers or is a violation of equal protection.   And I think that that is an untenable position. This statute has been operating for 40 years, and we have 23 states who say it is working well.   We have numerous tribes saying it's critical to tribal preservation, and that Congress's judgment 40 years ago remains sound. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

But, if Congress is acting on individual members of tribes in a way that is harmful to them, I don't think that that is rationally related to the fulfillment of Congress's obligations to the tribes. That's -- that -- that's a -- that's a -- a -- a -- I think an important marker that what Congress is doing has to be reasonably understood as promoting the welfare of the -- the individuals involved. I think that's an important limitation.   If -- if the boarding school example were going to arise now, that would be a very serious question.   Maybe a hundred years ago people had a different idea of that. But -- but now it is, I think, uniformly thought to have been harmful, and Congress cannot gratuitously do harmful things to individual -- individual tribal members, just like it -- it can't do anyone else.

I think it's still -- I think it's still a political classification but -- but perhaps an unreasonable one because there -- there -- there is, as the Court's cases that have looked at this, Holliday and others, there -- there is, I think, at some point a proportionality aspect to it.   Would -- would other people in the society be -- be greatly adversely affected or something -- something like that. But, on the equal protection side, I think Adarand is a very good example of that because there was a -- a preference for contracting within a series of Black, Asian, white -- you know, other minority groups.   It -- it was expressed in racial terms, and the Court said that was subject to strict scrutiny.

In response to Justice Alito's questions in particular and some of Justice Kagan's questions as well, you were saying plenary is plenary.   So you would say that Congress's power to regulate Indian affairs is plenary so long as it's rational or, you know, reasonably related or whatever standard we want to use, it's within Congress's power and the only limitation is if it bumps up against some external limit, like the Equal Protection Clause or like sovereign immunity -- "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Justice Jackson? "}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " Yes.   So I -- I agree to some extent with Justice Kavanaugh that there are strong interests on both sides of these issues.   What I'm mostly concerned about is that we might be taking it upon ourselves to weigh those interests where, really, our role should be thinking about what the framers intended with respect to the scope of Congress's authority as it regards Indian affairs and what Congress believed was necessary to protect Indians given that exercise of authority. So I guess I'm -- that makes me wonder whether we shouldn't be giving more weight to the statements in the legislative history from Congress in terms of its decision that ICWA and its provisions were, in fact, related to tribal sovereignty, necessary to preserve tribal sovereignty.   So let me just ask you, how -- how much weight, if any, should we be giving to clear, direct statements from Congress that this was being done pursuant to its understanding of its plenary authority as given it -- given to it in the Constitution and that it was necessary from Congress's perspective to solve for the problem of these state welfare practices that were causing harm to Indian children given its responsibility as a trust relationship for Indian affairs? "}, {"speaker": "Edwin S. Kneedler", "text": " I think very, very great deference, and I think that is the message of cases like Holliday and Perrin and cases like that.   And you don't have to look to legislative history for that.   It's set out in the -- it's set out in the -- in the beginning of ICWA itself. It starts by saying Clause 3 of Article I provides that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with Indians, and through this and other authority it has plenary power.   Congress is saying that, through statutes, treaties, et cetera, and -- and the course of dealing with tribes, it has assumed -- assumed the responsibility for the protection of Indians.   Those are in 1901. 1902 says that Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of this nation to protect the best interests of Indian children by establishing minimum standards in state child welfare proceedings because that was the problem they were addressing. Yes, the boarding school issue was also out there, but Congress saw, again, in the considered, focused way that it deals with problems, it saw a major problem.   It thought that this was in the best interests, that the standards and the protections and the framework it set out were in the best interests of the child. And if that displaces ordinary child welfare law in particular cases, Congress made a judgment that the objective factors it set out, which take into account extended family and kinship principles, that family law has, but the way this statute implements them in state proceedings is in the best interests of Indian children, and that judgment by Congress based on extensive hearings is entitled to great deference. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn. "}, {"speaker": "Ian H. Gershengorn", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted ICWA because Indian children were being torn from their families and tribes through the operation of state family law in state courts.   I want to emphasize three points at the start. First, there is no -- Congress has plenary power over Indians, and there is no exception in that power for state court child custody proceedings.   Since the founding, the health and safety of Indian children has been the province of the federal government and tribes, not the states. And, indeed, when Congress attempted to give states authority over Indian children in the 20th Century, states resisted and said it was an exclusive federal responsibility. Second, Plaintiffs' equal protection claims should be rejected.   A facial challenge in a case without standing is just about the worst way to consider the constitutionality of a major federal statute.   And, in any event, ICWA draws distinctions that are political three times over; it applies only to tribes that the federal government has recognized, it incorporates membership criteria established by sovereign tribes, and it relies on the political decisions of parents to remain tribal members. Third, ICWA protects the best interests of children.   It adopts a system of structured decision-making that combines evidence-based presumptions with flexibility to make individualized determinations.   It protects child safety, facilitates access to critical remedial services to keep families intact, and it keeps -- works to keep family -- keep children with their families and communities. That's why ICWA is viewed as the gold standard. I'd be happy to take the Court's questions.   If not, I will start with -- with the -- I'll take the Court's questions. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Ian H. Gershengorn", "text": " But I'm also happy to keep going.   Sorry, though. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Not that easy. Do you think that ICWA incorporates the familiar best interests of the child inquiry that are -- are applied in family courts throughout the country? "}, {"speaker": "Ian H. Gershengorn", "text": " So I think I'd have to say the answer to that is no.   What ICWA does is modify that because Congress made the judgment that the best interests standard was being applied in a way that resulted in unwarranted removals. What Congress did was create a system it thought was in the best interests of the child but not by adopting the \"state best interests of the child standard\" because it found that that was being applied in a discriminatory way. Now, so, Your Honor, there's been a lot of back and forth about good cause, and it seems like good cause is important in the statute. I will say candidly, having looked at the cases, there are three -- the -- the state courts are in a little bit of disarray as to whether the preferences are sort of binding, whether there's a straight free -- free-floating best interest standard that sort of -- that -- that works through good cause, or whether, as I think is probably the way Congress intended it, that there's a -- the placements are the default setting and good cause provides a -- a way to rebut the presumption. Now Interior has -- has explained how good cause works.   It involves you can take into account the decisions of the -- the views of the parents, the views of the child, if the child is old enough to express them.   You can take into account sibling attachment.   You can take into account bonding with foster parents as long as it was not done illegally through ICWA.   The thing you cannot take into account is socioeconomic status. So what the Casey brief and others say and what -- the reason why medical professionals are here, states are here, family rights advocates are here, is because ICWA is the gold standard.   It adopts that -- those evidence-based presumptions and allows for flexibility to protect the best interests of the child. So, with respect to sort of the power debate which has been going on, I want to make a couple of points.   First, this is at the core of the plenary power doctrine.   From the beginning, the -- the plenary power doctrine was used to protect Indians from non-Indians.   There is no doubt that if states had moved in and done a wholesale physical removal of Indian children, that would have been within the duty of protection.   The fact that this is being done through state courts, through state family law, doesn't deprive Congress of power. Justice Barrett, you were asking about limits.   Obviously, when we're talking about plenary power, limits are hard to find, but I will say this Court has identified some.   What I would say is, when Congress acts directly on Indians, the limits on plenary power, as opposed to the other provisions, are hard to find, but what Congress said in Perrin was that when Congress acts on non-Indians to protect Indians, then there may be limits. And, in that case, it was the question of banning alcohol sales outside of reservations.   And what Congress said -- what the Court said was that if you're doing it in counties where there are a lot of Indians, probably okay.   If you're doing it statewide when Indians are concentrated in a -- a number of counties, not okay.   And so that's a limit that this Court has identified. The limit that does not exist is the one that's tied to land.   I -- I've already addressed the limit for state custody proceedings, which, you know, Congress has acted for servicemen to say deployment is not something you can take into -- it cannot be dispositive in a best interest finding, right. Congress has acted pursuant to other federal powers to do exactly what it did in ICWA. The -- the rule that makes no sense is land.   Why does it make no sense? From the beginning, Congress has -- from the 17 -- from the Trade and Intercourse Act forward, Congress has legislated off-reservation.   It -- it prohibited in the 1834 Act in Section 15 alienating the confidence of Indians.   In the earlier acts, it -- it required non-Indians to report Indian invasions to the federal government.   It prohibited land sales by Indians on and off the reservation.   In the liquor sale context, what this Court said in McGowan was Congress has the authority to legislate wherever Indians may be.   In Holliday, Forty-Three Gallons, Perrin, all those cases are off reservation.   In the treaty cases, this Court has seen in Fishing Vessel, in Cougar Den, right, those were off reservation.   And then Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the Indian Housing -- Native American Housing Assistance Program, the Indian Education Program, all of those are off reservation. Why does land make no sense? Land makes no sense because, in the Articles of Confederation, there was a land carveout.   It was exactly the kind of reason that we had the change in the Constitution to prevent that. Why does land make no sense? There are landless tribes, right? There are landless tribes in California and Montana.   Land is just not a sensible way to divide and limit congressional power. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " What is it based on? "}, {"speaker": "Ian H. Gershengorn", "text": " It is based on the view that -- that -- that all federally recognized -- all federally recognized tribes and members of those tribes share a common political relationship with the United States. That's what renders it political rather than racial.   Every member of a federally recognized tribe shares that political relationship. Now that then begs the question that a number of the Justices have focused on about, is it rational? That's a fair question, and that's a fair debate. Let me explain why I think it clearly is rational.   And some of this Mr. Kneedler touched on and I agree with.   It has a clearly -- remember, we're talking about a -- a preference -- a prong that was never applied to any of the -- of the plaintiffs here.   And on a facial challenge, right? All I -- all it has to have is a plainly legitimate scope, which it does. In Alaska, for example, it is quite common for Indian members of one tribe to live on the reservation of another.   The preference applies quite often there, right? What the -- what your Court -- what the Court has been worrying about is this kind of Maine to Arizona hypo, right, that we identify some tribe in Maine that's going to somehow get a preference. Well, that case has never happened that we have been able to find and able counsel on the other side has been able to find, and I would submit on a facial challenge in a situation where it's never applied that would be very odd to strike down a congressional statute. I will say, though, that I -- for the reasons I've said, I think it's -- it is actually quite rational.   If the Court disagreed, it's also clearly severable.   If I give a -- if I say I would like, you know, Italian food, Chinese food, and any steak joint, and it turns out there's a vegan in the group, that I can't do the steak joint, the first two preferences remain, okay? There's no -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But why is it rational? I understand that it's a facial challenge, but why -- why is it rational? Before the arrival of Europeans, the tribes were at war with each other often, and they were separated by an entire continent.   And I -- I don't know how many cultural similarities you would identify if you compared a tribe in Florida with a tribe in Alaska. "}, {"speaker": "Ian H. Gershengorn", "text": " So, Your Honor, I think it's been pretty clear I am not basing this on cultural similarity.   I'm basing it on a political relationship with the United States that all the tribes share. Now I take Your Honor's point.   If we had a case -- and this is why you wait for -- for actual -- for actual as-applied challenges as opposed to facial challenges.   If we had a case where a family was denied because a tribe in Maine with no ties to the child was given preference over a Cherokee or a Navajo Indian, we would be talking about a pretty serious -- a pretty serious as-applied challenge. But, of course, we're -- we're a million miles from that.   We're the exact opposite.   What you're hearing and what the -- what is actually happening on the ground is this is used in situations which are quite unremarkable, as I say, when a member of one tribe is living on the reservation of another, has built exactly the kind of community that ICWA is hoping to preserve. So, you know, from -- from my perspective, I certainly am not here to defend the -- the what I'll call the Maine to Arizona hypo.   But I -- what I am here to say is it has a plainly legitimate sweep; it is political, not racial; and that -- that -- that even if Your Honors disagree with that, it's also plainly severable.

Mancari says you can't just give a preference to any Indian, even a federally -- a member of a federally recognized tribe, throughout the government.   A bare desire to -- to help is not enough.

It has -- the reason -- justification has to be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress's unique obligations to the Indians. Some of those, you know, Mancari said BIA, okay; federal government-wide, not okay. And, you know, then I need to see what Congress said.   What makes this case so easy, right, is Congress studied this for four years, right? Congress told you exactly why, not in legislative history, but in legislative findings that it said this is what we're worried about, right?

Congress found that ICWA was in the best interests of the children, right? I -- I don't think I could emphasize it more than -- than that.   What Congress found was that it was -- it was in the interests of the children.   And the reason that Congress found that is because -- and the reason ICWA has become the gold standard is because Congress made the judgment and recognized that separating children from their families and communities too soon caused harm. I -- I think it's important to recognize that the average age of people in ICWA is over six years old.   This is discussed in the Casey brief.   These are children who have formed school mates, school bond.   They are children who are playing on sports teams.   They are children who have interacted, have a group of friends.   They've been -- made connections on the community. And what ICWA realizes is that these children were being taken from their communities too soon.   Why? Well, sometimes there was abuse at home, right? But what ICWA says is a lot of times that is remediateable, which is why we have the active efforts provision, right? It's substance abuse, right? It's -- it's the ability, if you can get the child out of the home, get the care to the parents, then the child will actually thrive when the child is returned to the home and community.

"}, {"speaker": "Ian H. Gershengorn", "text": " Your Honor, thank you.   So they don't have standing for a number of reasons.   First, redressability, right? This is a law review article.   It does not bind a single state court judge that actually adjudicates a -- a -- a -- a -- a state court adoption proceeding. Second, there is no injury-in-fact. There is not a single individual plaintiff who has had an adoption that existed from the time of the amended complaint through the Fifth Circuit judgment.   And so there is no injury-in-fact. And, third, there has been some suggestion that the APA, the challenge to the APA, regs under the APA might save the equal protection challenge.   That is incorrect. The injury to the Plaintiffs is coming from the preferences in the statute.   There is nothing about the challenge to the regs that eliminates the preferences in the statute or the definition of Indian child.   And so there is no standing on the equal protection side for -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Does it -- does it make a difference that our ruling would bind state officials? "}, {"speaker": "Ian H. Gershengorn", "text": " Absolutely not, Your Honor.   The -- the Court has been crystal clear that standing needs -- that standing needs to be established in the lower court. Every case would have standing.   There would be no advisory opinions because, of course, what this Court says binds everybody. And so the fact that -- that it's made it this far through an erroneous standing ruling does not cure the -- the standing problem that existed at the start. And then I will say, although Your Honor asked me about individuals, Texas has no equal protection rights here.   Texas goes on and on, we heard all the numbers this morning, about their injury.   That's nice, but injury does not create an equal protection right. And, basically, what -- what Texas's view would do is completely eviscerate third-party standing.   Georgia v. McCollum could have been a very short opinion.   It could have just said Texas is participating in an unconstitutional scheme, thank you very much, but it didn't to that.   It looked to see whether there were third-party rights that Georgia could assert that for some reason the third party was unlikely to assert. And -- but regardless of whether teenage drinkers or excluded jurors have a disincentive to -- to bring court cases, that has no application to the situation here, where individual plaintiffs are in court litigating. So there is no justification for Texas to assert rights.   And, obviously, the parens patriae is not available against the federal government.   So there is no standing, in addition to the fact that the preferences that have most troubled, for example, Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Barrett, they were never applied to any -- like, it's like standing on standing on standing problems.   It's like an inverse of turtles all the way down.   It's like the absence of turtles anywhere. I need a better metaphor. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

First of all, the main point from our perspective is that -- and this is at Footnote 44 of -- Footnote 54 on page 85 of our brief -- is that it applies even -- evenhandedly to -- this does not single out Texas or does not single out states for particular treatment.   It applies just as much in private placements, and that's set forth in the brief. I also think that it is -- it is right to view this as a situation in which a private right is created.   You have the -- the -- the individual Indian child.   The -- the tribe has a right to -- you know, to -- to have the placement done only after active efforts are -- you know, active efforts are done. And so I -- I think that with respect to the active efforts provisions, under this Court's case law, a provision that applies even-handedly to private parties and to states and creates private rights is -- is not commandeering -- not impermissible commandeering.

If this Court is going to evaluate even-handed restrictions to see whether, on balance, they affect more states than private parties, we've really extended the -- you know, the anti-commandeering doctrine and I think the -- this Court's caseload quite substantially because, you know, what the -- you know, it's one thing to say -- you know, not to mention cases like Reno v. Condon.   I mean, once you start to say, yes, it regulates even-handedly, yes, in the real world, there are private and state parties at issue, but we're going to look to it and say it more often affects, you know, states -- and I think Reno v. Condon is sort of against that.   I think that was one where the state may have been more affected.

"}, {"speaker": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "text": " -- that's being brought here? "}, {"speaker": "Ian H. Gershengorn", "text": " I think it comes in -- in two important ways.   First of all, I think it completely changes the standard of review that this Court -- that this Court uses.   What the Court has said in facial challenges is statutes -- congressional statutes survive if they have a plainly legitimate scope.   And so I think that, like, it completely changes the way we talk about, for example, the -- the third -- the third preference. And, you know, then I think, on the flip side, in addition to sort of the change in legal standard, it changes how we talk about it. What we are talking about here is a series of hypotheticals.   Honestly, we don't even have the facts of the individual cases before us. Remember, these are childcare proceedings.   I mean, there's a debate about -- about Child P, and then there's an amicus brief from the grandmother.   They're -- they're presenting starkly different views of what happened. The reason we're doing this is because we're here on facial challenge, right? How this plays out in the real world, what the limits are, this is a very, very difficult area of the law, as the last two, three hours have shown. And -- and to decide it on the basis of hypotheticals that never arise in the real world and yet take away a statute that has made such a meaningful difference for so many children seems to me just like not the way this Court should be deciding questions. Go back to what I said at the start. Deciding a facial challenge to a statute in a situation where there is no standing seems to me like a very poor way to resolve major challenges to critical legislation. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. McGILL "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.   I will take the hint. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Matthew D. McGill", "text": " I -- I -- I want to start with how this works in practice.   I assure you it is not at all hypothetical.   It starts with the Brackeens and families like them being on a list of willing foster care providers. Joint Appendix 108 says we are willing to be foster parents for other children in the future.   When a child comes into the foster care system, the preferences are applied.   That's 1915(b).   The final rule is applied.   The good cause requirement to the final rule is applied. And it is applied each and every time an Indian child comes into the system. This is not like Halley's Comet.   It comes around a lot.   In Texas alone, in -- in Footnote 4 of the district court opinion, 39 children, Indian children in -- in the state foster care system.   Joint Appendix 108, Texas alleges this happens several times a year. How does the good cause get -- requirement get applied on the ground? I would ask the Court to please look at the -- the court of appeals decision in YRJ's case called Interest of YRJ.   It says that in -- seeking to establish good cause for not following the placement preferences, the -- the party must bring forth by clear and convincing evidence of -- of good cause, that good cause must be based on at least one of several considerations. My friend on the other side says this is a disarray in the state courts.   I would respectfully suggest it is regulatory design. The government, in any event, has conceded that this is intended to override the normal application of the best interest tests. We heard a little bit about the third preference.   The government suggests that it applies to maybe only related tribes.   We know why it applies.   It's in this Court's decision in Holyfield. There is a federal policy to send Indian children to the Indian community, not their community, as the government seeks to alter it in the brief, the Indian -- Indian community writ large. We heard that the proprietary interest is maybe just a duty of protection.   I would submit YRJ was a citizen of Texas before she was given her -- her certificate of Indian blood. Texas has at least as much proprietary interest as the Navajo Nation does here. The third preference and the biological component of the Indian child definition is the smoking gun textual evidence here that Congress was acting with a racial purpose. And it's backstopped by the House report, which talks about identifying children who have common blood.   It says that blood relationship is the very touchstone of the ability to remain, to enjoy the benefits of a tribe. The government here is making, in fact, the same argument it made in Rice on the equal protection point.   You can see that from Justice Ginsburg's one-paragraph dissent.   But there's one notable exception. In Rice, at oral argument, the government was prepared to -- to concede that these preferences could not be applied in the outer world.   It -- and it recognized that this distinction was rooted in Mancari itself. So that's why Rice concludes that the administration of state laws by a state agency is that outer world.   It's the new and larger dimension to which Mancari could not possibly be applied.   That -- the government here is even broader than it made in Rice.   And it can't be squared with Rice's holding that a tribal classification can be a proxy for race. The classification was political in Mancari because it directly advanced tribes' ability to govern themselves.   The Justice and Treasury hypotheticals, Justice Kavanaugh, present more difficult questions, it was conceded, because the tie to self-governance in those cases is -- is much more attenuated. Rice held that the Hawaii statute's advancement of indigenous self-government was insufficient to make that classification political because it operated in the sphere of administration of state laws by a state agency. ICWA has no connection to tribal government at all.   Whether YRJ is adopted by the Brackeens will not affect one iota the Navajo Nation's ability to pass its own laws or to govern themselves.   It doesn't apply on Indian lands at all.   It doesn't even affect tribal existence.   She is already a member of the Navajo Nation and will remain so. YRJ is subjected to a different legal standard here based on a status that she has zero ability to control.   That differing legal standard, the placement preferences, is at best a set of stereotypes about what is best for the child that's -- that has Indian ancestry. "}, {"speaker": "John G.
