[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 17-988, Lamps Plus versus Varela. Mr. Pincus. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly recognized that the changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class action arbitration are fundamental. The question in this case is what standard a court should apply in determining whether an arbitration agreement authorizes class arbitration. As a threshold matter, we think it's clear that federal law imposes a minimum standard that must be satisfied in order to permit class arbitration.   The Court made that clear in Stolt-Nielsen, where it said a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But don't you make that determination under state law? I didn't think the FAA in any way undoes state law, unless the basis of the state law is directed only at arbitration, which isn't the case here. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I don't think that's correct, Your Honor.   The clear and unmistakable standard that was being discussed in the last case is a -- is a standard that the FAA imposes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Well, that's a standard that's basically dicta because there the parties agree the agreement didn't.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " No, but -- but in First Options, where the Court adopted that standard, the Court said that it was the FAA that imposes the clear and unmistakable requirement before the -- before an arbitration agreement may be construed to delegate gateway issues to the arbitrator. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I do have one more question for me.   You claim there's jurisdiction for you to appeal this case. Let's assume the plaintiff or the Petitioner, or I guess it would be the Respondent here -- either way, that a party who seeks class arbitration is denied class arbitration.   Can they appeal directly to us? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " If -- if the case is in the same posture as this one where the district court dismissed the action, then -- then the -- the provision that we rely on, Section 16(a)(3), would provide for an appeal. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what's good for the goose is good for the gander? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Absolutely, Your Honor. And that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So we're going to be filled with all of these interim orders denying or granting class arbitration, as the case may be, because each losing party will have the opportunity to come to us and the arbitration won't proceed? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, it's not just class arbitration.   Today, in the lower courts, when a lower court dismisses a case and grants arbitration -- in favor of an order granting arbitration, those -- those cases are immediately appealable in courts like the Ninth Circuit.   And there are many, many appeals pending right now in the Ninth Circuit on that basis. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " The courts aren't staying those cases? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Excuse me? "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " They haven't -- "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Some courts stay them and some courts don't, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why? I mean, throughout -- again, throughout law, there's always a fight between making interlocutory matters immediately appealable, which, if you do, will often save a lot of money, and waiting until the end.   And the normal decision here is wait until the end.   And then there are exceptions, mandamus and certifying a question. When we read the statute, it says what the district court shall do if he is satisfied that this is arbitrable, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until the arbitration has been had. This judge didn't do it, and you didn't -- your predecessor didn't ask him to do it.   So this seems like a fluke.   But, if we were to say these are appealable, it's not only contrary to a very basic principle of -- of how to run courts, but it's also, because of that, going to have just the effect Justice Sotomayor said. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, a couple of answers, Your Honor.   This case is in the exact same posture as Randolph, where the Court made the initial decision that 16(a)(3), coupled with a dismissal, provides for an immediate appeal. The Court in Randolph noted that there was a question about the question that Your Honor raises, whether it's proper for a district court to issue a stay or to dismiss the case, and said that didn't -- that wasn't briefed, it wasn't a question before the court, it wasn't going to decide it.   This case is in -- in the same posture. It may be that the Court should take a case to decide the question whether district courts have the power to dismiss rather than stay, but the issue is not presented here and hasn't been briefed here. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " May I ask, Mr. Pincus, if you could go back to the -- the substantive argument? So, in -- in a strange kind of way, it occurred to me, as Mr. Geyser was speaking, your position is very similar to Mr. Geyser's. You both have these very broad -- this very broad contractual language, right? He had a broad delegation clause, and you have contractual language that refers to all disputes, claims, or controversies in lieu of any and all suits or other civil legal proceedings. And -- and what I hear you to be saying is essentially that you want to say except for class suits.   Is that right? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I don't think so, Your Honor.   I -- I think what -- what -- what this case brings before the Court, as I said, is the question that Stolt-Nielsen didn't address. What Stolt-Nielsen said was silence isn't enough -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I -- I'm just thinking as a -- as a matter first of -- of just contract law, because he said what we have here is we can't really believe that the parties agreed to include a certain set of things.   And -- and I hear you to be saying the same thing.   We can't really believe that the parties agreed to be speaking of class claims. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I think the contractual language here is actually quite clear.   The -- the language you quote -- that Your Honor quoted is language about what can't be done. There's a provision, and it appears on pages 24a to 25a of the petition appendix, that's captioned -- that's headed Claims Covered by the arbitration provision.   And it says, \"The company and I mutually consent to the resolution of all claims or controversies, past, present, or future, that I may have against the company or against its officers\" -- and I'll skip some language, blah, blah, blah -- \"or that the company may have against me.   Specifically, the company and I mutually consent to the resolution by arbitration of all claims that may hereafter arise in connection with my employment or any of the parties' rights or obligations arising under this agreement.\" So we think the agreement is actually quite clear.   And this isn't a case where we're asking -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, it seems to me, I mean, there's -- there's language that's in favor of each side's position.   The \"all disputes, claims, or controversies,\" \"all suits or other legal proceedings\" goes against you. You would suggest that \"I, me, and my\" cuts for you. You know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not quite sure that that's the case, but -- you know, because it's an agreement between these two parties about suits, and the question is, what kind of suits is it about and whether there's a kind of implicit exception for class claims in suits. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I don't think it's about an implicit concept -- exception, Your Honor. In Stolt-Nielsen, the Court said we can't presume from a -- an arbitration -- the fact of an arbitration agreement that the parties have agreed to class arbitration because of the fundamental differences.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Yes, but in -- in Stolt-Nielsen, there was no contract.   There was no agreement.   And, you know, everybody understood there was a stipulation to the effect that there was no agreement on this issue and -- and -- and instead there was just a -- a policy determination. But, here, there is a contract.   And the question is, what does the contract mean? Does it mean all disputes, claims, or controversies? Or does it mean all disputes, claims, or controversies, except class disputes, claims, and controversies because we really think that not -- that the party would not -- that the party who drafted the contract would not have agreed to that? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, I -- I guess I'll -- there are a couple of questions embodied in your question, I think.   I -- I think -- Stolt-Nielsen, there was an agreement.   The parties agreed that the agreement didn't speak to the question of class arbitration. We think this agreement too doesn't speak to the question of class arbitration. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, we would never say -- "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " But -- but -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- that in general.   A general clause usually speaks to the things inside it.   If I say all furniture, it usually means tables and chairs.   If I say all clothing, it usually means pants and shirts. And we don't insist that everybody lay out all the subcategories of things. So this question is here you have an overall, you know, term, \"disputes, claims, or controversies.\" Why wouldn't you include class disputes, claims, or controversies, unless there's some kind of special contractual interpretive rule coming in that we wouldn't apply in other contexts? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, we think Stolt-Nielsen said that there is a special contractual rule and that there are -- there are two possibilities there. We think the most sensible rule is to apply the clear and unmistakable standard because of the fundamental change that arises from class arbitration to -- from bilateral arbitration to class arbitration. One of the -- one -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Now we're creating a federal common law -- "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- something we're loathe to do in virtually every other context? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, just -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I think we were very clear that it's a matter of contract and state law controls that. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I -- I think the Court has not been clear, Your Honor.   Again, First Options specifically says that, although contractual interpretation is generally a question of state law, in this context, the court created, based on the FAA, a special interpretive rule that said -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's really interesting. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " -- clear -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Where does the FAA give us that right? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " The Court many years ago in Moses Cone said there was another contractual rule, which says that close questions about arbitrability should go to arbitrability because of the policy embodied in the FAA. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Look, I want you to finish that.   Are you finished? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, I was just going to respond to Justice Sotomayor's question about where the -- where that comes from in the FAA. And I think it comes from Section 4 of the FAA.   What the Court has said and what the Court said both in First Options and in Stolt-Nielsen where the Court made this exact same point about the general rule being federal -- being state law, but there being an FAA overlay, is that it comes from the requirement in Section 4 that the parties be directed to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement. And I think in both contexts what the Court has said is that this is to find -- to be sure that it is the terms of the agreement in this special case. In the -- in the case addressed by First Options, the gateway issues, the concern is this is a delegation of very broad power to the arbitrator, and, therefore, there should be certainty that the parties are delegating that power to the arbitrator. Here, again, delegation of extraordinarily broad power to the arbitrator, as this Court has discussed in a number of opinions about class arbitration, therefore, we think the same test should apply. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So is your -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " No, you go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Is your position that the decision below was right on state law? Basically, you're not quarrelling that this contract was ambiguous, that it was susceptible to the meaning Petitioner -- that Respondent gave it, and that under California law, that would encompass this claim because they weren't the drafters? Is your position now that federal common law is superseding state law -- "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, I -- I think our position -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- on how to interpret a contract? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " -- I think our position has consistently been that our principal argument is that there is a federal rule that Stolt-Nielsen identified -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I asked you a different question. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " And our position on -- on California law is we think that the lower court did wrongly apply California law and applied it in a way to reach a result, and -- and we point to the two California court of appeals -- court of appeal decisions. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay.   But if I got you right, your said your principal position is that there's a federal rule that would come in even if the California courts got California law right, and that in many cases analogous to this, you would have read this contract to include both class claims and individual claims. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " It's really a federal rule that you're asking for. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " We -- we are advocating a federal rule.   I -- I would say that if the Court looks at the cases cited in our petition, there's no court applying -- looking at the issue de novo rather than at an arbitrator's decision that has construed language like this to encompass class arbitration. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   You know, I guess I gave you a bunch of reasons why, in looking at a normal contract, under normal contractual principles, you might think that all this extremely general language included everything inside it.   But you're saying, no, even if you think that, there's a federal law that comes into play. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Just -- just, Your Honor, as in the case of the question of whether a contract delegates arbitrability to the arbitrator.   If the state -- relevant state law would construe the clause to delegate -- would construe the contract to make that delegation, what First Options says is, no, that's not enough. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Right.   I'm not -- "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " We have to have clear and unmistakable language. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I'm just trying to get a handle on what you're saying. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " So -- so you're saying it's a federal rule.   So I guess my question is, where does the federal rule come from? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I think it comes from exactly the same place as the First Options rule and -- and from the discussion of this very issue in Stolt-Nielsen.   It's -- it's constructive to look at Stolt-Nielsen. I -- I understand, Your Honor, that -- that -- that Stolt-Nielsen didn't decide the content of the standard, but Stolt-Nielsen talked about the fact that interpretation of an arbitration agreement is generally a matter of state law, and went on to talk about the fact that the critical question in the FAA is that contracts be interpreted according to their terms, pointing to the language in Section 4, and it concluded, it said, from these principles it follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding the party agreed to do so.   It didn't -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Quite right.   So Stolt-Nielsen said -- but Stolt-Nielsen was a case where there clearly -- where the Court specifically said there was no intent of the parties, there was no agreement as to the particular issue in front of it. So, in my hypothetical where the -- the -- the court is saying: Well, under state law, we would interpret this to understand that there was an intent of the parties and that there was an agreement as to this question, you're saying, notwithstanding that Stolt-Nielsen said that we didn't decide that question, that a federal rule comes into play. And I guess I'm going to ask the same question because I don't think it comes from Stolt-Nielsen, where there was no agreement at all.   So where does the federal rule come from? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I think it comes from the same place that the Moses Cone presumption comes from and the First Options presumption, the rule of clear and unmistakability comes from, and the Howsam rule of clear and unmistakable requirement comes from, which is Section 4. What the Court has said is, with respect to some critical questions, it wants -- there is a federal rule of decision that comes from Section 4 to make certain that the authority delegated to the arbitrator has, in fact, been delegated. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " You're -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " See, I thought -- go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Please. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " You're saying if -- even if it's a questionable interpretation of that statutory language, again, similar to the last case with Justice Kagan's question, the precedent, the ship has sailed? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, I think the ship has certainly sailed -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " In Stolt-Nielsen -- in Stolt-Nielsen, at least you're saying the ship's a long way -- a long way off -- "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I think -- I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " -- because -- because Stolt-Nielsen said that you needed something on the order of express language or indicated or hinted at least is what you're saying here? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I think it's impossible to read the discussion on Stolt-Nielsen on pages 681 to 685 and conclude anything other than the fact that the court concluded there that there was a federal rule of interpretation that it didn't have to flesh -- it said at Footnote 10, in fact, we don't have to decide what that standard is because -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Because the only federal rule was that it needed to be based on an agreement of the parties, because it said arbitration is a matter of consent, and that's all over the Arbitration Act. But the question of how to understand whether parties have consented, that's usually a question of state law. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Except -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And you are saying a federal rule should come in and say, notwithstanding state law saying that these two parties have agreed to something, the federal rule under the Arbitration Act says no. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And usually what the Federal Arbitration Act does is it -- it surely does come into play when you're afraid that the state law is discriminating against arbitration agreements. But where there is no such concern -- and I don't think that there is such a concern if the state -- if the state courts just say we're going to treat general language as including everything inside it -- then I don't see where the federal law comes into play to create a different contract interpretive rule. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, First Options and Howsam were not concerned with discrimination. They were concerned with being certain that when significant power is being assigned to the arbitrator, that the -- that there be clear and unmistakable indication that that was the parties' intent. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " How can that -- how can there be clear and unmistakable here? Let's take Concepcion, where the concern was that these arbitration agreements supposedly based on consent were adhesion contracts, and Concepcion said the court -- the court said that the states remain free to take steps addressing concerns attending adhesion contracts.   One such step would be to require that the class action waiver provision in adhesion agreements be highlighted.   But here we don't even have a waiver provision. So Concepcion suggests waiver should be highlighted so the party subjected to it will understand that.   And here you're asking us to declare clear -- clear and certain, a provision that doesn't say class action -- we waive class actions. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, this -- this might be a different case if the question were whether class actions are excluded from the agreement.   And my friends haven't argued that. This -- the -- the question here is whether this extraordinary procedure called class arbitration is going to be authorized. And -- and so I think there the question where we're talking about whether to delegate that power to the arbitrator does raise exactly the same concerns that motivated the Court in these -- in these other contexts. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Can -- can I go back for a second to the procedural problem? You -- you're plaintiff and you bring a case, and you say, Judge, I want you to send this to arbitration, right? And the other side says, no, Judge, we want you to decide the issue. That's a normal case.   And many, many cases like that will have difficult issues, like the one before us. And so Section 3 of the arbitration agreement seems to say what the judge is supposed to do.   Judge, if you think -- stay the trial, send it to arbitration, if you think that's the result.   By the way, Judge, if you think there's a tough issue in this case, you can always certify it.   And if one of the parties thinks there's a tough issue and you won't certify it, they can always ask for mandamus.   That's like a million cases.   And this is one of them. So, if the judge makes a mistake and writes the word \"dismissal\" or if one of the parties would really like to appeal even though the judge has no reason for it, they can say, Judge, write \"dismiss\"; and then he writes \"dismiss\" and then suddenly it becomes appealable? I mean, you say, well, that's never been decided.   I'd say, all right, but that's a threshold issue; maybe then we should DIG the case. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, the -- the Court did decide the issue in Randolph.   And -- and Randolph was in the same posture here, where there was an order -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, maybe we got it wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " -- on arbitration. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Maybe it wasn't fully argued and -- "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " -- and then I just don't see why we should treat this area of the law when here, unlike the other areas, there is Section 3. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Your Honor -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why should we treat it differently and suddenly reach a tough issue when the statute seems to say don't? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, a couple of -- a couple of answers.   I -- I think it's important for the Court to reach the issue here because the reality is, if a case is sent to class arbitration, it almost certainly is going to settle. The Court has talked a lot about the coercive -- the -- the -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's true. "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " -- inexorable pressure to settle in courts in class litigation.   Class litigation in arbitration is 100 times worse because of the very limited standard of review at the other end. So the reality is, if all cases were stayed and the case could never be appealed at this stage, the question of what the standard is for deciding whether a contract authorizing class arbitration is would never be decided. There is a conflict right now in the courts of appeals about whether dismissal is a permissible -- is a permissible step after a court has ordered arbitration or whether a stay is only permissible. The Court could certainly grant one of those petitions and decide it.   The -- the irony -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But if that -- if that were -- were the case, that the district court has no authority to dismiss, must simply stay the case in court, would you agree that that is not a final judgment, there's no appeal? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " Well, the Court addressed this question in Randolph, which, as I say, was in this posture, and said that the fact that -- the -- the question whether the district court had the power to dismiss, A, was not before it and did not preclude it from hearing the case. I think if the -- if this Court were to hold that a stay was -- was the only permissible option, then, obviously, there wouldn't be an appeal.   But, as I say, there are many, many cases in which dismissals are ordered and which there are appeals.   And the irony of this case, frankly, is the shoes are on the other foot. Typically, what happens is arbitration is ordered, especially in the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs seek dismissal so they can immediately appeal the arbitration order.   And in the Ninth Circuit, that's permissible.   And, typically, defendants resist that. So that's just a -- an issue that is -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " In how many of those cases -- in how many of those cases is -- in this case, the Respondents did not ask for a stay, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " True. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " And so the statute seems permissive.   It says if a party asks for a stay.   But there wasn't a request for one, correct? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I believe that's right.

Vercoski", "text": " Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, were the court within the appellate jurisdiction and thus properly before this Court, this Court should rule that the FAA does not preempt the application of neutral state contract principles to determine whether an arbitration agreement permits arbitration here. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, the question really is whether they're neutral principles.   As I understand it, the -- the argument is that applying these principles has a peculiar impact on arbitration agreements since it authorizes a type of arbitration that is -- is like a poison pill that basically said in prior cases is fundamentally inconsistent with arbitration. "}, {"speaker": "Michele M. Vercoski", "text": " Right.   But they have said in -- in -- in espousing the -- the policy rule that the default might be bilateral arbitration.   But what gives precedence to that is, first and foremost, we have to construe the contract and give intent to the parties.   And that is consistent with the FAA. And a class arbitration, as to whether or not that applies in a class arbitration agreement, is not the same as the issue of arbitrability and doesn't rise to a special standard.   So what's left is just the application of contract principles to determine the parties' intent as to what they applied with class arbitration.

Vercoski", "text": " If that is the case, Your Honor, and it is clear and explicit that there is a class action waiver, then, yes, the parties' intent has to rule out under contract rules.

So, at first, with our agreement here, the court, the district court just found that the agreement provides for a class arbitration and -- and goes to the arbitrator to determine whether or not that will ultimately be certified. So the antecedent question of the court finding that the agreement here provides language that encompasses and anticipates and allows the parties to go forward with arbitration, which will now go to the arbitrator to decide, and they are subject to the same exact rules as a court of law when determining whether or not they're going to certify that class.

And at that point, an absent class member will have the opportunity to opt out.   Or they can limit it to an opt-in proceeding.   And at the end of the day, the -- when the arbitrator does make that decision, there is a review process. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Now the -- the arbitrator might get that issue and decide it doesn't meet the threshold.   There is no way to certify the class.   So then we're back to individual arbitration. So that's why this is a very premature question.   And due process concerns are not related to the antecedent question as to whether or not construing this particular arbitration agreement by the court, all she's saying is not ultimately that it is certifiable.   She's just saying that it is -- the contract does support that the issue of whether or not the class can be certified goes to the arbitrator for ultimate decision.

So I would have a basis for that. Unlike Lamps Plus, they could not turn a non-appealable issue all the way into an appealable issue because they're the ones who asked the court to order the -- the dismissal of my client's claims. Initially, they did it with prejudice below, and they got it without prejudice.   And if that were a stay instead like, arguably, the FAA requires under Section 3, that if you are ordering the claims to proceed to -- to arbitration, it should -- actually, the language says it \"shall\" issue a stay instead of a dismissal without prejudice.

They said that there was an agreement, a side agreement between the parties that expressly stated that we have no agreement on class arbitration. So we're not even going to look at the contract.

You did have some discovery rules here, but by nature, the discovery rules in arbitration, a procedural issue, are different than a lawsuit.   So are notice requirements and interrogatories.

I'm thinking that to the extent that the parties have it in their contract, we have to give their intent, first and foremost, the -- the equal -- we have to enforce it under the FAA. That's their overarching principle, is that we look at the intent and we enforce the contracts according to their intent. So those two lower state contract interpretations, they didn't find ambiguity at all.   The language there was much more limiting into the individual claims that were able to be brought by that individual only with respect to his employment against his employer and vice versa. Our phrases are far more sweeping where Mr. Varela assented to \"waiver of any right I may have to file\" a legal -- \"a lawsuit or civil legal proceeding relating to my employment with the company.\" Relating to my employment, the data breach, but for his employment, the data breach wouldn't have occurred. To the extent he has claims out of the data breach, that encompasses claims of -- of other workers that were subject to the same set of circumstances.

The operative question here is, is he entitled to that in an arbitration? "}, {"speaker": "Michele M. Vercoski", "text": " He absolutely is. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " That's a separate -- "}, {"speaker": "Michele M. Vercoski", "text": " Because the word \"proceeding\" is extremely broad and it includes legal actions or procedures.   A civil arbitration or a class action is absolutely a proceeding. And not only that, controversies, disputes, a class action is a controversy or a dispute.   And anything that was supposed to be brought in a court of law that could have been brought now has to be brought in arbitration. And it doesn't say that those claims cannot be or that they are waived from -- from being brought in arbitration. And the fact that it's -- you know, the -- Lamps Plus argues that there is bilateral language that I, me, my employment, that doesn't -- it doesn't modify the term \"my individual employment\" or my \"individual claims.\" \"My employment\" encompasses all kinds of different claims that arise out of this employment, including the data breach. And because whatever Mr. Varela could bring in a court of law individually, he is entitled to also bring those claims on a class-wide basis in arbitration, because \"in lieu of\" means a set of actions that could have been brought in a court of law, now have to be brought into arbitration. And that does not limit his right to bringing the proceedings on an aggregate basis. That doesn't change the nature of the claims or the parties' rights.   The only thing it changes is the way that the proceedings are processed in arbitration. And it doesn't stop there.   The language goes even broader to encompass all remedies that could have been issued in a court of law. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Class action is not a remedy.

Is there anything else you'd like to add to how you would distinguish Stolt-Nielsen? "}, {"speaker": "Michele M. Vercoski", "text": " Absolutely.   We are on all fours with Stolt-Nielsen because what Stolt-Nielsen said expressly was what we need is a contractual basis in order to find that the parties intended to proceed on the class arbitration basis.

And if we look at Oxford Health, the -- the arbitrator there was permitted to construe the -- to construe the arbitration agreement just by looking at the contract language. And although on review they had to give him deference, they -- they stated that they might not have agreed with his interpretation, but if we were going to go with a clear and unmistakable new policy that Lamps Plus wants this Court to adopt, then Stolt-Nielsen -- sorry, Oxford Health would have been completely erroneous.

There are a number of decisions, hundreds of decisions reported on the AAA website.   There are only eight that are decisions that go to the merits. Five approved settlements.   One is a dismissal.   One is in favor of the defendant. And there's one for the plaintiff.   So they really, for -- for all the years that class arbitrations have been in process, they really haven't produced a lot at the end of the line. Justice Gorsuch raised the due process issue, and I think that's another reason why the clear and unmistakable standard makes sense.   There's a serious risk that if the standard applied below were allowed to -- to prevail, then the class arbitration would proceed. Let's say the defendant won.   Then every class member would then argue in the future, when the defendant sought to enforce that judgment, I didn't agree to class arbitration, so I'm not bound by that judgment. A clear and unmistakable -- and certainly -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Wouldn't they be bound if they got notice and an opportunity to opt out? "}, {"speaker": "Andrew J. Pincus", "text": " I think there are serious questions that were pointed out by Justice Alito in -- in his Oxford Health dissent about whether an arbitration to which they didn't consent could bind them, especially if they could prevail on an argument that the arbitration agreement did not provide for class arbitration. That would be their argument.   And, ironically, the defendant would then be arguing for class arbitration.   The -- the class -- a putative class member would say no, and the putative class member would say you should construe the ambiguous agreement against me by saying there's no -- there's no arbitration. So that's another reason why we think the clear and unmistakable standard makes sense. Justice Gorsuch, you asked about whether the arbitrator would be bound by the district court's decision.   The arbitrator's bound under Rule 1(c) of the AAA rules by the decision that the arbitration agreement authorizes class arbitration. Obviously, the arbitrator then would have to go through the process to see whether the rules for certifying a class were met, but he couldn't or she couldn't contradict the court's determination that class arbitration was authorized. And -- and then just -- my friend relies -- places a lot of reliance on the \"in lieu of\" sentence in the agreement, but what that says is what arbitration is instead of. It doesn't say what can be arbitrated. And what can be arbitrated is covered by the claims covered by the arbitration provision, and that's the provision that has the I's and the my's. Unless the Court has any further questions. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
