[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument this morning in Case 14-981, Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin. Before we get started, I'll advise the lawyers that this is our only case this morning, so we intend to grant the parties ten minutes or so of extra time and the amicus five minutes. So Mr. Rein, no need to rush. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I appreciate the extra time, and I didn't rush up here to start before you invited me this time. In reviewing the Fifth Circuit's initial decision in what we call Fisher I, seven members of this Court reaffirmed that a clear precondition to the use of race as an admissions factor was the ability to satisfy what was called the \"demanding burden of strict scrutiny\" articulated in Grutter and Bakke. By establishing that she was considered for admission to UT under a system that discriminated against her on the basis of her race, Ms. Fisher placed upon UT the burden of -- of proving, by evidence of record, that its use of race was, first, in pursuit of a compelling, constitutionally legitimate interest expressed with sufficient clarity and concreteness to allow a reviewing court to determine, first, that the use of race was a necessary last resort in pursuing the interest defined, taking into account reasonably available nonracial alternatives. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Mr. Rein, may I ask, if we didn't have the 10 percent plan, if that were out of this case, and all that were left were the Grutter-like plan, would you then recognize that you had no claim? We have the -- what -- what the University of Texas has added on to the 10 percent plan.   But now we wipe out the 10 percent, and we have only the Grutter-like plan. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Well, I -- with respect, I -- I would question the premise of the question because it's not the Grutter-like plan in its entirety. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I know it's not -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " That would be a totally different -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " -- but -- but I'm asking the hypothetical. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " No.   And I'm saying even in the AI/PAI system it's not a Grutter-like plan.   It's not a plan of shaping a class by individualized one-to-one comparisons.   It's not aimed at a critical mass.   It's not a Grutter plan in that sense. But I think the -- the other part of this is that's, of course, not the case before us.   When you look at the satisfaction of a compelling interest, you look and ask: Does my preexisting system satisfy that interest? Do I have a need to do something else? And if I have a need to do something, is that something -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Assume need was proven. I know.   You're -- you're -- you're -- we're putting aside need.   What's wrong with this plan if need is put aside? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W.

Rein", "text": " If you have to use race and you want to use the model that was created in Bakke and Grutter, you would need to build profiles of individuals that would allow you to judge them one against another in the context of the class and the educational experience you are trying to create. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " My God, that sounds like it's using race more rather than less than this plan does. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " I -- I'm sorry if it sounds that way.   It is not.   It simply says, in a situation of the Bakke situation where you're looking at every aspect of an individual and you're trying to judge whether one or another of individuals for the -- for places, the last places would most benefit the class, the class as a whole as a learning entity, then you can, as Bakke indicates, take account of the fact that they may have different backgrounds, which would contribute different ideas. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How does that -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Those are whole-person comparisons.   This is not the system that -- this system doesn't do anything like Bakke. So if -- it's very different.   Even if you separate it from the necessity issue -- which is, of course, a major issue in this case, but I'm assuming your question -- that they've shown that they needed to use race, there was no other way to do whatever they were trying to do -- which isn't clear to me either -- so you have both the question of whether they've defined a legitimate compelling interest; you have the question of whether they've shown any necessity to use race.   But if I -- even I put those aside, whether this is the narrowly tailored vision that came out of Bakke is a very serious question.   It isn't.   It's quite different. And I can -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You still haven't answered why this is worse than Bakke.   I mean -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Because it -- it's not used to build a class.   It's just used to create a racial plus and to increase the number of minority admissions. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How is race given -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " It's race as such. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How is race given a plus? I -- I thought that what they're looking for is leaders in diversity, not just of race, but of experiences generally. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Those factors -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " I'm sorry.   But those factors were in the PAI before they added race.   Leadership; demonstrated awards and success out of school; overcoming obstacles, like a single-parent family. Those were all part of the PAI before race was added. Race was just tacked on, as they said, as a factor of a factor of a factor. They've shifted position as to how it's used.   In the -- in the district court, it was sort of minimized, a factor of a factor of a factor.   It's a minor plus; don't worry about it.   It's now become, well, it's a contextualized part of the PAS, which is part of the PAI, and we can discretionarily jack that up any way we want. But all those other factors that they claim -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I think your brief admitted that this isn't in favor of any particular race, that white people in some situations can show leadership, as -- as well as black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American.   Any race could benefit from this plus factor.   So how is this -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- worse than Bakke? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " With respect, we did not concede that, and we would not concede it because the other PAI factors might benefit anybody of any race.   People's circumstances, their leadership, their community efforts -- those are universal, and they can benefit any candidate.   But they don't benefit from the race factor. The race factor was designed to benefit -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But in Grutter -- in both Grutter and what Justice Powell said would be proper in Bakke, race was a factor.   Race, itself, was a factor. And that's why I'm finding it very hard to distinguish what the university is doing, apart from the 10 percent plan. But let -- let me ask you about the 10 percent plan itself, because it seems to me that that is so obviously driven by one thing only, and that thing is race.   It's totally dependent upon having racially segregated neighborhoods, racially segregated schools, and it operates as a disincentive for a minority student to step out of that segregated community and attempt to get an integrated education. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Justice Ginsburg, let -- let me respond to this, with respect, this -- this way.   The Top 10 Plan does not classify anybody by race.   It addresses only standing within the Texas educational system. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But it could work only in the background. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " When you say \"work,\" it works on a number of fronts.   It creates geographic diversity. It looks all over Texas.   It doesn't distinguish between high schools.   It creates socioeconomic diversity.   It does have an effect, a demonstrated effect on race because a number of minorities, the type they care about, are admitted under the top 10 program.   But it's not based on race.   It's based on the degree of effort you make relative to the other people with whom you're being -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " It is created because of race. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " I -- I'm not in a position to tell you why it was created.   It -- it was created -- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Is there any doubt that it was created to increase the number of minority students? Was there any other reason for the 10 percent plan? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Well, I've given you other reasons, which are it's a -- it's kind of a democratic recognition that you want to invite people from all over Texas, regardless of the school they went to.   You're looking for those who are trying the hardest, who are doing the best, who excel in their environment. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It was recreated in the wake of Hopwood. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " That -- that timing, yes. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " So I think that was the purpose, to find a neutral framework within which to satisfy the State's and the university's objectives. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " And certainly one in the legislature might have looked at the predictable effect, but that purpose and effect are different.   But yes, it was created, and in part, because certain schools do have minorities, the idea was, well, that would benefit those schools just as it would benefit a rural high school in a white community, which ordinarily would have very great difficulty placing its students in the University of Texas.   This system -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " You argue that the University of Texas' goals and -- or announced goals are insufficiently concrete. Can you give an example of what, in your view, would be a sufficiently concrete criterion or set of criteria to achieve diversity? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Well, and -- and certainly, the Solicitor General's attempted to do so by breaking down the abstract goals into concrete objectives.   One goal that certainly Grutter respects is, if you have studied your campus and you believe there's an inadequate exchange of views, and the minorities feel so isolated they cannot properly bring to bear their perspective on the campus, you can look at measures of how successful are we in this kind of dialogue and try to investigate that, and try to say, okay, is there a level -- you know, when do we reach a level of critical mass, which is the term in Grutter, where that exchange is vibrant and is taking place on our campus.   That's one measure. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, but I don't understand. How do you do that? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " It's not easy to do, and it's not our job to do it.   I mean, we're not here to tell them how to do it, but your -- if one wanted to endeavor to try to find this kind of concrete level, we're not saying quota, but we are saying you have to -- you, the university, if you want to use this forbidden tool, this odious classification, you've got to find a way to do it.   You've got to be able to explain what your concrete objective is. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Are there any critical mass studies that you can refer to? I mean, are there -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " None that I know about. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " -- scientific studies where you know at what point you suddenly have enough of a mass? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " No.   And -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So what did the university base it on? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " The university based it on two things.   It was short of the demographics of the high school graduating class, which is measurable but not legitimate, and it claimed that it was basing it on this classroom, a small-class study which they had conducted previously, which indicated that minorities were not present to the -- their satisfaction in a lot of small classes.   That -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Seven year -- sorry. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me. To their satisfaction.   I'm asking: On what do they base their satisfaction? On what do they base? Like, 15 percent, 20 percent? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " They premised it on good faith, and that was accepted in the Fifth Circuit on the first iteration of this case, and this Court said good faith does not suffice.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm sorry.   I thought that the study they did showed that in 1996, they had more participation in these smaller classes.   I don't know if they're really small when they're somewhere between eight and 25 people.   That was a -- but there were more of those classes in 1996 than in 2003 or '2 when they were looking at that study. It would seem to me that that suggests that there's less -- what they took from it, that there's less exchange of ideas in a classroom rather than more, based on this race-neutral policy. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Well, I think -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What's wrong -- since you have to infer these things, you can't use a quota. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Let me -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " You're saying we can't -- they can't use demographics.   So they use a study that shows there's less classes.   There's less people in classes.   They talk to administrators, faculty, and students.   They're having racial incidents on campus where students of color are complaining that they feel isolated, that stereotyping is going on, on campus. What more do they need? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Let me start with your first concern, which is this classroom study. First thing I would observe about that if I were in their position, and I'm not, is that the second study was done at a time when there were more minorities admitted than the first study, and they claimed it went backwards.   So that might tell me right away that the problem -- the necessity for using race could not be demonstrated for that, because when you -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Yeah.   Because the -- the necessity is not the necessity you're talking about. It's the -- as I read it.   I mean, you use words like \"critical mass\" and so forth.   It sounds like a cloud of sort of you don't know what they're talking, but as I read further into it, it becomes quite specific, that is, 75 percent of the students are at this university because they were in the top 10 percent of their class. And it doesn't take long before students and faculty in particular situations know who is who.   25 percent of the students in that class are admitted; they're good students, not in the top 10 percent on the basis of leadership, activities, awards, work experience, community service, family's economic status, school status, family responsibilities, single-parent home, languages other than English spoken at home, SAT score relative to school's average, and race occasionally, too. Okay? We're talking about that 25 percent.   And it won't take long before students in a class see that in that 25 percent, which means you aren't just in the top 10 percent of your class, in that 25 percent there is hardly anybody who is African-American or Hispanic.   And the -- and seven years of experience with that kind of thing led the faculty at meetings, administrators, and others to say, we should do more to see that that 25 percent has occasionally somebody who is a minority. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Does anybody but the faculty -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " That's what their program is.   It isn't something like critical mass, et cetera. And -- and -- and if you have to say, it seems to me, why is that not a diversity-related judgment of what is necessary? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " So, Justice Breyer, let me answer that. First of all, one thing your question establishes quite clearly is if one assumes premises from evidence that doesn't exist, you can draw conclusions that are perhaps invalid. So let me go back to -- to where you started.   You say these people are admitted on the basis of the various PAI factors, which you read.   That's not how they're admitted.   That PAI is only part of the admissions criteria. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " And it's not truly holistic because in the holistic systems, you look at the person as a whole.   Here you could have the most wonderful PAI and never come close to admission, because they use the AI independently.   So they're not admitted -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Every school is like that. Every school in the country that's a college that I've ever experienced is a combination of grades, class position, and a lot of other things. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " But -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " So I'm talking about people who aren't admitted; 75 percent are, solely on the basis of class ranking. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Yeah.   And -- and then you assume that people could identify them one from another. They're -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " I was going to ask that. Does anybody, except the faculty, know who this elite 25 percent is? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " No. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " And all of the 10 percent people identified themselves? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " No.   They do not. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " They go around in bunches, hey, I'm one of the 10 percent? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " They don't, and -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " They don't know who the 10 percent are, do they? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " -- and the level of admission to the faculty at the university subgroup in which they study, whether it's business or communications, there it's all done by AI/PAI.   They're all -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could I -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " They're all done equally. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Could I come back to the issue of classroom diversity? Because that does seem to me to be something that could be measured.   And maybe there's evidence in the record that measures it.   I don't know.   So that's what I want to ask you.   But the University knows which students, even if -- assuming that the students don't know, this University knows which students were admitted because they were in the top 10 percent and which were not. And presumably they have a record of all of the classes and which students enrolled in which classes.   And so it would seem to me to be possible to determine whether the students who were admitted under the 10 percent plan were less likely to choose to enroll in the classes in which minorities are underrepresented than the students who were admitted under holistic review.   Now, maybe that's in the record.   I haven't found it.   Is there anything in the record to show that? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " The best of the record, because they didn't study that specifically.   When they did the classroom study, they -- they did not try to distinguish who was in the class.   It was just a number count by -- by classification, how many minorities of this kind, how many of that kind.   They counted African-Americans. They counted Hispanic students, or -- and they counted Asians in that study, but they counted them by race. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " I don't want -- I don't want to pre-demit this line of questioning because I think it's important and we're well into the substantive issues. May I begin with almost a procedural point: Did you object to the University's request that this case be remanded to the district court? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " We did in -- in the Fifth Circuit. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " In the Fifth Circuit. It does seem to me, as Justice Alito's question, and frankly some of the other questions have indicated, that the litigants, and frankly this Court, have been denied the advantage and the perspective that would be gained if there would be additional fact-finding under the instructions that Fisher sought to give.   And that just -- we're just arguing the same case. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " It's as if nothing had happened. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " And -- and the reason for that -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And I -- it seems to me that Justice Alito's question indicates that this is the kind of thing that we should know but we don't know. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Well, let -- let me point out that the -- the purpose of strict scrutiny is not just to adjudicate.   It is to instruct the University that before you use the odious classification, before you employ race, you ought to know these things.   If you're going to depend on them, you ought to study them and know them.   So the failure to do that so there is no evidence is not just because they didn't put it in -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But they weren't given the chance to add additional evidence in order to meet that standard. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Well, they can't go back and recreate the past.   They can't -- they have put in all the evidence available to them about -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But they could answer some of the questions as -- like the ones Justice Alito added.   And I think it's a very important point. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " They could -- I mean, but they'd have to go back and study the conditions at the time they made the decision.   And I think that the failure to do that kind of thing indicates that the retreat to race was reflexive; was done on the day Grutter came down. "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Not only that.   Also the failure to put it in.   It was their burden to put it in, wasn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Yes.   And they knew that -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So we're going to say, oh, they failed to put it in.   Let's give them another chance. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Well, procedurally -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Let's do a do-over. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " They -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Send it back down so they can now put in what they should have put in in order to prevail the first time around. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " And that I -- I entirely agree with that.   And in -- in fairness, they knew that the standard was strict scrutiny.   Grutter had said strict scrutiny.   Bakke said strict scrutiny.   It was no surprise. And Justice Alito, more directly, the evidence we did find in the record indicated that where the most selective schools were concerned, which would then lead you to the smaller classes, more of the Top Ten minorities enrolled in that than the added minorities that they derived -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, the issue in this case is not whether the University can have holistic review. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " The issue is whether they can have as a component of holistic review after they have taken into account other characteristics that are not dependent on race; they can add race as an additional characteristic. And so if it were -- is there -- would there be any way of determining, if there were a remand, which of the non-top 10 admittees were admitted solely because of race? In other words, these students would not have been admitted taking into account leadership and family, education and socioeconomic background and hardship and everything else. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " According to the University of Texas, the answer to that is no.   They cannot make that determination because, in their view, race is contextual.   You cannot sort out those who could have made it without race from those who didn't. And -- and just in response to Justice Breyer, as fact of record, prior to the invocation of race, 15 percent of the non-top 10 admits were -- were the minorities who later benefitted from race. So it was not devoid of admits who were Hispanic or -- or African-American.   It was producing 15 percent, a marginal increase out of race was, if you try to measure it, very small.   And -- and I could think of reasons for that, but -- so they couldn't put that in. They denied that you could ever identify those students. So that would be a fruitless pursuit unless they completely change everything they said before. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " May I ask -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

And -- and there's no perfect answer to that when the University says they can't identify them.   But what we did is we looked at the historic period in which they were using the PAI, without reference to race, and compared that to the percentage admitted of the total student body of those admits in the period when they were using race, and they compare -- this is about a two and a half percent difference, so it's very small.

I don't think that's -- that small a change. In 2008, two -- 20 percent of all black students and 15 percent of all Hispanic students were offered admission through holistic review.

I don't want to get into that debate, but I do have a worry, which is: If you're reading proof of a compelling need, or proof of a compelling need, will any holistic review ever survive? Because as I'm reading your answer, to narrowly tailor, schools have to use nonracial means of doing it.

It -- it makes it difficult for those who have gone through an inferior secondary program to excel. So they cut that score to three.   They could cut it to two.   They could -- they could take measures which were aimed at looking at potential deficiencies in initial education because you come from a home where there isn't a college-educated person and say, we're going to take those further into account because they apply equally without regard to race.

It's part of the -- the exercise. You don't isolate it, because if you look at Justice Bakke's example, he's got A and B, two minority African-American students, and C.   And he says, depending where the class stands in the overall composition of this learning entity, you might choose A under one circumstance; vice versa, you might choose B; and sometimes you'll choose C without regard to race.

"}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To pick up on the questions this morning, I'd like to focus on three things.   One, why the record supports the Texas legislature's conclusion in 2009 that the holistic plan at issue was a necessary complement to the State's Top 10 Percent Law; two, why the record shows that Texas's holistic policy has had a meaningful impact on diversity at the University of Texas; and, three, why the record absolutely forecloses any claim that University of Texas has adopted a quota. With respect to the first question of necessity, there are three principle ways in which the record shows that the plan at issue was a necessary complement.   First, as Justice Breyer mentioned, there is a significant portion of the admissions pool, all out-of-state students, all students from Texas high schools that don't rank, some of the best high schools in the State, and all students just below the top 10 percent who are nevertheless great students who aren't eligible for admission under the top 10 percent at all. And the Fifth Circuit found that without the consideration of race in the mix for those students, admissions would approach an all white enterprise. Secondly, the record in this case shows -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me.   Just the admissions of people beyond the top 10 percent? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " That's right, which is an important component of the class, Your Honor. Second, and I think this goes to your point, Justice -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, on that point, can you determine which of the holistic admittees would not have been admitted if race was not added to the -- to the determination? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Okay.   This goes to the meaningful impact point, and I think there are several ways to address it, Justice Alito. First, what you can do is you can look in the increase in African-American and Hispanic holistic admissions after the consideration of race was added. And what you find is, is that in each year, 2005, 2006, 2007, the percentage of African-American and Hispanics admitted and enrolled under the holistic plan grew.   In fact, there was a 70 percent -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " That's not really my question.   My question was if you look at an individual person, can you tell whether that person was admitted because -- solely because of race? Whether that person would not have been admitted were it not for the fact that the person was an African-American or Hispanic? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Your Honor, I think, given the contextualized and individualized nature of that inquiry, that's going to be difficult.   But I think the record nevertheless answers your question because you can show a marked increase in diversity under the plan at issue.   I just -- I've just explained to you how the record confirms that holistic admissions of African-Americans and Hispanics increased markedly in each year. If you look at student body diversity overall, African-American enrollment increased by two, doubled from 2002 to 2008 from about 3 percent to about 6 percent. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What -- one of the things I find troubling about your argument is the suggestion that there is something deficient about the African-American students and the Hispanic students who are admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan.   They're not dynamic.   They're not leaders.   They're not change agents.   And I don't know what the basis for that is. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " It's -- really it's based on a terrible stereotyping that -- "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Your Honor, it's -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What is the basis for that -- "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " It's exactly the opposite.   This Court has said time and again that you can't assume that minorities think alike just because they have the same skin color.   What the University of Texas does is it considers -- it takes into account the fact that people who come from different experiences, different backgrounds are going to have different contributions to the class.   If you had the situation where all the out-of-state admits or most of the out-of-state admits were coming predominantly from western States, then the University of Texas and any university would try to get out-of-state admits from other parts of the country because it would want the -- both perspectives. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But -- maybe I misapprehended either the question or the answer.   But you're the one that says race can be relevant.   And then in answer to Justice Alito's question, you say, oh, that's stereotyping.   It seems to me that you're inconsistent. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " No.   What stereotyping, Your Honor, is saying, that just because you get a sufficient number of blacks or Hispanics under the 10 percent plan means that you can't look at the class holistically and say, we're not getting a variety of perspectives among African-Americans or Hispanics. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Yeah.   But what is the basis for saying that? That's what I don't understand.   It's kind of the assumption that if the -- if a student -- if a black student or a Hispanic student is admitted as part of the Top 10 Percent Plan, it has to be because that student didn't have to compete against very many whites and -- and Asians.   In -- in the high school class, it's a really pernicious stereotype. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " It's -- it's not a stereotype at all, Your Honor.   It's based on the undeniable fact about the manner in which the Top 10 Percent Plan operates.   The Top 10 Percent Law was enacted in response to Hopwood, and there's nothing -- there's no challenge to the law in this case that admits many well-deserving students.   But the fact is, is that -- that the way that the Top 10 Percent Law admits minority students is by admitting those students from the lower-performing, racially identifiable schools. And the way -- the reason we know that is because if you look at the Bill Analysis decided by Justice Ginsburg in her dissent the last time we were here, that analysis specifically says on page 4, because of the persistence of segregation in this State, minority students will be admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I don't doubt that that is one of the things that it does, and I would have thought that that would be something that you would regard as beneficial. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " We -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Wasn't that the -- the reason for adopting affirmative action in the first place because there are people who have been severely disadvantaged through discrimination and -- and lack of wealth, and they should be given a benefit in admission -- "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " And the University -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " -- but that's one -- one of the things that it does, but it's not the only thing that it does. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Your Honor, the University of Texas applauds those students.   It wants those students. Those students are admitted through holistic review as well.   Nevertheless, the University can look at an incoming class and determine that not all the perspectives among a particular class of students is being represented.   This is straight out of the Harvard plan in Bakke -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " This is a statistic that jumped out at me, which it seems to me contrary to the stereotype on which the Fifth Circuit panel proceeds and on which you proceed.   Of the African-American and Hispanic students who were admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan, 21 percent had parents who had either a bachelor's degree or a four-year degree.   And for the holistic admittees, African-Americans and Hispanics, it's 26 percent.   This is from a Class of 2008. So there isn't -- it seems to me it refutes the idea that all of these minority students who were admitted under -- or most of them admitted under the 10 percent plan come just from these predominantly overwhelmingly black and Hispanic schools with poor students.   It's just -- it doesn't seem to be true. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Your Honor, we've never claimed that all of them do.   That's a straw man argument.   But if you look at the data, what you would find, in particular look at the 2008 profile that we cited in our last brief on page 33, you do find that on balance, there is a difference in background of the students, African-American, Hispanic students, coming in through the holistic plan versus the Top 10 Percent Plan.   And that's no surprise, given the obvious purpose of the Top 10 Percent Plan.   The purpose of the holistic review plan is to take into account all considerations. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G.

Generally we agreed on those words. Words 1: \"The decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow from student diversity is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper.\" Okay? Now, words No. 2: The University must provide a, quote, \"reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision to pursue diversity.\" Your plan is pursuing diversity among the 25 percent who are not admitted under the Top 10 Plan.

Number one is, is the University made clear it was pursuing the educational benefits of diversity in the broad sense specifically recognized by this Court. This is on pages 1 through 3 of the Supplemental Joint Appendix. Number two, the University made clear that in its judgment the Top 10 Percent Plan, in particular as it grew to crowd out the class, was compromising its educational objectives.   That's on page 25a and 31a of the Supplemental Joint Appendix. Number three, the University made clear that because of the decrease in student body diversity under the very race-neutral policies that our opponents are asking this Court to impose, that additional measures were necessary to make sure that it was achieving its educational objectives. All of that is laid out in far more detail, frankly, than it was in Grutter or that it was in the Harvard plan.   It's amplified by the deposition testimony.

And so it was important in Grutter to say, look, this can't go on forever, 25 years.   And when do you think your program will be done? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Your Honor, as soon as we -- we can achieve the same -- sufficient numbers for the educational benefits of diversity without taking race into account, we will no longer take race into account. The strict-scrutiny inquiry focuses on whether or not there are race-neutral alternatives, which I think really is the way to police this.   And in this case, because it's backward-looking, you look to whether or not the University policies in place for seven years -- this is a distinct case.   You have a record of seven years of trying the race-neutral alternatives that they're proposing, top 10 percent, plus race-blind holistic review.   And the record tells you what happened. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, how -- what percentage of the class is -- what legacy is that a consideration for? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " University of Texas does not do legacy, Your Honor. But if you look at what happened -- and this is the second reason why it's necessary -- it's -- it's -- I don't think it's debatable that student body diversity suffered at the University of Texas under the policies that they're asking this Court to impose.   And in particular under African-Americans where you had evidence of glaring racial isolation, certainly in the classroom where 90 percent of the classes, the most common size, are zero or one African-American -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, on that subject, I don't know of any -- you haven't mentioned in your briefs anything that the University of Texas has done to increase racial diversity at the classroom level, other than this admissions program. And I mentioned during your -- your friend's argument a way in which you could determine whether the top 10 admittees are any more or less likely to enroll in classes -- small classes where there is a lack of racial diversity than the holistic admittees.   And I don't see -- and you haven't made any effort, as far as I can tell, to measure that. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Let me answer that in two ways. One, doubling the enrollment of African-American students, which happened from 2002 to 2008, is going to increase diversity in the classroom.   And we've looked at that, and it has. Secondly, with respect to diversity among particular majors, University does take holistic consideration of where -- which schools students are admitted to as well.   So its policy addresses that concern as well. But what the record does show, Your Honor, conclusively, I think, is that diversity languished at the University of Texas in the period where we had race-blind holistic admissions plus the top 10 percent, and that the plan at issue here was necessary to supplement that.   The Texas legislature found that. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " But I don't -- you could have determined whether this is -- whether the admission -- the addition of race to the holistic equation has done anything to increase classroom diversity. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " It has. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " And you haven't done that. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Your Honor, we've looked at in the five-year analysis -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " No.   As -- as comparing, this goes back to your -- your underlying claim is there's something deficient about the top 10 admittees, and I -- maybe -- if you have -- do you have evidence that they are less likely to -- to enroll in the classes where there's a lack of classroom diversity -- "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " There's a different breakdown there, Your Honor.   But I think there's two dimensions to this diversity issue.   One is just the glaring racial isolation that existed, particularly among African-Americans. And then two is an effort, through the addition of holistic review, to admit minorities from different viewpoints, experiences, and perspectives. That gets back right to the core of the essence of the diversity embraced by this Court in Bakke. If you look at the Harvard brief in the Bakke case, page 17, it specifically says, \"Our interests in the educational benefits of diversity would not be met if all of minority students were -- were coming from depressed socioeconomic backgrounds.\" "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " What is it -- what is it -- have you looked at the top 10 percent admittees, for example, to see how many of them are leaders, which is certainly -- and certainly a legitimate factor to look for, students who are leaders. At -- do you say, well, there are -- there are just not very many leaders here; these are students who all they do is study.   There's no evidence of that as far as I can tell. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " I don't think it's -- it's seriously debatable, but if we need evidence on this, let us put it into the record that a class selected by the holistic consideration of numerous factors is going to be more diverse in a way that promotes the University's educational interests than a class selected by a single factor. And let me give you the deposition -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I'm sorry.   That's not -- that's not the question.   It's whether students selected under the holistic process without giving extra points because of race. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " And there's two problems with that.   One, they're not -- minority students are not going to be selected.   It's going to become, as the Fifth Circuit found, essentially an all-white enterprise.   That's the first problem.

The holistic process, if race is not expressly considered, will not result in any minority students? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " No.   It's not zero, Your Honor. But take 2002 for example.   272 African-Americans out of a class of 8,000.   That's glaring racial isolation. University of Texas concluded that was unacceptable.

It didn't require evidentiary findings on that.

We also knew -- and it's interesting: The Texas legislature found that the holistic plan was a necessary complement.   The Texas district court judge did.   The Texas court of appeals judge and his colleague did.

Kennedy", "text": " If -- if you did not have the Top 10 Percent Plan, but you did have the program that you're advocating for here, the holistic review, would you have a better or worse chance of achieving the diversity you seek? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Your Honor, I -- I think the first thing I would like to say is that it's a different way.   And I don't mean to dodge the question by that. But what I would say is, if -- if that's a meaningful difference, then this plan is -- is in an even stronger light than the plan in Bakke and the Harvard plan.   Because the University of Texas has heeded this Court's message.   It's taken three-quarters of the class that it selects through a facially race-neutral system, the Top 10 Percent Law.   And what we're here debating is whether or not it can complement that policy by taking race into account for a quarter. Now, it may actually be that the university could achieve more diversity through the pure Grutter-Bakke-style plan, but we think, working with the Texas legislature, we've come up with a hydrid -- hybrid plan that works together to both -- to both address this Court's concerns about using race too much in the process, and addressing University of Texas's legitimate, core academic concerns about compiling a class that's diverse in all the ways that are appreciated by Bakke. If I could read one aspect of the deposition testimony here.   This is from Ms. Ishop on page 253a of the Joint Appendix, and she explains why top 10 percent alone is not sufficient. What she says is, quote, \"Considering an applicant on the basis of just their test score and class rank leaves out all of that life experience and circumstantial experience that an applicant faces that's   also important not -- not only to how they developed and the type of student they are, but also to what they contribute to our campus.\" That's what the holistic policy adds. If you exclude race from that mix, you not only aren't looking at the individual in all its respects -- and race still does matter in Austin and across this country -- but you're -- you're preventing the University from rounding out its class from complementing the single-minded way that the Top 10 Percent Law to achieve its diversity objectives in a way that is narrowly tailored to its interests, which this Court has found compelling. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Well, all of the colloquy so far indicates to me that, if you had a remand, you would not have put in much different or much more evidence than we have in the record right now.   Is that -- "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " -- is that correct? "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " No, it's not, Your Honor.   I mean, look, we think that the record is sufficient.   We think that the Fifth Circuit got it right. But -- but to be clear, we can certainly put in plenty of additional evidence.   I mean, there was a trial in Grutter, as Your Honor pointed out in your decision in Fisher I.   There's been no trial here. There is, at a minimum -- if -- if -- if our evidence doesn't cross the bar on strict scrutiny, at a minimum, we put in triable issues of fact on whether or not the holistic plan was a necessary offset, whether or not the university was achieving its educational objectives in an environment in which you had 272 African-American students enroll out of an incoming class of 8,000, an environment in which 90 percent of the classrooms had -- the most common side had zero to one.

You'd have experts and so forth -- "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Well, I -- I -- I think you can make those going in the University's favor.   And one aspect of that, frankly, is the two-court rule that this Court usually applies.   Both the district court and the court of appeals looked at this and made findings -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " What you're saying, we -- we have a -- a remand only if we lose.   I mean, that's what you're saying. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " Well, I mean, I don't want to be result-oriented about this, Your Honor.   But -- but I do think that -- that it's one thing to say in this record there are no triable facts, where the -- the courts below have gone that way.   It's another thing to second-guess.   And -- and the Court can.   It's a summary judgment issue.   But it's another thing, I think, to overstep the conclusions of the district court and the court of appeals here. And -- and I think it's particularly relevant here when it comes to the operation of the Top 10 Percent Law.   Our friends have challenged the fact that the Fifth Circuit discussed the way in which it operated, saying that that's outside the record.   If it is, let us put all that evidence directly into the record.   But they've never disputed the way in which the Top 10 Percent Law operates. What -- what I'd like to say too is, if this Court rules that University of Texas can't consider race, or if it rules that universities that consider race have to die a death of a thousand cuts for doing so, we know exactly what's going to happen.   Experience tells us that. University -- this happened at the University of Texas after the Hopwood case: Diversity plummeted, especially among African-Americans. Diversity plummeted at selective institutions in California, Berkeley, and UCLA, after Prop 209.   And that is exactly what's taking place today at the University of Michigan. Now is not the time, and this is certainly not the case -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " There are -- there are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to -- to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a less -- a slower-track school where they do well.   One of -- one of the briefs pointed out that -- that most of the -- most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas. "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " So this Court -- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they're -- that they're being pushed ahead in -- in classes that are too -- too fast for them.

Maybe it ought to have fewer.   And maybe some -- you know, when you take more, the number of blacks, really competent blacks admitted to lesser schools, turns out to be less.   And -- and I -- I don't think it -- it -- it stands to reason that it's a good thing for the University of Texas to admit as many blacks as possible.   I just don't think -- "}, {"speaker": "Gregory G. Garre", "text": " This Court heard and rejected that argument, with respect, Justice Scalia, in the Grutter case, a case that our opponents haven't asked this Court to overrule.   If you look at the academic performance of holistic minority admits versus the top 10 percent admits, over time, they -- they fare better. And, frankly, I don't think the solution to the problems with student body diversity can be to set up a system in which not only are minorities going to separate schools, they're going to inferior schools.   I think what experience shows, at Texas, California, and Michigan, is that now is not the time and this is not the case to roll back student body diversity in America. Thank you, Your Honors.

Here are the numbers.   With respect to African-American students admitted through the holistic part of the program, in 2004, which was the last year before race was expressly considered, that number was 141 admitted through that number.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, there's an aspect of the holistic review process done at the University of Texas which may militate against the admission of African-American and Hispanic students for a -- an ostensibly race-neutral reason, and that is, that as I understand it, standardized test scores count pretty heavily in that process. One of the things the University says it's looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not in the top 10 percent of their class.   And there are many who think that SAT scores and ACT scores are culturally biased.   So if you put less emphasis on that, you might not have the numbers that you just recited. Well, it's rather strange that we -- we construct a process that may disadvantage African-American and Hispanic students for an ostensibly race-neutral reason.   So then we have to add race in as a special factor to counteract that. "}, {"speaker": "Donald B.

What the -- what the Court said last time around is to satisfy the compelling-interest inquiry, the University has got to articulate a reasoned, principled explanation for its decision to consider the educational benefits of diversity in a matter that this Court has found to be constitutional and substantial. The University of Texas has met that standard, has articulated exactly the same educational benefits of diversity at exactly the same level of specificity that this Court held constituted a compelling interest in the Grutter case at page 330. It's exactly the same. And the -- the principal argument that my friend Mr. Rein makes in challenging that is, well, actually a lot of that is post hoc rationalization, in particular, the effort to find whether you call it qualitative diversity, diversity within diversity is all post hoc rationalization, that is simply not so. If you look at page 1 of the Supplemental Joint Appendix, the first page of the 2004 Proposal, the University specifically says that what it's trying to accomplish is to create a diversity of perspectives among minority students.   It says it again at page 28 in that proposal.   The Director of Admissions Declaration, page 43 of the Joint Appendix, says it -- it says it throughout.

And it also said that this is a matter to which this Court will give some, but not complete, deference to what the University decides.   What you're talking about is the need for the program. In addition to that -- and this is what I'd like you to focus on, because there could be a question of whether to send it back for more evidence or not.   So in looking through the record so far, on this specific point, I found an affidavit by a person named Walker, and that person named Walker described seven years of efforts to measure this stuff; described meetings of the faculties; described all kinds of discussions; described conclusions of the faculty members, and the admissions officers, and others, that you did need -- you did need affirmative action in the 25 percent of the not -- of -- of the holistic part. Now, given that that's there, and I found nothing to the contrary, is there a need for another -- I mean, this is a loaded question, but I am curious. If you say \"yes,\" because -- I mean, you know, there may be something that you should put in as well.   You may think it would help to put something in.   You may think it's not necessary.   But just to be safe, what do you think? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Yeah -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Is that affidavit the relevant one? Are there others? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " Yeah.   I think -- I believe that's the affidavit from the director of admissions.   And it is highly relevant, and there is other information.   In the latter part of our brief, we documented it. We think -- you know, our view, we argued for affirmance.   We think it's sufficient.   But if there is doubt, I do think the additional kind of information that might be developed in this case would be to look at the kinds of questions that the Chief Justice was actually asking about, how did the -- how has the program worked in practice over the period of time in which it's been implemented.   And I think that would be additional relevant information that might help make the judgment. If I could go to the process point, and then I will return to the need point. Process -- what the Court said last time around in this case was that the Court had to ensure itself without deference that the process provided for individualized consideration and that race did not predominate. Again, the University of Texas' plan has every one of what the Court in Grutter at page 334 said were the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan.   No quota.   Everybody competes against everybody else.   No automatic award of points.   Modest factor. And in addition -- and this goes to your question, Justice Kennedy, about whether there is an argument here that race is determinative -- Texas is different from the University of Michigan's law school plan in every one of the four ways that Your Honor identified as -- as being potentially troublesome and making race determinative. Unlike in Michigan, in Texas the percentage of African-American and Hispanics admitted does not mirror the percentage who applied.   It's different. Unlike Texas, the number -- excuse me. Unlike Michigan, the number in Texas of -- of admissions fluctuates year over year.   It's not the same every year. Unlike in Michigan, the bulk of Hispanic and African-American students admitted don't come from a small subset of the pool that's admitted after most are admitted based on grades. And unlike in Michigan, the -- there -- the admissions officers don't monitor the process all the way along, which would, as Your Honor suggested, perhaps create the risk that race would become determinative in latter stages of admissions.   None of that is true here. So -- so I think with respect to -- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

That's what the case comes down to. And I will answer your question directly, but I first want to make a point about how you don't -- how you shouldn't do it.   And you shouldn't do it the way the Petitioner has suggested you should do it. What the Petitioner has said is that the -- in order to -- in order to assess need, and the -- and the only way to meet -- meet the need portion of the strict-scrutiny analysis, is for the University to set a, quote, \"demographic goal.\" That's the Petitioner's language.

What we say is that it's not an -- a critical mass, numerical kind of analysis.   We say that what you do is you start with the University's articulation of the educational benefits it's trying to achieve.   You require the University to state in concrete terms what success will look like.

You -- you know, there could be a whole list of them.   But you would look at those.   You would look at -- you would look at those.   You would look at the University's analysis of those, and then you'd make a judgment whether the University has substantiated its case. And the burden, of course, is on the University.

I think that they can -- and -- and as happened in Grutter, I think they have -- the -- the interests that they rely on have to be the interests that they contemporaneously identified when they adopted the program.   I don't think there's an issue here on that. But I think the evidence can include evidence of how things are working in practice.

But with respect to that, we want to make sure, not just that there are strong African-American and Hispanic candidates in that ROTC program, but that everybody who graduates from the ROTC program, University of Texas -- white, black, Asian, Hispanic -- everybody knows how to lead effectively in a -- in a diverse environment in which they're going to be leading diverse troops.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " Now, that's certainly important, but to come back to my first question, is there anything to suggest that the top 10 percent students are less likely to enroll in ROTC or, when they do, they're not as good as the -- as the holistic admittees?

And this is an important interest for the United States generally, that when you think about what's at stake here, that the -- the interest in ensuring that we have military officers who can lead a diverse military force is critical. The interest in having law enforcement officers who are not just diverse but who can operate effectively within every racial and ethnic community in highly charged situations is critically important. Corporate America has told you that having a -- a -- a workforce that is able to function effectively in diverse -- in diverse situations is critical. And what I would just say in conclusion is that these are the considered judgments of people who actually have the responsibility to ensure that the vital functions of the government protecting the country with the military and with law enforcement and the vital functions of commerce -- these are the people who actually have to make sure that those functions are carried out.   And this is their considered judgment, and I submit it's -- it's worth considerable weight in your analysis. Thank you. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " If -- if I can ask a question.

And -- and I -- this question will sound very nitpicky and detailed and -- compared to what you were talking about. And I agree.   I notice that the briefs in this case are like the briefs in Grutter.   And to me that does suggest that people in the universities and elsewhere are worried that we will, to use your colleague's expression, kill affirmative action through a death by a thousand cuts. We promised in Fisher I that we wouldn't. That opinion by seven people reflected no one's views perfectly.   But that's what it says: Not fatal in fact. Okay.   That's what I'm focusing on.   It seems to me there are two parts to that, whether we have to send it back for another hearing or not. Part one you've dealt with.   That's is there a need? A matter which Fisher I says we will give some but not complete deference to the University, and as you say, we have -- you went through that. There is a second part which I want you to address.   The second part in Fisher, we said, there is no deference due the University.   On this part it's called narrow tailoring. You heard your friend on the other side admit, he said, admit,   maybe he believes it firmly, why use the word \"admit\"? -- he said that, in the plans of Grutter and the plans of Bakke, those were okay in respect to narrow tailoring because they did compare the students one after another and use race as a plus factor. Now, what is there in this record that will support the view that what Texas has done in respect to narrow tailoring is no worse than, perhaps even better than, what happened in Grutter or Bakke? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " So I -- I would point Your Honor specifically to the declaration at pages 483a and 484 -- and 484a of the Joint Appendix of the admissions director, in which he explains the way race is considered in the University of Texas system.   And that explanation says expressly, at page 483, that race is considered in exactly the same manner, and given exactly the same consideration as every other special circumstance's factor that the university considers as part of its holistic review. That -- I think that shows you that actually you know more about the way this program works than you did about the program that you affirmed in Grutter, and you have assurance based on that, and nothing in the record contradicts it that that's the way it operates.

Let me first indicate that one of the questions that's been asked repeatedly, as -- well, what impact did the use of race actually have? Judge Garza -- and this is at Appendix 200 -- tried to make an estimate, because you can only make an estimate, because UT didn't know, and they don't know now.

Rein", "text": " This is Appendix 250 to 251a.   It is Judge Garza's original dissent.   This is -- this is when -- and he repeated, essentially, the same point. But he calculated, and he made different assumptions, depending on how many of the admissions in the holistic program one would assume would be different because of race.   Because no one knows, and that -- and that's part of this. And clearly, one -- and -- and -- I can read you these numbers, but you can read them yourselves. It's a very small number.   And his most realistic estimate was that it would yield only 15 African-Americans and 40 Hispanic students in a class of 6,000.   So we're talking about a very small effect, even with assumptions that -- that actually exist. You know, one point is it's small.   The second point, equally important, is no one knew because they didn't study it. And then -- then we get the same point on this complementary, which was the big theme of the Fifth Circuit, oh, it's a necessary complement.   What does that mean? One sense, you've got to have some plan if you're going to cap the Top Ten at 75 percent, so it's necessary to do something.   But that doesn't make it a necessary complement. When you really look what the Fifth Circuit said, they said it's based on two assumptions: One, the Top Ten are drawn from these minority high schools. Where did they come up with that? They never studied the pattern of the Top Ten admits. How do you know that a Hispanic or an African-American student can't be in the Top Ten at what they call an integrated, high-performing high school? That's a stereotypical assumption. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I -- I -- I -- what you're saying, basically, is, is this is what the Fifth Circuit concluded and which the school basically agrees, okay?

For their educational needs, there are competing criteria.   They need to keep a certain SAT, or whatever that's called, AI index, that has to be high because of the quality they want to keep the school at.   That does discriminate against blacks on some levels, because the difference in numbers are high. So if you have something like this, you're -- what you're saying, basically, is, and what he's proposing, is change your educational needs across the board, and focus in only on race, and make sure that your school is black, Hispanic, or whatever on numbers that are going to reduce its educational quality. That's basically what you're arguing, isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " No.   And -- and to be fair, I mean, the first thing I was just pointing out is that to get to the conclusion of the Fifth Circuit, you have to first assume the pattern of admits in the Top Ten, where they come from, which was never established in the record, never studied. And the second is that you have to assume that those coming from -- all students coming from these integrated, high-performing high schools don't include, in their Top 10 percent, any minority. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Why? What we know is -- "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " That's what he assumes.

Rein", "text": " Justice Sotomayor -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- no matter what it does, it doesn't have enough numbers of black people. "}, {"speaker": "Bert W. Rein", "text": " That -- that comes back to the fundamental point. If we're just talking numbers, then you have to show the compelling need for more numbers, so that -- one of the reasons for defining your compelling need is that you have to then look at necessity in terms of the need. So as in Grutter, what they said was we have insufficient numbers of minorities to provoke the appropriate dialogue.   When we look at the class as a whole, we think we can do better if we introduce different points of view.   It's very individualized; it's a small class. So you can then say, increasing numbers -- which they were certainly after, you know, from three to 14 -- will meet that compelling need. Since they never bothered to administer, you know, to define the needs, it's really hard to say what they were after and why numbers would or would not satisfy, and whether the numbers they were generating, which included 15 percent of the so-called holistic admits so it wasn't all white enterprise, why that wouldn't work. The key point is, you have to come to the Court with the record.   You can't make it up later, because that would say do what you want, and when the time comes, make it up.   That's not -- no way to litigate. And in this case they said, we're ready for summary judgment; we've put in everything we need.   If you look at their specific proffers -- and the court of appeals, they said they wanted to take discovery.   And even Judge Higginbotham, their best friend, said, from who? What does Ms. Fisher know about this? What are you going to take discovery about? And he found no need in this Court, all they say is, we'd like to reiterate the benefits of diversity, but those were accepted, and we'd like a few testimonials about students admitted holistically without knowing whether they were the beneficiaries of the race or not.
