It's not this case. Suppose that three years from now lots such as these two lots in the same ownership become immensely more valuable than the two lots singly.   Each lot singly would be worth a hundred thousand, but these lots where you can build a bigger home are worth $500,000. The county wants a fire -- fire station and it takes Lot E.   What do they pay for it under your theory? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " They should pay for -- compensation for the taking of Lot E.   Any taking -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

Kennedy", "text": " And in your view, that's Lot E only. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " That's right. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " And they pay $100,000 only.

The compensation is determined by the lot that is taken. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " But the integrated -- the integrated use is determined by the market.   Your -- your theory completely ignores market factors. "}, {"speaker": "John M.

And in eminent domain law, which is the -- the hypothetical that you're providing, in eminent domain law, the presumption is exactly that: Compensation is limited to the parcel taken, unless that presumption can be overcome by the landowner proving that the two parcels are actually -- yes, there's a unity of use between the two -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Why isn't the value -- then why isn't that true here? Then why doesn't that defeat your theory here? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " It supports the theory.   It's the exact same principle, only in reverse.   Rather than the government limiting compensation to just the parcel taken, here the government is saying we want to combine the values of the two in order to find there's no taking.   But in both scenarios, you have to begin with the presumption of determining what is the relevant parcel that is subject to that analysis.   In both scenarios, either eminent domain or inverse condemnation, you have to begin -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Groen -- "}, {"speaker": "John M.

One of the things that makes this case odd is that there are family members all around.   Both sellers are the same family and the buyers are the -- but if I'm right, your argument would extend in the exact same way to a situation where you have two sellers who are completely independent of each other.   Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith have nothing to do with each other.   Another buyer comes in, also has no relationship with Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, and that buyer would be able to make the exact same argument that the Murr family is making in this case. Am I right about your argument? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Well, I'm not sure which parcel your -- your hypothetical is talking about.

Right -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And now the person who has bought these two standard -- substandard lots wants to build on them, and your argument would be the exact same. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " That -- that's right.   They're each independent, discrete, and separate parcels.   And the grandfather clause that is attached with this land-use ordinance would protect the development and sale rights of each parcel independently.

This -- Justice Kagan put in a hypothetical to -- to this one owner owns two parcels or two different people own two parcels, and they sell it to your one owner.   And the one owner knows the regulation says if you have two contiguous land pieces, you can only develop on one, if they're both below an acre or whatever the rule is.   Your rule would just do away with your expectations as a buyer. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Well, no.   The -- in that situation, the fact that someone might know that there -- there are regulations on properties does not change the time of the taking.   The taking occurs in 1975 when the regulations redefined the property rights, and that redefinition of the property rights does not insulate -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " But the parents -- it may have been a taking for the parents, but they never charged it.   The children when they took were subject to the regulation, and they knew it. "}, {"speaker": "John M.

"}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " That's a very different situation.   In Palazzolo, all we said was that if the seller has a takings claim, it's not extinguished just because the property is transferred; that the buyer could have the exact same takings claim.   But the Murr children are not asking for the -- for the -- they do not have the same takings claim as the Murr parents did; isn't that right? "}, {"speaker": "John M.

For the parents, the two properties were two properties.   It's only when the property becomes one property that this takings claim arises. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " The takings claim arises because of the restrictions imposed by the government, not by change in ownership or anything like that.   The change in ownership does not change the nature of the property interest.   That's the key part of Palazzolo, that if you take away the -- the takings claim or redefine property interests, you're actually changing or altering the nature of property.   And -- and that's where we come back not to a takings analysis, but to defining the relevant unit of property to apply the takings analysis. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But the -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, then -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The -- I'm sorry. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Please, follow up. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " The -- the -- the regulation here, the only thing that it affected for the Murr parents and for the plumbing company was their ability to sell to a buyer who wanted to combine these two lots. That was the only thing that was affected; isn't that right? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Well, the parents didn't seek to combine these two lots or to sell to someone who wanted to combine the two lots.   The parents owned both parcels.   They had one in the plumbing company name. They eventually put that in their own names as well in 1982, after the 1975 restrictions were in place.   That didn't merge the parcels.   There's -- there hasn't been a merger here.   Merger is simply a term that describes what happened, and that is, that the use restrictions preclude the independent sale or development of Lot E. That is the gravamen of the takings complaint. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " And we're told these merger rules have a long history.   Many States have them.   So why isn't that background State law that would -- would apply? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " There -- there are lots of -- of land-use regulations of all types, including merger provisions.   We do not have a background provision here, a background principle because you can't have a background principle that applies to one person, but not to another.   If someone else owned Lot E, they can develop it.   So it's not a background principle to say that -- that this only applies to the Murrs. Same thing in the neighborhood.   This is the St. Croix Cove subdivision.   There's over 40 developed residential lots here.   There's nothing about building a home on this property that rises to the level of a nuisance or something that takes the right to use the property out of the title that -- that is that property -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M. Kennedy", "text": " Your answer to Justice Ginsburg is that all of those other State regulations are also invalid. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " No.   Those regulations are fine, whatever they may be, and they come in all -- all types of forms.   The question here is what unit of property do we utilize for determining the takings analysis? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Once you determine that, then you determine, okay, under that merger law or whatever land-use ordinance, does it reach a level of magnitude of interference that there is a taking? And those would have to be -- be analyzed on the merits of their own situation. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I thought your argument was that under State law, the properties were not formally merged, that the merger was only, I think as the Court put it, an effective merger. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " That's exactly right.   There -- there has been no formal merger.   These remain separate legal lots today.   This -- this term \"merger\" has been used very loosely, and all it really means is that the Murrs' right to independently use and develop Lot E has been destroyed. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.", "text": " I'm sorry. Do we know exactly how Wisconsin and the county define \"common ownership\"? For example, if one lot is owned by an individual in that person's own name, and then the adjacent lot is owned by a wholly-owned corporation or LLC, is that considered to be common ownership? Or if one lot is owned by, let's say, four siblings and the other one is owned by only three of the siblings, would that be common ownership? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Under the way Wisconsin has applied common ownership, as long as they are not informally the same name -- so here William and Dorothy Murr, they fully owned their plumbing company, and so they were technically in -- in different ownership and that was enough to be in separate -- "}, {"speaker": "Anthony M.

Holmes says that a regulatory taking violates the Constitution unless it's compensated when it goes too far. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Correct. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " All right.   Now, what you want us to do is to put some pretty clear lines in that word \"too far.\" "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " My problem is, I can't think of just what those lines should be, that -- that, perhaps, there are many different circumstances in many different factors. For example, in your case, I imagined that what the State was concerned about is they want to preserve a lake.   At the same time, people own some property around that lake and they used to be able to build houses.   So here's what they say.   You can build one.   One.   And it doesn't matter if you have six lap parcels not together or -- one.   One is what you can build because, after all, this Constitution is concerned about, to paraphrase Justice Warren, protecting people, not rocks. And so we look at the people and say, how does this affect them.   And in this case, you have a case, but there's some factors against you, and the -- the Federal Circuit and other opinions of ours have avoided drawing clear lines. And you see where I'm going.   And I just want your general response. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Yes.   This case does not address the merits of whether there's a taking.   This case first has to deal with the threshold question of what is the relevant unit of property -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " And that's what I'm objecting to. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " -- and is it one parcel -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Now, see that's -- now you're not getting my question. Because my question is: Why look for that? Is it relevant? Yes.   Is it determinative? No.   If we start making determinative rules, developers will take 500 acres.   They'll break them down into 500 different properties, State perhaps aiding in this, 500 different ones; three of them will be just wetlands, and they'll say, see, you took my three, when, actually, he started out with 500, and it wasn't a big deal. You -- you see the kind of problem? They're written about in the briefs. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Well -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I want your general reaction. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Well, the general reaction is you must begin with the approved legal lots of record that have actually been approved and that have attained -- because they are legal lots of record, they have rights that's in dispute. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Mr. Groen, one of the -- "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " That's what Roth is all about. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " One of the oddities of your position is that you seem to be taking half of State law.   In other words, you're saying well, there are these -- there are these lot lines, and everything has to depend on the lot lines because they've been legally approved.   But there have been other things in this case that have been legally approved too, and one of them is this merger provision.   And you seem to be saying: Well, we look to State law for the lot lines, but then we ignore State law for the question of when lots are merged. And why should we do that? If we're looking to State law, let's look to State law, the whole ball of wax.   In other words, saying: Well, when I buy those two lots, they're really not two lots anymore. According to State law, they are one lot. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " In defining property interests, Roth and this Court in Lucas note 7 both recognized that you look to the State law, not to the whole body of State law, you look to the State law that governs the creation that's the legal recognition of lots and the protection of the property interest. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, I -- I think that you're right, Mr. Groen.   It's like the legal recognition of property.   But the legal recognition of property has something to do with lot lines, and it also has something to do with when lots are merged, when two lots are merged into one.   And why would we ignore that question of merger? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " There's two reasons.   One, they have not been merged.   That -- and that's the point we were discussing earlier.   They have not been formally merged. And, two -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " And what would it take to be formally merged? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Elimination of lot lines. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " And that has not happened. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Because if the Court -- "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Because if -- if they remain -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If the State can say we don't have to eliminate lot lines.   All we have to do is to say the -- the lot lines don't have legal effect for some purposes. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " And it's only for the limited purposes of precluding sale or development. But more than that, your question comes right back.   It circles right back to Palazzolo, where you really have to define property interests by the rights that are already in place that secure benefits. That's what Roth stands for.   That's what Lucas footnote 7 stands for.   And Palazzolo points out the principle that you cannot then go forward and say: Oh, well, the State has redefined this -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, again, I think -- "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " -- so now you -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " -- Palazzolo depends on the buyers having the exact same takings claim as the sellers, which it seems to me does not exist in this case. But let me ask you a different -- a different way around the question, which is, whether you think reasonable expectations matter at all in your framework? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " The reasonable expectations that were addressed in Lucas footnote 7 are the expectations that grow out of the traditional understandings of property law.   People understand when they buy a lot in a subdivision that they are buying a -- a -- a lot that has a right of use, that -- that has a deed, that has geographic boundaries, and that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Okay. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " -- what they are relying upon. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But here, if I'm buying property in this area, I also know that there are these rules about when you can develop on substandard lots and how it is that contiguous lots are understood for purposes of that development potential.   So why aren't I buying subject to those preexisting regulations? In other words, this is not a regulation that just happened to me when I was an owner.   I'm buying subject to -- and property is a bundle of sticks; we know that, right, first year of law school.   And I'm buying, you know, certain metes and bounds, but I'm also buying into a certain set of things about what I can and can't do on the property.   So why isn't that perfectly consistent with my reasonable expectations? I'm supposed to know the zoning regulations, and when I buy a house, when I buy a piece of land, I'm buying subject to the preexisting zoning regulations. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " I understand the use of reasonable expectations under the Penn Central for determining whether there is a taking.   But here, we're -- we have to first determine what unit of property is it.   Is it Lot E, or is it Lot E and F combined? And in that situation you have to look at the creation of the property.   Property is property.   And it doesn't change -- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " But what about -- I -- of course, property is property.   But we are still dealing with a provision of the Constitution that, in the regulatory area, is designed to prevent takings that hurt somebody unreasonably.   It goes too far. So why isn't what you want to look at one more thing to look at? But we might look at others too. We might look, for example, at whether the individual who bought that property at the time he bought it knew about this restriction.   We might look at how, overall, he has hurt in any related way.   We might look, for example, at the kind of need that was there, and we might see two big questions. I mean, one big question is -- though it's awfully general -- is, is he being treated unfairly either because we're forcing on him the whole cost or a lot of the cost of something that benefits many, many others, or because we are interfering with investment-backed expectations. I mean, as you read the cases it seems to me there are a set of factors like that.   And my problem with your argument is it wants to take one and then apply a kind of mechanical test. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " No.   It keeps coming back to you -- the -- the task is to first define the unit of property.   The Murrs -- the Murr parents have two separate distinct lots.   Each is -- is a -- is a lawful legal building site, and if owned by anyone else, it remains a lawful legal building site. Under the restriction enacted in 1975, it went from two building sites to one building site. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " May I -- "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " That is what has been lost. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " May I ask a question? I do think, as I'm reading all of the briefs in this case, that the issue is how much weight should we be giving to the State boundary lines, the State property lines. You say as a denominator on the takings claim, there -- it's fixed.   You used the word \"presumption\" in your brief, but you haven't explained to me what overcomes the State boundary line -- property lines, so I don't think the word \"presumption\" has any meaning in your brief. Others, like St. Croix and -- and the government, and embedded in Justice Breyer's question, thinks the denominator should be a more nuanced calculation, although St. Croix, Wisconsin, and the Solicitor General seem to have a different weight to that. So let's start with, is yours a fixed presumption? Does anything ever overcome it? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Yes. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Or is it, under every circumstance, the denominator? "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " In -- in -- you must begin with the presumption of identifying the single parcel.   And nobody, as you point out -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " What over -- "}, {"speaker": "John M.

Groen", "text": " -- presumption is overcome if you have facts that are sufficient to show in fairness and justice that the individual should bear the burden. And an example, we can draw straight out of eminent domain law.   If you have a hotel owned by a person and they own the parking lot next door, there are two separate parcels, and the government is going to condemn the parking lot.   The parking lot is used with the hotel as an integrated economic unit.   The presumption in eminent domain law is the same principle here. Government is taking only the parking lot, and they will argue we will only pay for the parking lot. The burden then shifts to the property owner to prove that the parking lot is an integrated part of the operation of the hotel. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So what's the difference between that and the factors that the other parties are using that says look at how the property's been used over time. Here, the family has a house on one parcel, a volleyball court and a barbecue storage area on another.   They use the other parcel -- house on one side, the other parcel has access to the beach.   The house has not had an economic value to the children.   It was there.   They're using it. "}, {"speaker": "John M. Groen", "text": " Right.

It makes an enormous difference whether we're going to say that those 15 percent are independent lots, because if they are, then the developer comes in and says you have to pay me for all of that.

The only additional restriction upon the parents that was placed in 1976 by the State was a conditional sale restriction.   That is, you can do anything with the lot you want.   You can sell to whoever you want.   The only thing you can't do practically is sell it to someone who only wants to buy it if they also own a lot next door and also is substandard.

If some -- somebody buys a lot next to that person's house with the expectation of selling it at some point in the future to meet real needs that come up then, and then the -- a regulation is adopted that says well, sorry, you can't sell it, that there's no hardship there? "}, {"speaker": "Richard J. Lazarus", "text": " The -- the hardship -- the question though is how do you define the extent of the hardship.   And what you want -- what you need to look at under the Penn Central analysis is what the economic impact is, and to define the parcel part of that is to -- to identify what the impact is. In -- for instance, in this case, the economic impact on the Murrs, right, has to take into account the shared value of the two because the fact is, if you look to what -- there is no general issue of material fact with the lower courts on this question. The value of the two parcels together for one house is $698,000.   The value of two houses separate, with a house on each, is $771,000. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, that's fine except that, in order to realize the value of the two lots put together, they would have to move away. "}, {"speaker": "Richard J.

Lazarus", "text": " The takings inquiry is what the economic impact is on them.   It shouldn't be a different test depending upon their particular subjective preferences, then someone else's subjective preferences.   The -- the fact is -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I thought the -- I thought that what you're saying is we have to look at what's fair and just, and now you say, well, we disregard the situation of -- of the particular people who are involved. "}, {"speaker": "Richard J. Lazarus", "text": " Well, no.   You're looking at -- it's several things.   You're looking at first what the economic impact is.   Define the parcel in a way which actually evaluates the real impact.   Not a fictional impact, but the real impact.   The real impact here is very little. You're also taking account the -- the State law.   You're looking at the law at the time to figure out what the reasonable expectations are of people. You're taking that into account as well. The other thing you're taking into account, Your Honor, is the point you mentioned before. Contiguousness by itself wouldn't be enough.   We aren't arguing that.   One thing you look at is the State law for expectations. You also look at the physical and geographic characteristics of the property; in other words, to find out whether there was any real potential here for unity of use and integrative use.   For instance, in this case, if Lot E and F were different and you had one up above and one down below, that might well be a harder case to suggest that there was that kind of unity of use, integrated. And you look at those three things, because what you're trying to look for to evaluate the parcel is you're trying to see what the real burden is that people are suffering in the case. You know, it's a remarkable finding that there's such a little difference in value between one house on two and two houses each on one.   And the -- and the reason for that, there's actually a formal term in economics for it.   It's called the complementarity principle.   You don't need to know that term.   It's just common sense. There's some kinds of property, land is one of them, that can create value joined that doesn't exist when separate.   The most extreme example are shoes.   No one would pay very much for just a right shoe or a left shoe, but they pay a fair amount for the two shoes together.   Land is not an extreme example like shoes, but the same phenomenon exists -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " It seems to me you're -- you're trying to figure out then what the land interest is.   And usually there's a regular way to do that, which is you go down to the county office and you look at what the -- the lines are between your property and somebody else's or your lot and a different lot. You don't look to whether one is below and one is above, or that, and it seems to me that gets into a very complicated situation when for Federal takings purposes you're redefining what State law says property is. "}, {"speaker": "Richard J. Lazarus", "text": " What -- what you're doing -- what you're doing, Your Honor, is you're trying to determine the economic impact.   There's no question State law defines what you own, but the question of whether it's a taking -- it's a question of Federal constitutional law, and the economic impact inquiry has to see to what extent there really is this incredibly disproportionate burden they're facing or not. In -- in the Penn -- in the Penn -- oh sorry.   In the Penn Central case, in the Keystone Bituminous case, every one of those cases State law defined as separate property interests, things can be bought and sold, the air rights can be bought and sold, the support estate can be bought and sold, real estate can be bought and sold under State law.   There are distinct property rights under State law, and the Court nonetheless, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, joined them together because the Court wanted to find out whether, in fact, there was that kind of economic burden.   And they even did it in cases involving lot lines. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, what about adding here when I look to see the reasonableness of the regulation.

And in this case -- in this case, this is really the easy case.   It's almost a sui generis case because the -- the State law at issue was one which -- which is premised on the notion that under this circumstance you actually don't face such a great hardship.   That's exactly why they don't get the exemption. This isn't -- they are not challenging restriction.   They're actually challenging not getting exemption which someone else is getting.   And the reason they're not getting that exemption is they don't have the same hardship that other people have. The -- the owner of the isolated lot, substandard lot, asks for some kind of exemption.   They face the prospect of a complete economic wipeout.   But the owner of two substandard adjacent lots, they don't. That person, like the Murrs, they have development options. In addition, they have the opportunity, as I said before, to created value, value that doesn't exist separate.   And in this case, the value of joining the property together, the reason why this property -- which is beautiful property, stunningly beautiful, St. Croix River, at the bend of the river.   The reason why it's so valuable is two things: River frontage and privacy. That's the touchstone of value here. Lot F is only 58 feet wide at the bottom, the distance between the two columns in this room, and right next to a public area.   Lot E has a hundred feet, twice that, of river frontage.   And off to the west, more privacy.   When you add those two lots together, the value of this luxury lot at the bend of the river is so great, it actually almost overcomes the loss of value of not having the second home on the lot.

And as Justice Breyer just noted, we think the lot lines are certainly relevant, especially insofar as they might shape reasonable expectations about how property owners expect to use their property and what they expect to remain separate and distinct.   But we urge this Court not to adopt a presumption or a bright line rule that focuses on lot lines in isolation.   And we really see two principal problems with that, one of which is practical, and the other is legal. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. "}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth B. Prelogar", "text": " Turning to the practical point first, especially when you're looking at contiguous commonly-owned property, which is the situation the Court is confronting here.   We think that lot lines will frequently not be an accurate indicator of how that claimant is being burdened by the particular regulation, and that's because when you have those contiguous commonly-owned lots, there's a physical unity that frequently opens up the potential for linked use, linked development, a direct reciprocity of advantage, and shared value. And so when thinking about how to address the parcel as a whole issue, where the whole purpose, the whole point is to get a feel for how the regulation is actually impacting this claimant, focusing on lot lines would exclude relevant considerations about the on-the-ground economic realities. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So that's -- I just don't know how that works with -- with property.   Not asking whether there's a takings, but asking whether there's property.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Temporal considerations. Now, you usually don't say that when you're asking about property.   You say, I owned Lot E or I own Lot F, and here it is on the map; that's what I own. You don't sit down and say: Well, but with spacial considerations I own this much of it, and when temporal considerations, add this, and functional that. It seems to me that those concerns are pertinent at considering whether there's a taking of the property.

But we think that this relevant parcel determination does come into the second part of the inquiry in terms of whether there's been a taking. It's about how do you get a feel for the -- the relevant unit of property that's at issue to determine how this regulation is actually affecting this claimant, and so we would put those considerations on the taking side of the line. This Court has always shown a preference in deciding, as Justice Breyer said, and -- and Justice Holmes' famous formulation whether a regulation goes too far, the Court's always shown a preference for being able to engage in that kind of contextual analysis that focuses on all of the relevant facts and circumstances.

Beginning with the multifactor nuanced approach, the reason why that kind of approach to defining the property interest -- remember, the first issue, you have to define the property interest that is the subject of the takings -- of the takings claim.

You may not choose to look at it, but you -- you should.   Ignorance of the law is not a defense anywhere.   I don't know why it should be in the regulatory context.

That's the protection that's talked about in Roth v. Board of Regents. The second thing is this valuation question. And couple of points on that.   All the discussion about, well, the property is valuable because it's waterfront, all of that discussion goes to the merits of the takings claim; in other words, how much economic impact is there? The first step is to define the relevant unit of property for analysis.   And that step is looking at the deeds and the -- the geographic boundaries of Lot E. That is the presumption. When you turn to the valuation question, the notion that Lot -- the combined Lot E-F has value because it's waterfront, that is ignoring the fundamental aspects that the valuation in a residential lot is because you can build on it.   And that is what has been taken from the Murrs.   They previously had two building sites; now they have one. The valuation that the county discusses, the value is not attributed to Lot E, because Lot F has the building site.   So, really, the county is getting a windfall by suggesting that, oh, well, you can have this bigger, better lot, and that will enable you to -- to recover from the compensation.
