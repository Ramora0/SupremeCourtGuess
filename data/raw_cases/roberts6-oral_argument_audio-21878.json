[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument next in Case 10-545, Golan v. Holder.   Mr. Falzone. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   Section 514 did something unprecedented in American copyright law.   It took millions of works out of the public domain, where they had remained for decades as the common property of all Americans.   That violated the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment.   Let me turn first to the Copyright Clause.   In Eldred, this Court held Congress gets to pick the date on which a copyright expires, and it can extend that date before we reach that date. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " You said that Congress can set a time limit.   In this case, we are dealing with, let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of copyright, and Congress says: No, we think Shostakovich should be treated just like Copeland.   Yes, we took care of our own when we weren't part of the world community, but now we are.   And so all that Congress is doing is giving Shostakovich works the same limited work as Aaron Copeland.   And why does that violate the limited-time prescription? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " The problem is Congress is now setting a second limit long after the first one has come and gone. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But the person -- the person we are talking about, the work we are talking about, never got the first limit.   There was no, there was no time, there was no time when that work could have been protected.   So why isn't it consistent with the Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited time protection?   We are not talking about a case where you've had the protection, enjoyed it and then it expired, and then Congress says: We'd like -- we like your work so much, we are going to give you another term.   What's affected here are people who were unprotected.   And Congress says we think that they should have a limited time. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " So let me just clarify one thing.   Many of the works that were restored here did get some time, 28 years, and were not renewed.   But to get back to your question about the works that got none-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " They didn't get the equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the large category, because it's the ones that you feature.

Falzone", "text": " --Congress has been setting the limited time at zero since 1790.   In the 1790 Act, Congress set the limit at zero for a wide array of works, those that did not comply with formalities, those that were written by foreign authors-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " That's not a limited time.   That's saying you have no time. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " --Well, but saying you have no time is itself picking the limit because the language of the Copyright Clause forces Congress to pick a limit that constraints copyright by marking its end.   And when -- If a limit does not mark the end once reached, then there is no limit, there is no end. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " But it has to have a beginning, too.   And for these people who were unprotected, because we didn't recognize their copyright, there is no beginning. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T.

Congress may grant exclusive rights, but it can also say your limit is going to be zero, we decide that you're not going to get any exclusive rights.   Every Congress since 1790, every time it went to add subject matter, every time it went to extend the duration of copyright, respected that choice to give no time.   And in fact, the time -- the decision to make foreign authors ineligible is a decision that Congress has never gone back on.   None of the exceptions the government points to remove anything from the public domain that was placed there based upon a lack of national eligibility.   200 years of history is crystal clear about-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " I can understand your argument that the public domain is untouchable.   I'm not sure I get that from the Constitution, that says to secure to authors for a limited time the exclusive right.

The -- the operative language is the limited times restriction, and the limit it requires Congress to pick is the date at which all protection ends for good, and Congress has picked zero since 1790, and respected that decision, and that is no accident.

Ben Johnson never got any time, but on the government's theory we could give him 100 years right now.   This statute did work differently.   It certainly restored copyrights into the existing period.   That's correct.   That is an accurate description of this statute.   But that is not a limit that's contained anywhere in the government's interpretation of limited times.

But here is the problem.   If Congress wanted to reach that work, here's all it has to do on the government's theory, and even under the mechanism of section 514.   All it needs to do today is extend existing terms 100 years, and then reach back and restore into that existing term.   So on the government's theory and even by the mechanism on which this statute operates, the government could reach back and protect de Tocqueville. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Under your -- under your theory, let's say you have a copyright that expires on October 5th, okay?   On October 4th, Congress could extend that for 25 years.

There were other States, and you make a big deal in your brief about common law protection, but common law protection, particularly in New York, which you relied on, only extended to unpublished works.   Once a work was published, it was no longer protected under the common law.   That was true of most States.   And some States gave copyright protection to residents of their own State but not to residents from other States.   So it took a whole body of public works and gave them copyright protection the day they decided to pass the copyright law.   So what are you doing telling us that there has never been a historical experience with Congress taking public works out of the public domain? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " Well, let me be clear about what happened in 1790.   The 1790 Act did not remove anything from the public domain.

You said New York provided no common law protection for published works.   With respect, that's not correct.   The Naxos v. Capitol Records case, the highest court of New York, says New York common law provided protection for published works right up to the point where the Federal act cut it off.   And if you look -- and if -- if the question is whether the first Congress intended to take anything out of the public domain in 1790, the answer is you simply cannot reach that conclusion, because everything contemporaneous with the first Congress, the history of the common law in Britain, decided by Millar v. Taylor and Donaldson v. Beckett, recognized common law rights in published works.   The Federalist Papers spoke about Millar, and everything contemporaneous-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " If we disagree with your proposition, does your argument fail?

You can extend the statute of limitations before it's expired, but once it's expired it's over.   The problem with using that as an analogy is that there was a beginning.   Time ran out, and you're trying to deal with a situation here where you say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S. work, but it's unlimited; you -- you cannot treat the foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time, the same limited time that you would give a U.S. work.   You're saying these people had no time and they may never have time. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T.

And make no mistake, our position is, insofar as they removed anything from the public domain, they are unconstitutional.   But even if the Court doesn't want to go that far, I think the wartime statutes and the other small handful of exceptions the government points to fit quite well into a very limited exception for eligible authors who show nothing more than the familiar concept of excusable neglect, which has operated -- again, in very narrow situations -- to relieve people of the consequences of deadlines.

I don't really think that's a fair description of the situation.   It obscures what Section 514 actually does and what Congress is all about here.   Since 1891, Congress has concluded as a matter of copyright law that foreign works are entitled to the same protection as domestic works.   The problem with respect to the authors that Section 514 covers is not that Congress set the copyright limit at zero, it's that as a matter of foreign relations, we did not have treaties with these individual countries.   And what 514 does is remedy that be problem.   What 514 says is: With respect to a defined set of foreign authors, they get the remainder of the copyright term that they would otherwise have gotten, and nothing more, had they lived in countries where we had -- with which we had copyright relations at the time they published, or had they complied with the formalities that we used to enforce but no longer do to perfect and renew copyrights.   That's what it does.   It doesn't grant anybody a perpetual term.   It does not renew a copyright term that has run its full course and create a new one.   It rectifies that problem which doesn't, doesn't reflect anything about a congressional judgment setting the copyright term at zero.   It could-- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A.

And the why here is very important and I think provide the answer to Justice Scalia's question about how 514 contributes to the progress of arts and sciences.   What 514 does, 514 is, in essence, the price of admission to the international system.   We decided, the policymaking branches of our government, the executive and the Congress, decided that we needed to be, and was in the national interest, to be part of the international copyright system and to join the Berne Convention to accomplish that.   The reason we did so was because our intellectual property is subject to very serious levels of piracy in many foreign countries because of under enforcement.   By joining Berne, what we did was commit ourselves to the international standards.

So it creates many, many more than one new work.   And I think it's also quite reasonable, Justice Breyer, to read the incentive structure here in a way parallel to the way the Court did in Eldred, which is to say that just as in Eldred the Court assumed that there was an implicit guarantee to an author making a creation that that author would get the benefit, not only of the existing term of copyright but any extension, I think here with respect to American authors, it's an implicit guarantee that they get the benefit not only of the foreign protection in existence at the time, but any expansion of foreign protection through adjoining treaties, and Article 8 and Section 514 implementing Article 18 of Berne is the price of admission to that treaty-- "}, {"speaker": "John G.

The idea/expression dichotomy, fair use; and -- and that is going to provide -- maybe -- maybe Jimmy Hendrix could claim fair use in that situation.   And those are at the core of the traditional contours of copyright.   So if Congress were to try to extinguish fair use, I'd say yes, we'd have a First Amendment issue there.

"}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " I think it is going to tip the balance, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- the reason Congress enacted section 514 at the urging of executive branch officials who were charged with trying to ensure that we could integrate ourselves into the international system of copyright protection was that if we didn't have this provision, then we were not going to be taken seriously.   Our works were not going to be protected in these foreign countries, and that it would defeat the purpose of joining Berne in the first place. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " It couldn't have been that -- it must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it?   Because the only concern is not about protecting new works in the foreign countries -- the concern as I understand it was that we've had things in copyright for many years, and we want retroactive protection there.   The countries that didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of the Berne Convention.   Rather, we pursued them in the WTO for many years, and I guess somebody might pursue us and then you get into an argument about whether there are other ways.   Now, is that strong enough to overcome what these briefs are full of?   I'll give you an example.   Save The Music is charged with looking for Jewish music in the periods '30s, '40s, and '50s.   Other organizations might find a treasure trove of literature that was -- that was copyrighted in Czechoslovakia or in Warsaw, and they want to put it on the web, and they want people to listen to it.   But they have no more idea of how to track down the person on that, and they aren't protected by any notice requirements because they aren't reliance parties.   We're told by Barbara Springer, former registrar, that there are millions of such instances where people would like to go back and would like to put music literature, film, et cetera, in a form that people can use it today and there is no way to do it without their becoming scofflaws, or without their having millions of dollars to hire infinite numbers of trackers and lawyers.   Now, that's the argument that's made on the other side, as the interest in communication that's important.   What do you say? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " So -- two points.   First, with respect to the interest in what foreign countries will do, I think it's incorrect to assume that this will be tit-for-tat, that if we don't enforce Article 18, the only thing other countries won't do is enforce Article 18 with respect to our works, as opposed to believing that we're not an -- an effective partner and not enforcing their copyright laws for the whole purpose of our works.   Second, Justice Breyer, that problem that you identified just exists as a feature of copyright law.   Copyright law exists for a certain time.   With respect to those works, it's going to create that issue.   The problem here is just the result of a fortuity that those works might have been published in a country that at the time they were published didn't have copyright relations with the United States.   And what section 514 does is address that fortuity by putting those authors in the same position they would have been in had their country had copyright relations with the United States.   So I don't think that's a principled objection on a constitutional basis-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Right here, we have the argument.   I agree with you that it is a general problem.   It may be diminished in the United States but it still exists.   And I guess the argument here is well, don't make it millions of times worse.

It is the case, Justice Ginsburg, that if you're not a reliance party, then there would be an infringement even without notice, so I do think there is something on that point.   But again, I just think that's a result of the fortuity of the countries not having copyright relations with the United States.   It's not about the -- it's not anything integral as a matter of constitutional principle -- the statute-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " --Marbury -- the Davis law was passed.   Had to go and pick out all the books it had that were subject to copyright and throw them out, or do what with them? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B.

I don't think that they had -- I don't think -- I don't think there is an active infringement by having a library book on the shelf, and of course, there are protections for libraries built into the Copyright Act in all events.   And I do -- if I could in my remaining time, I want to go back to the history that we started with, because I do think it is important that there is no -- as a matter of text, I think it's clear -- there is no unyielding requirement that you cannot restore copyright to works in the public domain.   I think the history really does bear that out.   I think Justice Sotomayor had the history exactly right, that in 1790, you had three states with no copyright statutes.   Of the 10 states with copyright statutes, you had seven that did not provide copyright to maps and charts, which the Federal statute did.   And I think this is the key point: Of the states that did enact copyright statutes to -- in the 1780s in advance of the 1790 Federal Act -- at least four, and depending on how you counted -- as many as eight provided copyright protection only to works printed after the date of the State statute.   They did that at the urging of the Continental Congress in 1783.   So I don't think there is any doubt that when Congress enacted the Copyright Act of 1790, it made a conscious choice to take a different approach, to grant copyright protection to existing works, including many, many, many works that were freely available for exploitation in those states. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Doesn't that show at most that retroactive protection can be granted when there is an enormous interest in doing so, namely, the establishment of the uniform copyright system at the beginning of the country, because if Congress had not done that and had said the alternative would be to say things can be copyrighted going forward, then you would have different copyright laws in all of the States? "}, {"speaker": "Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.", "text": " I think -- I don't think so, Justice Alito.   I think they could have followed the model nationally of prospective copyright only, and extinguishing the prior copyright, but they didn't make that choice.   They made a different choice.   Now, my friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a transition, but of course, the same thing is really true in an important sense of section 514.   It's part of a tradition of a transition of the United States into the international system, which has required an adjustment of our rules in order to bring us into conformity with the international system.   And beyond the example of course of the 1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in the 1790 copyright who have or have not copyright, that's just a rerun of an argument that the Court rejected in Wheaton v. Peters.   In Wheaton, the Court said that -- that language in the 1790 Act was referring to pre-publication common law copyright, not post-publication common law copyright.   Beyond that, it seems to me pretty clear that what that language is referring to -- of course, Congress presupposes the existence of copyrights, or at least State statutes that created some copyrights -- but what Congress did was act far more broadly.   And -- so I do think -- and then when one looks at the examples of patents -- I think the -- the Oliver Evans example, and that case, is an important example, early in our history.   Congress creates a new patent term to an expired patent.   President Jefferson signs it.   Secretary of State Madison issues it.   Chief Justice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and the Court upholds it against a charge that it's impermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on the expiration of the prior patent.   There wasn't a word in this Court's decision in that case about any potential constitutional infirmity with doing that.   And one would think if this was such a significant and viable principle of constitutional law, that someone would have brought it up in those cases.   In fact, the striking thing about reading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly looks at this all as a matter of legislative policy judgment.   It says, you know yes, you're right, it might have been an argument, a good argument in favor of creating some reliance interest here, but that's a judgment Congress should have made if anybody was going to make it.   It didn't -- and there is no reading of the -- there is no required reading of that statute that has to protect the reliance party.   So I don't -- I just think when you look at the patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act, when you consider the fact that when Congress expands exclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to musical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with respect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with existing copyrights.   And all of that points up to the wisdom of what this court said in Eldred, that within very wide margins, these are matters where legislative choice, these are policy calls that require the balancing of a complex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set of lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact that we are now trying to make a transition into full participation in an international system, which is of vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable economic exports, intellectual property.

Point number two, this statute does not and cannot promote progress, that is, the creation and spread of knowledge and learning.   When we joined Berne in 1988 we got all of its prospective benefits, or as the government put it, secured the highest available level of multilateral copyright protection for U.S. artists, authors and their creators.   This statute is not about that.   It's simply about rewarding people who made things long ago.   It's-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " At the time we joined Berne, there was an appreciation that we deferred the article 18 issue.   There wasn't any -- anyone who said that we satisfied it. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " --No.   There was an express finding -- explicit finding written into the statute, that -- and Congress found explicitly that we could comply with all Berne obligations without removing anything from the public domain.   Now, third point-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Well there were many people who read article 18 in a different way and Congress was later persuaded that that was right. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " --Congress never revisited that finding.   So no; they found what they found in 1988, and they never revisited it. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " They -- they found that compliance with article 18 was appropriate for us to become a full member of the international copyright community. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " Congress did not make that finding, and I don't think you can even glean that from the testimony that was presented to Congress.   The problem here is -- the -- the -- the right to use works in the public domain has defined the freedom of speech that the public has known since 1790.   The 1790 Act made these freedoms clear by placing works unambiguously and clearly in the public domain, including all foreign works.   So even since before we had a First Amendment, that has defined the freedom of speech that the public knew.   And that right has also made sure that the copyright sequence provides ever-increasing protection for public speech rights.   It gives partial protection for some public speech interests during any initial period of protection, but that blossoms into complete protection for all public speech interests, once we reach the limit Congress picks, once they place the work in the public domain.   The burden on speech that this statute imposes is remarkable.   Let's start with the performance right, which is central to my clients.   There can't be any doubt, as I think Chief Justice Roberts got at, that the performance has a huge amount of original expression bound up in it.   It's the reason it's different to see King Lear at the Royal Shakespeare Company; it's the reason it's different when John Coltrane plays a jazz standard.   Hume amount of expression.   But even if you put performances aside, this Court has recognized in case after case that there is a critical speech interest in publishing the work of another author, in showing a film created by another, or for that matter performing the work of another, so that the burden here is it took speech rights of 250 million Americans and turned them into the private property of foreign authors, all on the bare possibility that might put more money in the pocket of some U.S. authors. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " All this rides on accepting your argument that zero is a limited time. "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " No.   Not on the First Amendment side.   Not at all.   That is -- the First Amendment argument is completely independent of that.   Even if you find Congress could do this on the Copyright Clause, we still have that First Amendment problem, and the -- there is no way the government can pass intermediate scrutiny here.   This was not required by Berne.   The government does not even contend Section 514 was required by Berne, nor could it, because that would violate Congress's explicit findings they made in 1988. "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " Would you say it was would required by TRIPS? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " No.   Because TRIPS just implements Berne.   So that the problem here is this statute was not passed-- "}, {"speaker": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "text": " We do not solve them if we don't come ply with Berne 18, and we are subject to being sanctioned by some World Trade Organization? "}, {"speaker": "Anthony T. Falzone", "text": " --There was very vague testimony about the unsupported possibility that could happen, and that's why the government falls back on this interest of avoiding a dispute.   Here is the problem.   If the government can get around First Amendment limits by signing a treaty, and then the flexibility to take away public speech rights is defined by some complaint proffered by some treaty partner, then the First Amendment is defined only by the perceptions, the complaints and frankly the imagination of foreign countries.   That can't be the way it works. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
