That was the underlying-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If that's where it comes from, then it does relate to a kind of estimate, doesn't it? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Maddrey", "text": " --Historically it does.   It's been the policy of the State of North Carolina for almost a century, as I referenced the lien statutes that apply generally to -- to tort actions, to civil recoveries, to protect the providers of medical services, and those cases date back to 1935. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Can I ask you a somewhat technical -- and I appreciate your paying attention because it's hard for me to keep all this in my mind.   All right.   It's my understanding of North Carolina, everyone accepts the rule and North Carolina agrees that if you in -- in North Carolina advance to the victim $50,000 in medical expenses -- now, you're never going to get more than that back and you don't want more than that back.   Now, the victim and the tortfeasor enter into a settlement and you have a rule and the rule is you will never get more than 50,000 or 33 percent, whichever is less.   That's the rule, whichever is less.   So if the settlement is for $100,000, you are not going to take more than 33, so you have advanced 50.   Okay.   So you have basically three situations.   The first situation is where a judge has said, you know what, I find that only $10,000 of this settlement is for medical expenses.   In that case you take $10,000, no more.   Is that right? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Maddrey", "text": " No, Your Honor. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Oh.   I got the impression that if there was a judicial -- there are three situations: One is there is a judicial finding that only 10 percent was medical.   And the second is the situation where they stipulate that only 10 percent is for medical, and the third situation is this situation, namely there is no stipulation and there is no judicial finding.   So my thought, which is wrong I guess, is if the judge says it's 10 percent you won't take more than 10 percent, but if in fact it's a stipulation of 10 percent North Carolina courts have not yet decided that, and this is a case where there is no stipulation and no judicial finding.   Now you're telling me I have that wrong.   So you explain what the North Carolina is on that, because I think it makes quite a difference. "}, {"speaker": "John F.

Breyer", "text": " I know, but in the settlement they stipulate that 10 percent is for medical and the rest for pain and suffering.   Now, I thought North Carolina courts have not yet decided whether North Carolina -- which would like more than 10 percent -- can get it.   Is that true or not true? "}, {"speaker": "John F.

Ahlborn we all agree says you cannot get more than medical, the medical expense, okay?   The question here is how to figure that.   So I thought that one way to figure it -- I will just be repeating myself.   One way to figure it is how much of this $100,000 settlement is attributable to medical expenses as a judge would say.   Now, you're telling me there is a case in North Carolina which says if the judge himself says that 10 percent of the settlement is for medical, that's not what California -- that doesn't matter according to North Carolina law, and I'd like the name of the case, the State case that says that.

As to the anti-lien provision of the Medicaid Act, if the statute defines the amount of medicals as 230 -- excuse me -- two-thirds, that would present the same analysis under the anti-lien provision of the Medicaid Act.   The difference would be whether the State could show a rational basis in its tort law, in its jurisprudence. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " I guess I'm not sure I got that.   In other words, I'm assuming an amendment that just all it does is it changes one-third to two-thirds.   And so your theory it seems to me would work the exact same way.   Then you say: Well, you need a rational basis for doing that.   But I thought you told me that the one-third really doesn't have anything to do with an estimate of how much is medical and how much is not medical.   So it seems that you would have the same basis to say two-thirds as you do to say one-third.   Am I wrong about that? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Maddrey", "text": " I would say, Justice Kagan, the reason it's not the same is that it would treat Medicaid recipients decidedly differently than other tort litigants in North Carolina.   Given the 1935 history of the allocation of -- of tort settlements and the liens in favor of the providers of medical care that preexist the North Carolina Medicaid statute, if you then change the Medicaid statute-- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But you're saying there's a kind of side constraint, that Medicaid recipients have to be treated like others, but then presumably, the State could change everybody's? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Maddrey", "text": " --I -- I believe that would be the case, yes.   The -- the question would be whether there was any disparate treatment, any singling out of -- of a Medicaid recipient.   And certainly, we've demonstrated that under the -- the North Carolina experience, that is not the case.

I don't understand that.   You see, I think the only way you can defend it is that -- is that the recipient never -- never had a property right.   Once -- once recovery is given to the recipient, the recovery does not belong to the recipient.   And if that's true for 33 percent, it can be true for 100 percent.   Has there ever been any litigation since 1935 about takings problems, with -- with the State requiring 33 percent to go to the medical provider, even though it may well be that less or more of that amount went to medical damages?

Maddrey", "text": " --Your Honor, under the general lien statutes in Chapter 44 of the North Carolina general statutes, Sections 49 and 50 are the two provisions that we cite.   I'm not aware of any takings-related challenges to those laws.   I am aware of State supreme court opinions saying that the attorney had to distribute proceeds in accordance with the statute. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Can I go back for a second?   Because I want to show you where I got my perhaps mistaken idea from.   There is a case called Andrews.   And there is a statement in Andrews, which is a South -- North Carolina case -- which says in certain circumstances, although the statute says just what Justice Scalia says, the lawyer sits there, he takes one-third and pays it to the State.   Then this case has this sentence in it:   \"Ahlborn controls when there has been a prior determination or stipulation as to the medical expense portion of a plaintiff's settlement. \"   \"In those cases, the State may not receive reimbursement in excess of the portion so designated. \"   Now, having read that sentence, I thought the law of North Carolina was that this statute does not apply, and that when, in fact, the jury or the judge finds that only 10 percent was for medical expenses, the State cannot take more than 10 percent.   And the same is true of a stipulation.   That's what those words seem to say to me.   Now you're telling me that I'm not reading those words correctly, the case of Andrews does not affect our case here, and that you -- that the law of North Carolina is that you get one-third.   Now, what is it?   Do you see why I am confused? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Maddrey", "text": " Yes, Your Honor.   I will try -- try, if I can, to explain what I believe to be the source of the confusion is.

It came in the Federal court action to challenge Arkansas's imposition of its lien. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " I see. "}, {"speaker": "John F.

But if you actually turn to the Fourth Circuit's decision, which is based on the briefs that were filed in the Fourth Circuit, in the petition at page 20A, the rule of thumb is actually three times specials, which of course is different than three times medicals, because special damages would include things like lost wages and various other things. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Browning, let me give you a different rationale for this statute.   It's different than the one the State suggests, but it would go something like this:   There is an allocation that has to be made.   In making allocations there are two ways of doing it.   We can do it case-by-case, individualized decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules.   And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking, because in individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too.   So this is a reasonable way to make an allocation decision.   And nothing that we said in Ahlborn suggests that a State needs to use case-by case decisionmaking rather than bright-line rules to make the allocation that it needs to make between medical and nonmedical damages.   What about that? "}, {"speaker": "Christopher G. Browning, Jr.", "text": " Well, Your Honor, I would turn to the language of the Ahlborn decision which makes clear that States cannot lay claim to more than a portion of a settlement or judgment that represents payment for medical care or medical expenses.   When you have-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes, but that doesn't answer the question.   I mean that portion, according to North Carolina, is one-third.

Browning, Jr.", "text": " --It is the State saying it is one-third even though there is no basis and even though you have cases like this where it's clearly not one-third-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Yes, but what the State says is the law.   I mean, the State says one-third is for medical. "}, {"speaker": "Christopher G. Browning, Jr.", "text": " --Your Honor, if that is all North Carolina had to do, of course, the Ahlborn decision would have been dramatically different if Arkansas had simply enacted a cap of 100 percent or 50 percent or 40 percent, because in the Ahlborn decision, the State of Arkansas was only seeking to recover 39 percent of the tort settlement.   And under North Carolina's theory, if Arkansas had simply been bright enough to implement a cap, the Ahlborn decision would have been completely different.   And that makes absolutely no sense.   I think the Ahlborn decision indicates that there has to be a process in order to fairly and appropriately determine the amount that the State may-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " So you need, ultimately you need an adjudication.   You have to leave it either to a jury to decide what percentage of the total award is medical expenses or have a separate proceeding.   Let's say where there has been a settlement, you need a separate proceeding to decide how much of it is really for medical.   You know, they may say 10 percent is, but who believes that?   You need a proceeding.   That is awfully time-consuming.   And as Justice Kagan suggests, I'm not sure it's going to be very accurate.   I don't think a jury determination is going to be -- is going to be accurate on that score.   And I don't know how you go about determining how much of a settlement is attributable to medical expenses versus other things, especially when the settlement itself says only 10 percent is medical expenses.

The problem is it can't be an irrebuttable presumption. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " How does it work?   Because I would imagine at the negotiation you have the victim's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer is interested that the bottom line number be as low as possible and the victim's number, that it be as high as possible.   And the victim's lawyer in fact would like as little as possible to be allocated to a source which is going to take that money away from him.   So they can reach agreement.   What they will do is say 1 penny is for medical expenses and everything else is for pain and suffering, and that's very good for the victim.   And it's irrelevant to the tortfeasor.   So when you see that on a piece of paper, what is it you are going to do?   What kind of proceeding are you going to have?   It's a proceeding about a proceeding.   It's a proceeding about the settlement negotiation.   What's it going to look like?   What does it look like in the 16 States?   We will have a plaintiff's lawyer testify.   He will say, Your Honor, I really wanted 1 penny and only 1 penny to be allocated to pain and -- to medical expense.

Obviously, it would be different than the scenario that we have here, but it does -- the starting point has to be the anti-lien provision, which is no lien may be imposed.   This Court in Ahlborn assumed without deciding that there would be an implied exception to that statute.   But that -- that exception is very limited.

So, in a situation such as yours where the total recovery is -- is not going to suffice to cover both pain and suffering and medical expenses, it'd be very intelligent to do what Justice Alito proposed.

Often, there will be no shared intent.   What -- what the States are doing is determining what the appropriate allocation should be.   And the States that have individualized determinations, which is what we think is required here, have developed a number of different procedures for doing that.   For instance, a district court in Pennsylvania, in McKinney-- "}, {"speaker": "Antonin Scalia", "text": " Excuse me.   I have a -- I have a theoretical problem right at the outset.

They're looking to determine what proportion should have been for medical expenses.   How does that tie in with the -- with the prohibition of the lien? "}, {"speaker": "Ginger D. Anders", "text": " --Well, I think this Court established in Ahlborn that the beneficiary and the State, they respectively have interests in the settlement that arises from the fact that in the tort case the plaintiff has asserted claims for medical damages and for nonmedical damages.   And so Ahlborn establishes that we need to divide the two in order to determine what the State may recover.   Ahlborn also establishes that the beneficiary has an interest in the settlement that arises from her nonmedical claims that can be allocated away by an allocation method, such as one that gives -- that says that 100 percent of the settlement must always be allocated to -- to medical damages.

But we do know, because the plaintiff, the beneficiary, has asserted nonmedical claims and she has compromised them, we do know that she has an interest in the settlement that arises from her nonmedical claims.   So for instance, you can imagine the situation in which a plaintiff has a claim that is 10 percent medical damages and 90 percent lost -- past lost wages.   So they're both equally concrete.   In that situation, when the plaintiff settles for pennies on the dollar, I think we would have serious questions about whether a one-third allocation to medical damages in that case would be appropriate.

So the individual beneficiary can try to rebut it, but the States could as well?   Or is it just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the presumption? "}, {"speaker": "Ginger D. Anders", "text": " I think in those States, it's just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the presumption.   Some of those States start with a rebuttable presumption of full reimbursement.   So -- so the presumption starts at the full amount that the State paid. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So this is a real, significant increase in the burden on the State under the Medicaid program.   You're saying yes, you can try to recover recovery from third-party tortfeasors, but if you do that you've got to set up this apparatus where everybody can come in and you've got to prove what the allocation was and all that.   So -- I mean some -- 34 States haven't done that, right? "}, {"speaker": "Ginger D. Anders", "text": " I think what's more significant for our purposes is that 16 States plus D.C. have, and-- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, yes, for your purposes.   But I'm interested in my purposes.   And I'm trying to figure out whether or not that's a significant financial burden on the State -- if they're going to go about trying to recover this money, that they've got to provide some apparatus, administrative, judicial, whatever, to make a calculation that I still don't understand what it's addressed to.   And not only that, but even if you do know what it's addressed to, you just take into account all these things and come up with an equitable. "}, {"speaker": "Ginger D. Anders", "text": " --I don't think that these States have found that it's a significant administrative burden.   One reason is that once the allocation rules are in place, it's our understanding that most of these cases settle.   The beneficiary and the State agree as to what the allocation is, so this doesn't go to a hearing in the first place.   But even -- even when there are hearings, I think States can take significant measures to lessen the burden.   For instance-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " How many States have North Carolina's rule?   Do you know? "}, {"speaker": "Ginger D. Anders", "text": " --There are -- there are five other States like North Carolina that have an irrebuttable presumption with a cap.   There are 10 others that have an irrebuttable presumption, we think, of full reimbursement.   But I should caveat that by saying that we simply don't know in those States what they do, what their practices are. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Why isn't -- the missing part here -- maybe I just missed it -- we're interpreting a statute, and the part that trumps the lien provision is the part that says the State is entitled to payment that has been made for medical assistance for health care items -- and some other similar language is in the statute.   They think their one-third rule is a good way of measuring that.   You think that the one-third rule as a rebuttable presumption is a better way of measuring that.   Now normally, or often, I would see government arguments like that where they'd say: And by the way, we're interpreting very technical language in our statute, and Chevron and/or Skidmore means that you should give us particular weight.   Is that part of your argument here, and if it isn't, why isn't it? "}, {"speaker": "Ginger D. Anders", "text": " Well, we think that -- the position reflected in our brief is HHS's considered position, and we do think that it's -- it is persuasive.   Now, HHS presumably could regulate, it could go through notice and comment rulemaking and establish rules-- "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " My impression is that you get Chevron deference on the basis of whether Congress -- and there's a lot of rules and so forth, that-- "}, {"speaker": "Ginger D.

So, I, you know, I admire you're not citing Chevron. "}, {"speaker": "Ginger D. Anders", "text": " Well, HHS has -- the statute requires the States to -- to enact reasonable measures for recovery.   HHS thinks that a measure that circumvents the anti-lien provision like North Carolina's wouldn't be a reasonable measure, but there aren't regulations on that subject. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   General Maddrey, you have three minutes remaining. "}, {"speaker": "John F. Maddrey", "text": " We have heard a lot about what a State could or maybe should do, but what must a State do under the Medicaid Act to fulfill its obligations?   The Fourth Circuit and respondents and apparently the United States say they have to have a post-settlement trial, I guess a trial to settle the settlement.   And that, while an available option, is not a mandatory requirement under anything that I can see in the Medicaid Act. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, General, how about this, and I am having a little bit of trouble here because I think a State could come in, or I think there is a reasonable argument that a State could come in and say, you know, we've made an estimate, and here's our best estimate, and we don't think there is a need for an individualized decisionmaking on top of that.   But as I understand your argument, that is not what you are saying.   You are making a very different kind of argument, suggesting that you can take this number any place, no matter what the relationship between the number and the actual allocation that cases -- that allocation of medical and nonmedical damages in the real world.   So if that's the case, what do I do? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Maddrey", "text": " Your Honor, the statute -- North Carolina's statute defines the amount that must be included for the repayment by the Medicaid recipient.   It's not guessing after the fact, but instead providing in advance, the recipe as to how to put the settlement together.   It tells the parties what they have to do.   And that makes it a bright-line rule, which I think you need to compare to the alternative, which is this -- this, what the Fourth Circuit called a true value hearing after the fact, after the settlement, how did -- how did they get there?   Is it what they did or what they should have done or what they could have done?   In this case you've got a $42 million damage claim settled for 2.8 million-- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " So how do -- what do we do with the Federal statute that says, You are not entitled to a lien of any amount that is greater than your medical expenses?   And using the Solicitor General's Office example, everybody knows that the true value of medical expenses in a particular case was only 10 percent, you are still getting 30 percent.   How do we -- how do we honor the terms of the Federal statute? "}, {"speaker": "John F. Maddrey", "text": " --Because the State statute says the State never recovers more than its actual medical expenses.   If in that hypothetical the medical expenses were 100,000 or 10 percent, the North Carolina statute would say North Carolina gets up to one-third of the settlement but never more than they paid.   So by definition it can't be for something that was not medicals.   And that's the bright-line rule that the North Carolina statute creates. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel.   The case is submitted. "}]
