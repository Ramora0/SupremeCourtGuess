[{"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-532, Herrera versus Wyoming. Mr. Hicks. "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1868, the Crow Tribe of Indians agreed to cede to the United States 30 million acres of its aboriginal land and move to a reservation.   In exchange for ceding its land, the tribe expressly reserved the right to hunt on that ceded land. The text of the 1868 treaty memorializing this agreement explicitly identifies the four events that would cause the hunting right to terminate.   Wyoming's admission to the Union is not among them. Therefore, the only way that Wyoming's statehood could have terminated the hunting right is by implication, but that is the very theory that this Court repeatedly rejected in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians. And while the treaty does provide that the right would terminate if the lands were no longer unoccupied, President Cleveland's 1897 proclamation creating the Bighorn National Forest did not suddenly render all 1.1 million acres of the land comprising the forest occupied as the parties to the treaty understood that term. As a result, the treaty right has not terminated, and Petitioner should have been permitted to invoke that right during his criminal prosecution for hunting in the Bighorn National Forest. Before this Court, Wyoming largely disregards Mille Lacs and urges this Court to rely on its 1896 decision in Ward v. Race Horse.   But Mille Lacs repudiated the reasoning that led to the outcome in Race Horse.   From Race Horse's reliance on the equal footing doctrine to its characterization of treaty rights as temporary and precarious -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " But -- "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " -- to its belief that states -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Even if you were right about Race Horse, why isn't your client bound by the judgment of the Tenth Circuit in Repsis and, in particular, its disposition of the question whether the land is occupied? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Justice Alito, a few responses for that. First of all, the -- the issue of whether the Tenth Circuit's alternative determination has preclusive effect was not pressed or passed on below.   There's nothing in the decisions of the state courts that address the preclusive effect of that alternative determination.   And this Court typically does not address questions from state courts that have not been pressed or passed on. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " So that -- that would be available to the state to argue on remand if you were to prevail on the other issues? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, I think that the -- the state has likely forfeited that as a matter of state law, but I also think that there are other reasons why an exception to preclusion would not apply.   I mean -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " What's your best reason? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Primarily, it's that the tribe did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate this issue in Repsis because it was not raised in the Repsis district court.   It was raised for the first time in the court of appeals, and the court of appeals' determination in the first instance was not only one of several alternative determinations; it wasn't subject to plenary appellate review. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, those are several reasons.   The -- there was not a fair opportunity to raise the issue in the Tenth Circuit? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, I think that there was not the full and fair opportunity to litigate that question that this Court requires before it gives preclusive effect. "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Why -- why not? Why not in the Tenth Circuit? Why didn't they have a fair and -- a full and fair opportunity in the Tenth Circuit? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, to begin with, I don't know if the full -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " They didn't allow briefs? They didn't allow arguments? They didn't want to listen to anything that -- that the tribe had to say? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, primarily because this particular argument, that the creation of the national forest in and of itself rendered the entire land occupied so that the treaty right was terminated, was, I believe, one page of Wyoming's response brief in -- on an issue that was never raised in the district court. And so the only thing that the tribe had to respond to that was limited space in a reply brief where it had to respond to all of the other arguments that Wyoming had made, principally on the issue that the district court had actually addressed. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Could you -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Mr. Hicks, are -- are you asking us to decide that issue, or are you asking us to remand on that issue? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " I think there are several reasons why you can decide that there was no preclusive effect to the Tenth Circuit's determination, among them, that it was forfeited; among them, that it was not a full and fair opportunity so that it qualifies for that exception, but also that that particular determination in the first instance was not subject to the plenary appellate review this Court requires. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " If -- if -- if your primary argument is that it was forfeited, and I think you -- you have some good grounds for thinking that, but given that that is a state law matter, why wouldn't we remand to the Wyoming courts to decide that forfeiture question? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, because I think typically what this Court does when a -- an issue has not been raised or pressed on below is it -- is it doesn't allow the consideration of it here.   So I don't think there's any reason to remand for consideration of that in the first instance. But I think you can go on to address that, you know, as a matter of an exception to preclusion law.   I mean, I think that there are several reasons why that wouldn't be given preclusive effect. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " I'm a little confused.   What was forfeited when? You didn't -- you -- you're arguing you didn't get a fair and full opportunity to litigate this in Repsis? In Repsis, there wasn't a fair opportunity? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " That -- it is that the tribe did not have the required full and fair opportunity, among the reasons, in the Tenth Circuit.

"}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I'll tell you what troubles me about your position here and your argument that we should decide these issue preclusion questions.   This is like a little -- you know, a couple of classes in law school on issue preclusion, and you and the -- and the -- the government have raised significant issue preclusion arguments that we're going to have to decide in this case involving a misdemeanor criminal conviction. "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, Justice Alito, I think those are actually good reasons to find that there are -- you can apply the well-established exceptions.   I mean, the full and fair opportunity -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, I don't know that they are well -- I don't know that they are well established.   The exception that when a judgment is raised it is based on two alternative grounds, it's not -- there's no issue preclusion on either ground, that's well established? Hasn't that been rejected by six circuits? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " No, Your -- Your Honor, that is incorrect.   Actually, if you look at the footnote in our reply brief, seven circuits have actually accepted the Restatement's rule. I know that the State's brief says -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " Well, we haven't accepted it, have we? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " No, this Court has not addressed it, but it actually goes part and parcel with what this Court has said about the -- the critical importance of giving plenary -- plenary appellate review to determinations. That is the premise -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " I mean, it seems to me like a significant question, and I was underwhelmed by the reasons given in the comment to the provision of the Restatement on this question. "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, I think that -- first of all, I don't -- "}, {"speaker": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", "text": " The first reason they give is that when -- when a court says our judgment, right, is based on two alternative grounds, and either one is independently sufficient, that shouldn't have -- that shouldn't have res judicata -- that shouldn't have issue preclusion effect because, really, the -- the court may not have seriously -- the court may not have been accurate in saying each one is independently sufficient. Do you find that to -- do you find that to be a particularly strong argument? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, I think that it's a -- it's an exception that applies in narrow circumstances.   You have to have an alternative determination decided in the first instance. And I think that, frankly, the Tenth Circuit's decision here proves the policy underlying it. I mean, I don't -- there's not a great defense of the Tenth Circuit's determination on the merits.   And I think that's demonstrated by the fact that there was such limited briefing. It was only raised in the Tenth Circuit in one page of briefing. The tribe, you know, only had a very limited amount of its reply brief.   So I think when you combine, you know, the policies underlying the full and fair opportunity, in addition to the fact that it's an alternative determination in the first instance, I think the Tenth Circuit's determination is, you know, demonstrating why the Restatement exception exists. And, again, it's a very -- "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel -- counsel, I'll spot you that.   I mean, it's a little curious that -- now I don't wish to fault my old court, but the Tenth Circuit decided that the land was occupied by the federal government as an alternative holding without hearing from the federal government, who now disclaims the idea that they occupied the territory. So I -- I -- I take your point.   But do we have to get into any of this issue preclusion stuff at all? If this issue wasn't raised by the district, passed on by the district court, relied on by the district court, in this proceeding, why should we enmesh ourselves in the excellent Wyoming law of issue preclusion? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, Justice Gorsuch, I -- I don't think you need to get into that.   I think you can advance to the merits and decide the merits questions before you. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Let's do that then. Tell us about that. "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " I -- I -- I would be happy to do that, because, you know, if you go back to this Court's decision in Mille Lacs and you look at the reasoning that this Court put forward for the -- for what constitutes termination of Indian treaty rights -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But in that -- in that decision, we did not overrule Race Horse. We said that Race Horse meant that statehood did not automatically terminate the prior treaty right, automatically, but that certain language in the Race Horse treaty was still sufficient to terminate the treaty right.   And the language in the Race Horse treaty is the exact same language at issue in this treaty. What's -- so why shouldn't we have the same result here that we had in Race Horse, and that's the part of Race Horse that is preserved on page 207 by Mille Lacs? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh, I -- I don't think you expressly overruled the outcome in Race Horse, but I think that you did reject all the legal reasoning that led to the Race Horse results.

You rejected the temporary and precarious approach to characterizing treaty rights, which was a premise of that second -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But -- but we -- sorry to interrupt.   We concluded that it was a question of congressional intent, whether the treaty right was terminated by statehood, and we concluded that the language, the right to hunt on unoccupied lands of the United States, was the relevant treaty language, was terminated by Wyoming's statehood, correct?

And my question is, if that part of Race Horse was not overruled but was explicitly preserved and, in fact, distinguished from the Chippewa treaty, how can we in this case not apply the same result that was applied in Race Horse, with the exact same treaty language? Which part of the reasoning is wrong there? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " A couple of responses. First of all, I don't know that you would be applying the results of a prior case. I think you apply your reasoning.   And I think that the reasoning that you adopted in the Race Horse -- I'm sorry, in Mille Lacs was that you did not accept this idea that -- that simply characterizing a treaty right as temporary and precarious, such that it could be impliedly terminated by statehood -- and I recognize that you distinguished -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M.

You recognized the holding that Congress did not intend for that particular treaty right to -- to survive statehood. But then you went on.

Wouldn't we have to say that Race Horse is overruled to come to a different conclusion? How would we distinguish the two? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, I think -- I think that you simply need to apply the reasoning that you set forth, the new reasoning in Mille Lacs, to this Crow Tribe treaty, which has never been before the Court.

Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, I can -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " -- that would distinguish them sufficient for us to say we're applying the new logic and this treaty provision fits that new logic, plus it's different from Race Horse, why? You haven't filled in that blank. "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Sure.   And -- and I would say that, you know, first of all, I think it would be far more unusual not to apply your controlling precedent on Indian treaty termination, termination of Indian treaty rights, to a treaty that has never been before this Court simply because there's old reasoning to a treaty that has not been before the Court. But if you're looking for distinctions between the treaties, of course, this Court has said, including in Mille Lacs itself, that you don't just look to the identical text of two treaties.   You look at the negotiations.   You look at the history.   You look at the post-ratification history. And as we've put forward in our brief, there is nothing in either the text or the negotiations or the post-ratification history that gives any indication that statehood would have been a terminating event. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " What's different about the Crow treaty, which is 1868, and the Shoshone treaty, 1868, in terms of the negotiations or the intent? The language is exactly the same.   So what's different about the intent? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, we don't know much about the negotiations or the history of the Shoshone-Bannock treaty because that really wasn't addressed much in the Race Horse decision, but there are -- there are material distinctions between the history in the way that these treaties came about. For example -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " These two treaties? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " For the -- the -- the Race Horse treaty, the Shoshone-Bannock treaty, and the Crow Tribe treaty. The Shoshone-Bannock were on the complete other side of Wyoming.   The treaty came about because of different conflicts with settlers. The -- the Crow Tribe is on the complete other side of Wyoming.   It's nowhere near Yellowstone National Park, which was something that the -- the Race Horse Court was looking at as well. I mean, there are material distinctions between the way that these two treaties came to be because of the different histories between the two tribes. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But you haven't pointed to anything really specific.   My concern just is -- is just that if we end up with agreeing with you on the merits, we'll have a result that the same treaty language creates two different results, one for the Shoshone ends at statehood, the treaty right, and the other does not for this, the Crow, even though it's the exact same treaty language. And I'd like, if we're going to reach that result, to be able to point to something. And what is that something? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Justice Kavanaugh, I think that if -- if there are different results there, I think that's a consequence of the new reasoning that you set out in Mille Lacs.   And I think it would be far more unusual not to apply -- "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " But that would have been -- sorry to interrupt.   That would have been a reason on page 207 to say the Race Horse decision is gone.   And that's not what we said.   We distinguished the treaty language. And maybe we should have said it's gone, but we didn't. "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Well, I certainly think that if it gives you heartburn to have two different results because you're applying your latest legal reasoning, I think you can take the extra step. You did so in the Limbach case that we -- that we cited, in the Sunnen case.   I mean, these are examples where, you know, Limbach actually says so there -- so that there may be no misunderstanding, we hereby expressly overrule this decision that's -- you know, that we probably should have just expressly overruled before.   So -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, how much are you going to have to unwind if you apply -- you no longer believe that statehood eliminated the treaty provisions in Race Horse? "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Nothing, Your Honor, because there's -- there's no other state that has to -- that is operating under this. There's no other state aside from Wyoming that has been free of recognizing Indian treaty rights. So that's not a consideration.   And there's been no suggestion or evidence that Wyoming has ever relied on this particular Race Horse treaty in the way that it has formulated its -- its natural resource management or in the way that it -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, you'd still have the result that concerns Justice Kavanaugh, that under the exact same language, the two different tribes are going to be treated differently. "}, {"speaker": "George W.

"}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " The government would be fine with that.   We would invite the Court to overrule Race Horse.   I do want to make clear that, in our view, it's not necessary to take that extra step.   Even though these two treaties have the same language, this is a different treaty than the treaty that was before this Court in Race Horse.   It governs a different tribe on different lands. And so I think this Court is still faced with the question, even though the language is the same, about whether to extend the erroneous reasoning of Race Horse to a new context. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Would you please stop talking in generalities? "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " Oh, sure. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Give me a specific in which way are the two tribes or their history different? "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " Well, Your Honor, to be frank, I -- I don't think there -- the government isn't going to be able to point to a difference in the history.   We just think Race Horse itself was wrong. But I think the question is still, should you extend that reasoning to a new context? You know, one of the -- one of the reasons you might want to extend it is this -- this interest in uniformity, but I think it's important to remember that that -- that uniformity rationale just isn't going to work here. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribe, which was the tribe involved in the Race Horse decision, has its reservation in Idaho.   And the Idaho Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit for decades have said Race Horse is already a dead letter. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Why do you think Race Horse wasn't over -- overruled? "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " I think for the simple reason, Justice Kagan, that the Race Horse treaty just wasn't before the Court in Mille Lacs and -- "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, but it does try to distinguish it.   Now I have to say I've read that paragraph three times, and I still really have no idea what it's talking about. (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But it does try to distinguish it.   It has this view that there are two kinds of rights and -- and some are -- two kinds of termination points for a treaty, and some are clearly contemplated and some aren't. What it never tells you is how that distinction relates at all to the statehood question that's before us and that was before Mille Lacs.   But -- but it does -- there's something in its head about how these treaties are different and why that matters. And I guess I'm looking to you to tell me what I don't understand about it. "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " I think you're right, Justice Kagan.   That middle sentence and, I think, the paragraph that -- that troubles all of us is a distinction between the 1868 treaty that was at issue in Race Horse and the -- and the 1837 treaty that was at issue in Mille Lacs. But, number one, I -- I think it's important to read that sentence within the context of everything around it, and I -- and I think everything around it makes clear that the reasoning in Race Horse is no longer good. Even that sentence itself doesn't provide any affirmative reason why Race Horse was correct. As you noted, it's just a -- a grounds for distinguishing Race Horse.   So you couldn't look at that sentence and say Race Horse actually reached the right result.   In fact, if you look at the terminating events that those two sentences themselves identify as terminating events under the treaty in Race Horse, statehood isn't one of those either. It focuses on the text.   It focuses on -- on whether the land is unoccupied and still owned by the United States.   That actually flows nicely from the beginning of that paragraph, which says that the inquiry should be on the circumstances that the treaty itself identifies. So I think, read as a whole, this paragraph is about what the proper focus of the inquiry should be. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Counsel, you are -- for the government, you are walking a really thin tightrope here.   You're saying that in terms of whether the land is occupied, it depends on the real question whether there are settlers there, whether there are people there. And yet you say when it comes to the Bighorn National Forest or park, you say, well, maybe it's occupied if we, the government, say we don't want people coming on here. It seems to me that the test has to be the same for the United States' property at Bighorn and for the other property in Wyoming. "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " I -- I think that's right, Mr. Chief Justice.   We're not asking that a different test be applied to the federal government.   Our test for whether land is occupied is whether that land has been settled. Now it can be settled -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Has been settled? "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " It can be settled -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " The whole point of Bighorn is that you don't want that land settled. "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " And -- and -- and that -- that's true.   The -- the -- by designating the land as a national forest, the federal government has prevented private settlement. What we're saying is that there are things the federal government can do, just like private settlers can do, that can result in the land being occupied.   We too can build buildings, roads, campsites, recreation areas. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Well, how much is enough?

"}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " No, we wouldn't -- we wouldn't say that -- that putting a shed in one place occupies that much land.   I think a -- a good piece of guidance is our regulation, which we cite in our brief, which prohibits discharge of a firearm within 150 yards of a building or a home.   And so we -- we would consider the area -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " So you occupy the land if nobody can fire a gun in it? "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " No, it's -- it's 150 yards around a -- a campsite, a building, a residence, or other occupied area.   So we would -- we would take the -- the development of the land as sort of the anchor point and then look around 150 yards, and that would be the land -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Just so I understand, so at 151 yards, Mr. Herrera could take an elk? "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " At a hundred and -- correct. I mean, there has to be some line that we draw between land that's occupied and unoccupied.   I -- I think there is some burden on the hunter to know where he or she can hunt.   And I think seeing a building 150 yards away is not too much to ask. "}, {"speaker": "Neil Gorsuch", "text": " Counsel, along those lines, you asked for remand for an evidentiary exploration of whether the land here was occupied.   At the same time, though, you -- you point out that the district court didn't rely on the occupation as a basis for its relying on the Tenth Circuit opinion.

Why should we allow a remand for that? You know, it's a new argument raised in this Court for the first time.   Why should we address it at all? "}, {"speaker": "Frederick Liu", "text": " I -- I -- I think -- I think the district court -- I think the state trial court in this case, to be more precise, did -- was open to having an evidentiary hearing from the get-go, and it was only after the state trial court determined that the issue could be resolved as a matter of law that that evidentiary hearing was canceled.

We agree that these issues are difficult and the circumstances of this case are particularly unusual because the alternative judgment that was inserted into the case by the Tenth Circuit in Repsis was done so at the appellate level and not in the court of first instance. And not even Restatement Section 27 addresses this precise instance.   So we -- we would caution the Court against delving into these tricky preclusion issues. We do think the issue was not raised or -- or addressed below.   I think the clearest place to look for this is -- is page 11 of the state's supplemental brief addressing the issue preclusion in -- in the courts below. "}, {"speaker": "John G.

Knepper", "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Herrera's claims are identical to those presented 25 years ago by his sovereign on his behalf in the case Crow Tribe v. Repsis. Nothing since Repsis, including the decision by this Court in Mille Lacs, merits a -- an exception to this Court's repeated command that, once the appeals are over, a final judgment binds the parties and they may not renew the same dispute in another forum. Repsis ruled that this particular treaty right had expired, and this Court should not on collateral review allow it to spring back, especially as, when you look at the decision in Mille Lacs, Mille Lacs went out of its way not to overrule the result in Race Horse. Much of -- much of the -- the argument over preclusion, Your Honor, has to do with whether there has been a change in intervening law, and this case is particularly ill-suited to find such a change. The treaty text has not changed. There are no essential facts that have changed, because, when one looks at the underlying case brought by the Crow Tribe, in the complaints and the Joint Appendix, it was brought at the broadest possible level of abstraction. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Maybe I'm not understanding this correctly because it's complicated, but I thought there are two separate issues in respect to issue preclusion. One has to do with Repsis.   And Repsis was a case that held on your side.   And there haven't been much changes since then.   But your argument, their argument about that one is you never raised the issue.   The district court never decided it.   The Tenth Circuit just on its own wrote the thing in there.   And so you forfeited that one. Now, in respect to the second and different question, it's whether Race Horse bars their claim.   A totally different question.   And there, not with Repsis, the basic argument is the law changed in Mille Lacs. It doesn't in the Restatement or where we've quoted the Restatement, which we have in a number of cases, Bobby v. Bies, Limbach v. Hooven, et cetera, we haven't said that you are free to bring a new issue only where the court has overruled the case that came against you. We said you're free to bring a new one when there's a change in the applicable legal context.   Okay? So their argument there is there is a change in the applicable legal context.   One, no more equal footing doctrine and you win.   Two, no more just become a state and you win.   Okay? That's a change in the applicable legal context since Race Horse relied on those two things. Now that's my understanding of the argument.   So either tell me I'm wrong and explain what the standing -- what the correct argument is, or answer those points. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " Okay.   Your Honor, the -- there's not complete clarity within this Court's jurisprudence as to what kind of a change in the legal context is sufficient. Some say, you know, Stauffer Chemical talks about a significant change or a major doctrinal shift.   The -- you know, the language in Bobby v. Bies says just a change in the applicable law. You know, from -- from the state's perspective, if -- if any change to a precedent relied upon by a prior court, either it's called into question by this Court or it's called into question by a court of appeals in some subsequent cases is sufficient to undo the preclusive effect of the first opinion, then I think there are very few cases that will have preclusive effect because, you know, one need only go through the opinion and say: Well, this -- this case was cited by the court somewhere, and -- and by citing that case, they must have relied upon it and -- and, boy, look over here, there -- there's another case that has -- that has questioned it, not being necessarily overruled. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " But, Mr. Knepper, I -- I think this isn't just any change.   I -- I think a fair reading would suggest that what Mille Lacs did was to repudiate the reasoning that Race Horse had in it with respect to exactly the question before us. And it's true that it did not go all the way to overruling the case, but it -- it came up like half a step short of that.   It basically said the case was wrong, and then it found some distinction that wasn't even relevant to the question and said we don't have to overrule it because there is this distinction. But all the reasoning is repudiated. Wouldn't you think -- wouldn't you say that that's right? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " Your Honor, the court did not overrule the approach to treaty interpretation.   It said the key is looking at what the intent of the parties is. It reached a conclusion that -- that a court today might not reach.   It might reach a different conclusion.   But that argument that the court should have said something different is -- is at root the argument that the court -- that the -- that the -- that the decision was wrong. "}, {"speaker": "Elena Kagan", "text": " Well, just to make this more concrete, I mean, as I understand it, Race Horse essentially said that these treaty rights expired upon statehood.   And Mille Lacs comes in and says that's a wrong thing to say. Treaty rights don't expire upon statehood. So that seems like a pretty relevant change in the law. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " Well, Your Honor, there's -- there's -- there's one subtlety, I think, from the 19th Century law to the 20th Century law that's being overlooked here, and that is this Court's decision in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock.   It was not until 1903 that any party believed that Congress could unilaterally overrule or repeal a treaty. That -- the assumption in the 19th Century was there had to be bargained-for consideration.   And so the Race Horse court, when it's looking at this treaty question, is saying: What was the intent of the parties? And it reaches the conclusion that the intent of the parties was -- and this is restated from Mille Lacs -- that this was a -- it was clearly contemplated that this would be a temporary hunting right so long as the hunting grounds remained unoccupied and owned by the United States and that that terminated at statehood. Now it was -- it was not terminated by -- it was not so much that the statehood as a legal act made it terminate.   It was that the treaty itself envisioned termination at statehood.   And because the parties agreed that it would terminate at statehood, the treaty did so. "}, {"speaker": "Brett M. Kavanaugh", "text": " The oddity is that, as Justice Kagan says, in Mille Lacs, we say that the holding of Race Horse or the reasoning that statehood automatically terminates treaty rights for off-reservation activity, that's no longer good, and then, on the alternative holding, as we characterized it from Rate -- Race Horse, we say that language, the precar -- temporary and precarious, that language is also no good.   Right? Even on the alternative holding, it's not as if the Court in Mille Lacs said: Oh, everything from Race Horse is good on the alternative holding.   It either ditched it or recharacterized it or something. How would you make sense of what the rule is that's preserved by Mille Lacs? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " I think, Your Honor, the rule preserved by Mille Lacs is that the treaty language that was present in Race Horse, which is identical to the treaty language in the Crow -- the treaty with the Crows, expresses an intent by the parties that the off-reservation hunting right would terminate at statehood. "}, {"speaker": "Stephen G. Breyer", "text": " Well, you have this language right here in Mille Lacs: Treaty rights are not impliedly terminated upon statehood.   The Race Horse decision, to the contrary, was informed by that court's conclusion that the Indian treaty rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty.   And then it goes on to say that's not so.   I mean, I can read it to you, but isn't that what it says? And so treaty rights are not implied. Now that would seem like a change in the law because they said in Race Horse treaty rights were impliedly -- the Indian treaty rights were impliedly repealed by statehood of Wyoming.

In other words, it -- it has a -- it has a historical value as well, all of these decisions were made during the 19th Century. And -- and the Court in that case looked at the treaty text and said: \"Unoccupied lands,\" that could be construed broadly, it could be construed narrowly, but when construed in pari materia with the language of borders of the hunting districts, it applies only to lands of such a character as would be embodied in hunting districts.   And the Court read that as a term of art. "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " All right.   So that's wonderful.   Tell me how a national park isn't a traditional hunting district.   I mean, the government says we're not going to keep it unoccupied.   They open it up to hunting. What was different back then? "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " Your Honor, I -- that's -- "}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " Unoccupied and people went hunting. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " Well, Your Honor, that's where the Race Horse Court's evaluation of the history at that time is so important because the Race Horse Court looked at Yellowstone National Park, and what the Race Horse Court said was Yellowstone National Park was created almost immediately after the treaty with the Crows was signed.   The -- Yellowstone National Park is actually within the Crow hunting district.   And the Crow hunting district is a very large area, but Yellowstone National Park, which is an area the size of Connecticut, it's not just geysers, was carved out of the hunting district, and then the United States proceeded over the entire time, beginning in 1872 and then through the '80s, 1880s, to say to tribes: You may not hunt here.   This is off limits.   We have occupied this land. Now that doesn't mean that there are structures there, but that the -- that the -- the federal government's arrival and the federal government's setting this land aside has the effect of occupying the land, and that the -- the tribe does not require -- or the treaty does not require only -- that the tribe refrain from hunting only on land where it can identify a structure.

Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I know that when we're interpreting a treaty, we look at the background and circumstances in interpreting the language, and -- but your argument's a pretty stark distinction, occupied doesn't really have anything to do with hunting.   And yet you're -- you're sort of saying, well, when they said \"occupied,\" they meant outside the hunting district.   And that's a bit of a stretch. I know we try to look at the background to illuminate the language, but, here, it seems to me you're just substituting an entirely different concept. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " Your Honor, I -- I think that the precise question is what did they mean by \"occupied\" and what -- what -- what was land -- what did land have to look like in -- "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Yeah, but your argument is, you know, what did they mean by \"cow\" and you're saying they meant \"horse.\" They're two totally different concepts. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " I -- I'm not -- I'm not sure that's what the State's argument is, but -- (Laughter.) "}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " I'm sure it's not. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " But -- but I -- I think -- I think there are -- there are -- you know, you can envision, for example, a piece of private land where there is no -- there are no structures, and in that piece of private land, I think there's no question Mille Lacs affirms this, that there would be no right to hunt on that piece of private land, even though it looks like nothing, it looks like a vast expanse of nothing. And so then the question is, when the government has a specific purpose for which it reserves land, and the government has done so and did so throughout the 19th Century in terms of military reservations for forts, which is a larger portion of land than just the fort itself, as well as public reservations, which would be either the national forest or the national parks, the government has said not -- not that this land is unoccupied but, rather, we occupy this land.   This is our land.   We dictate who comes in, who comes out, what they're allowed to do while they're there. This -- we have -- we have taken this land over and managed it in a completely different way. From -- from the -- from the State's perspective, it's one of the reasons why we're not concerned about some of the -- the questions of whether Mr. Herrera -- whether the United States could solve this another way. In other words, this is a federal -- a national forest.   The current regulations for the national forest say you can only hunt in the national forest if you have either permission from the -- the forest superintendent or you're hunting in conjunction with a state memorandum of understanding. The state memorandum of understanding for the Bighorn National Forest makes no reference whatsoever to hunting outside of Wyoming's permitting regime. Now, if the United States wants a different regime on its property, the United States is free to provide that different regime and free to make distinctions.

The Crow Tribe will be here forever, as they have been since time immemorial, and the State of Wyoming has no intention of disappearing. And our concern with -- with sort of a -- with sort of a -- a notion that the change in law is all that's necessary to remove preclusion is that it creates the possibility that people -- that parties just lurk, that they wait and wait.

Reason 3 we think isn't any good either.   We think the opposite.   And, therefore, Race Horse doesn't bind us. Now there's -- possibly they should have added a fourth thing, and, therefore, the words Race Horse is overruled, but the Court didn't.   I can understand that.   I can perhaps understand that better than you.   There are a lot of things to do every day, and you have to write your opinions and you start putting in a word like \"overruled\" and some of your colleagues might think: Don't do it, you don't know what you're getting, et cetera.   All we have to decide for this case is that Race Horse doesn't bind us, okay? So maybe we should say Race Horse is overruled.   But the three big reasons, now, are they little reasons or big reasons? I would say the equal footing doctrine is a major change to deny that. I would say to deny that they lose their territory when they come into the state is a major change, to say, no, that isn't so. And, therefore, I thought maybe it fits within what you're talking about.   It has to be a fairly big deal in change.   It sounds like a big deal. And then you have another argument, which is, of course, that we will get to perhaps, it's not unoccupied.   And, there, it's more open, but you have the problem that the treaty is filled with that word \"unoccupied\" seeming to mean not occupied by white settlers. And that's what the government thinks. Well, the language in the treaty's supporting that.   And are there any white settlers in that park? No, not one to my knowledge.   Maybe there's a games keeper.   But see? Okay.

"}, {"speaker": "Sonia Sotomayor", "text": " We're forgetting the other side in this discussion, because the tribe has a subsistence right.   I know under the facts of this case you're claiming the killings were not for subsistence, an open question, I'm not taking a side on that. But assuming that the treaty right was given to -- to protect the Indian subsistence rights and that their claim, taking it at face value, is accurate, that they were on hard times and needed food to feed their families, that balance is not yours alone to make.   It belongs to the government and it belongs to the Indian tribes as well. "}, {"speaker": "John G. Knepper", "text": " Your Honor, that's why the State has been so accepting.   I mean, the State does not resist the notion that, as proprietor, the United States could come in and give all of the benefits that Mr. Herrera seeks, including subsistence hunting. What -- what -- what the advantage of that approach would be is that all of the questions that -- that -- that sort of tail out of that, when, how, but also subsistence, subsistence for whom, you know, the question of hunting licenses being given to the tribe rather than under the current situation where, you know, the United States' position as to the Crow treaty was not made clear to the State of Wyoming until the filing in this Court in -- in support of a grant of certiorari. The United States had -- had no role whatsoever in the Repsis litigation that we can find.   In fact, I believe the United States declined to participate at all.

There was -- there was a statute allowing creation of the national forests.

"}, {"speaker": "John G. Roberts, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hicks, two minutes. "}, {"speaker": "George W. Hicks, Jr.", "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Just a few points. First, in response to the idea that Mille Lacs simply didn't change the approach, I -- I think that's wrong for all the reasons that Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan identified.   But I want to go a little bit further than the sentence that you read, Justice Breyer. And it's the sentence on page 207/208. Now earlier in the opinion the Court had said: We concluded that the particular rights in the Race Horse treaty at issue there were not intended to survive statehood. Then on 207/208: The Race Horse Court's decision that Indian treaty rights were impliedly repealed by Wyoming statehood was informed by that court's conclusion that the Indian treaty rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty over natural resources and, thus, that Congress could not have intended the rights to survive statehood. And that's an important last phrase of that sentence because it's tying the entire Race Horse holding to this mistaken premise that Indian treaty rights are irreconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources. I think that's a key sentence. And I think, frankly, that kind of undercuts a lot of the idea that even the holding -- this second holding of Race Horse is still viable.   Again, we don't think you need to take the next step to expressly overrule the outcome in Race Horse.   But, if you, you know, want to do that, you can follow the roadmap that you have in Limbach and Sunnen, where you had almost exactly this situation. The second point is simply to this idea of the occupation and what \"occupied\" means.   Everything in the evidence, in the historical evidence, is that both parties to the treaty understood \"occupation\" to mean some sort of actual physical presence and nothing about simply a legal declaration that the federal government was going to do something. And certainly, under the Indian canons of construction, that's a reasonable reading that is entitled to be given to the Indians. And the last point on conservation necessity, you know, this discussion I think just demonstrates that if the Court finds that the -- the treaty right is valid and has not been terminated, Wyoming still has the ability to regulate its -- its wildlife, its natural resources, simply according to the conservation necessity standard like every other state already has to do.
